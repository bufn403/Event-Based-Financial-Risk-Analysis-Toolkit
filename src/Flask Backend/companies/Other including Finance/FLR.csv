We operate in a complex and rapidly changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price could be materially adversely affected.Summary Risk Factors
The following summarizes the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and stock price. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.Risks Related to our Operations•We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.•Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on new awards.•The nature of our contracts, particularly our lump-sum contracts, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may not be recoverable and may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on us.•Intense competition in the EPC industry can impact our revenue and profits.•Our ability to grow requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.•The success of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on us.•We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.•Cybersecurity breaches of our systems and IT could adversely impact us.•Systems and IT interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate.•We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.•Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.•Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.12Table of Contents•Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.•Our actual results could differ from the estimates used to prepare our financial statements.•If we experience delays or defaults in client payments, we could be negatively impacted.•Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.•Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.•It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.•If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.•Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on us.•The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.•Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.•Climate change, natural disasters and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on us.•Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to sustainability practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks.•We may be unsuccessful in implementing our strategic initiatives.Risks Related to Indebtedness and other Credit Related Risks •Adverse credit and financial market conditions, including increasing or continued high interest rates, could impair our clients', our partners' and our own borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect us.•Our indebtedness could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.•We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with financial assurances.Legal and Regulatory Risks•We are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.•Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.•We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.•We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.•Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could impair our ability to compete for contracts.•New or changing legal requirements could adversely affect us.•Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us.Risks Related to our Equity and Corporate Governance Documents•If we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.•Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Risks Related to our OperationsWe are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.The demand for our services is dependent upon our clients' capital investments. Our clients' interest in approving new projects, budgets for capital expenditures and need for our services have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by, among other things, poor economic conditions (including inflation, slow growth or recession, changes to governments' fiscal or monetary policy and higher interest rates), low oil prices, political uncertainties and currency fluctuations. Clients have been and remain selective in how they allocate their capital, especially the larger scale projects in which we specialize. For example, in our Energy Solutions segment, capital expenditures by our clients are influenced by factors such as prevailing hydrocarbon prices and expectations about future prices for underlying commodities, technological advances, the costs of exploration, production and delivery of product, domestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions and other similar factors. There is no guarantee that current oil prices will be sufficient to justify clients' capital expenditures, and the timing and extent of any future improvements in demand remain uncertain. Industries served by that segment and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services.13Table of ContentsOur revenue and earnings are largely dependent on new awards.The awarding and timing of projects is unpredictable and driven by our clients. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors including a client's decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, oil prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid on due to price, a client's perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater risks or include terms and conditions that we might not deem acceptable, especially when the markets for the services we typically offer are relatively soft. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results can fluctuate depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated. Additionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs in recent years, and responsive changes in policy by foreign jurisdictions, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries. We cannot predict the outcome of changing trade policies or other unanticipated economic or political conditions, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any worldwide economic recovery or downturn or in the markets that we serve.The nature of our contracts, particularly our lump-sum contracts, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may not be recoverable and may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on us.Because our projects are often technically complex, with multiple phases occurring over several years, we incur risks in our project execution activities. These risks could result in project delays, cost overruns or other problems and can include the following:•Evolving estimates related to productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including with respect to the impacts of inflation on lump-sum contracts;•Unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;•Inaccurate representations of site conditions and unanticipated changes in the project execution plan;•Project modifications creating unanticipated costs or delays and failure to properly manage project modifications;•Inability to achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards with regard to engineering, construction or project management obligations;•Insufficient or inadequate project execution tools and systems needed to record, track, forecast and control cost and schedule;•Reliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current economic and/or execution conditions;•Failure to accurately estimate the timing and cost of projects, including due to inflation, supply chain disruption, rising construction costs or unforeseen increases in the cost of labor;•Unanticipated increases in the cost of raw materials, components or equipment, including due to inflation or the imposition of import tariffs;•Failure to properly make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards;•Failure to properly assess and update appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures;•Poor performance of our clients, partners, subcontractors, suppliers or other third parties;•Delays or productivity issues caused by weather; and•Changes in local laws or difficulties or delays in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals.14Table of ContentsThese and other risks have in the past, and may in the future, result in our failure to achieve contractual cost or schedule commitments, safety performance, overall client satisfaction or other performance criteria. As a result, we may receive lower fees or lose our ability to earn incentive fees. In other cases, our fee will not change but we will have to continue to perform work without additional fees until the performance criteria is achieved. We may also incur liquidated damages if we fail to complete a project on schedule. In addition, if we fail to meet guaranteed performance or quality standards, we may be held responsible under the guarantee or warranty provisions of our contract for cost impact to the client, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or an obligation to re-perform work. To the extent these events occur, the total cost to the project (including any liquidated damages) could be material and could, in some circumstances, equal or exceed the full value of the contract. In such events, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and negatively impacted.In circumstances where the contract is lump-sum or the revenue is otherwise fixed, we bear significant risk for delays and cost overruns. Reimbursable contract types, such as those that include negotiated hourly billing rates, may restrict the kinds or amounts of costs that are reimbursable, therefore exposing us to the risk that we may incur certain costs in executing these contracts that are above our estimates and not recoverable from our clients.Intense competition in the EPC industry can impact our revenue and profits.We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These markets require substantial resources, investment in technology and skilled personnel. We have seen a continuing influx of non-traditional competitors offering below-market pricing while accepting greater risk. Competition places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and could cause us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk of losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in our markets, presenting us with challenges to maintain acceptable profit margins. To the extent we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could experience reduced profitability.Our ability to grow requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.The success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract, develop and retain personnel, including engineers, project management, craft employees and management, who have the necessary and required experience and expertise, and who will perform these services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for experienced personnel is intense. It may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may be unable to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to deploy qualified personnel. Also, it may be difficult to replace personnel who hold government required credentials. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel, including a preference by some candidates to work remotely, could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects. In addition, as costs related to our workforce are dependent on market conditions, inflationary pressure has increased, and may continue to increase, labor costs in certain geographic areas.As some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age or otherwise leave the company, we need to provide for smooth transitions, which requires succession planning to identify and integrate new personnel into leadership roles. Changes in our management team may disrupt our business and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate executives or other key personnel could adversely affect our results. If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected, the costs of executing our existing and future projects may increase.In addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with project needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on us. Increased labor costs can also impact our customers' decision making with respect to the viability or timing of certain projects, which could result in project delays or cancellations and in turn have a material adverse impact on us.The success of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on us.In the ordinary course of business in our industry, we execute specific projects and otherwise conduct certain operations through joint ventures, partnerships and other collaborative arrangements (collectively, ""ventures""). We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with our client; however, services may be performed directly by the venture, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof.15Table of ContentsOur success in many markets is impacted by the presence or capability of our partners. If we are unable to compete alone, or with a quality partner, our ability to win work and successfully complete our contracts may be impacted. Differences in opinions or views between venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues, which could adversely affect the business and operations of our ventures. In many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement.At times, we also participate in ventures with other parties. In such instances, we may have limited control over venture decisions and actions, including ICFR, which may have an impact on our business. If internal control problems arise within a venture, or if our venture partners have financial or operational issues, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The success of our ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. If our venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their obligations, the venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services and to meet any performance guarantees. From time to time, in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, we may accept risks or responsibilities for the venture that are not necessarily proportionate with the reward we expect to receive or that may differ from risks or responsibilities we would normally accept in our own operations. We may also be subject to joint and several liability under the contracts for venture projects. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for us with respect to the venture, and in turn, our business and operations. In addition, a failure by a venture partner to comply with applicable regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or, in the case of government contracts, even debarment.We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.Some of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified suppliers, our ability to successfully or timely complete a project could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in lump-sum contracts, we may suffer losses on them. If a supplier or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, technology, equipment or services as required under a contract to us, our joint venture partner, our client or any other party involved in the project for any reason, or provides supplies, technology, equipment or services that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies, technology, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact our profitability. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. These risks may be intensified during an economic downturn if these suppliers or subcontractors experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the services or supplies necessary for our business.  A failure by a third-party subcontractor or supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension, or in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Cybersecurity breaches of our systems and IT could adversely impact us.We face risks related to cybersecurity threats, which could adversely affect us. Our business is dependent on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and sensitive information, including personal data of our employees, subcontractors, suppliers, business partners and clients. While we have implemented various measures to protect our systems and data from unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, and other security breaches and have endeavored to require our vendors to adhere to industry recognized security standards, these measures may be insufficient to prevent all security breaches or cyber-attacks. In addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to IT systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. For example, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence may intensify our cybersecurity risks.In the event of a security breach or cyber-attack, we may experience operational disruptions, financial losses, legal claims, and reputational damage. We may also incur significant costs to remediate the effects of such incidents, including costs associated with investigating the incident, repairing or replacing damaged systems and compensating affected parties.We may also be subject to legal and regulatory actions, investigations, and penalties related to cybersecurity incidents, which may result in significant fines, sanctions, and legal fees, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. In addition, data protection and cybersecurity laws are continuously evolving at a rapid pace and on a global 16Table of Contentslevel, which add heightened risk and additional costs in assessing, implementing and managing compliance measures that affect business operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a negative impact on us.While we maintain insurance that specifically covers cybersecurity threats, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that we might experience.Systems and IT interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate.We are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays that may be planned for upgrades or that may be unplanned. Unplanned interruptions could result from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, malicious code, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error and similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays, loss of critical or sensitive data (including personal or financial data) or loss of funds; could delay or prevent operations (including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results); and could adversely affect our reputation or our operating results. While we have and require the maintenance of reasonable safeguards designed to protect against unavailability or loss of data, these safeguards may not be sufficient. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and IT could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. Our systems implementations also may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business.We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.Our business is subject to international economic and political conditions that change (sometimes frequently) for reasons that are beyond our control. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue and profits will continue to come from non-U.S. projects for the foreseeable future.Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:•abrupt changes in government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;•embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;•restrictions on currency movement;•tax or tariff changes and withholding requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including logistical and communication challenges;•U.S. government trade or other policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate;•other regional, social, political and economic instability, including recessions and other economic crises;•natural disasters and public health crises, including pandemics;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets;•international hostilities, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in the imposition by the U.S. and other nations of restrictive actions against Russia and certain banks, companies and individuals; and•unrest, civil strife, acts of war, terrorism and insurrection.17Table of ContentsThe lack of a well-developed legal system in some of the countries where we operate may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights or to defend ourself against claims made by others. We operate in locations where there is a significant amount of political risk. In addition, nationalization, military action or continued unrest could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere, and increase our security costs. Our level of exposure to these risks may vary with each project, depending on the location of the project and its stage of completion. For example, our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development phase, such as engineering, will generally be less than our risk exposure on a project that is in the construction phase. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions and risks, we may experience project disruptions and losses. Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.Our backlog generally consists of projects for which we have an executed contract or commitment with a client and reflects our expected revenue from the contract or commitment, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable or will not be subject to delay or suspension. Project cancellations, scope adjustments or deferrals, or foreign currency fluctuations may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the value of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn; or, may cause the rate at which we perform on our backlog to decrease. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them allowing clients to cancel projects. Our contracts typically provide for the payment of fees earned through the date of termination and the reimbursement of costs incurred including demobilization costs. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. During periods of economic slowdown, or decreases and/or instability in oil prices, the risk of projects being suspended, delayed or canceled generally increases. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and our profits.Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.We often work on complex projects, frequently in geographically remote or high-risk locations that are subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain safety. In addition, our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment, dangerous processes or substances or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, increasing project costs and raising our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries or loss of life, the completion of a project could be delayed and we could experience investigations or litigation. Although we have a safety function to implement effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability. Despite these activities we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel, nor can we guarantee our work, equipment or supplies will be free from damage.Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, severe weather conditions, public health crises, supply chain disruption, political crises or other catastrophic events, could negatively impact our ability to operate or increase our costs to operate. Such events may result in disruptions to our operations; evacuation of personnel; increased labor and material costs or shortages; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such events, unless a contract provision provides us with relief from our obligations. The extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our clients. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are impacted by such an event, our operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients, which may reduce our profits and result in losses.Our actual results could differ from the estimates used to prepare our financial statements. In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:•determination of profitability;18Table of Contents•recognition of project incentives, awards, change orders, claims or other variable consideration we expect to receive;•estimated amounts for project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;•collectability of receivables and the need and amount of any allowance;•income tax provisions and related valuation allowances;•determination of potential liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and•accruals for other estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves and receivables.Estimates are based on management's reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results due to changes in facts and circumstances, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, we recognize contract revenue as work on a contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at any point is that percentage of total estimated revenue that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when such estimates are revised. Such adjustments could be material and could result in reduced profitability.If we experience delays or defaults in client payments, we could be negatively impacted.Because of the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from clients in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they come due. Some of our clients have found it difficult to pay our invoices timely, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients for our large projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time, it is difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. In addition, clients may request extension of the payment terms otherwise agreed to under our contracts. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.We have a significant portfolio of government contracts, including those that we have in place with the DOE and U.S. Department of Defense. U.S. government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by government agencies and profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. U.S. government contracts are also subject to uncertainties associated with congressional funding, including the potential impacts of budget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. A significant reduction in federal government spending or a change in budgetary priorities could reduce demand for our services, cancel or delay federal projects, and result in the closure of federal facilities and significant personnel reductions. Changes in U.S. government priorities, which can occur due to policy changes or economic changes, could adversely impact our revenues. The U.S. government is under no obligation to maintain program funding at any specific level, and funds for a program may even be eliminated. Our U.S. government clients may terminate or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice.In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR""), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards (""CAS""), the Service Contract Act and Department of Defense security regulations. Failure to comply with any of these regulations and other government requirements may result in contract price adjustments, financial penalties or contract termination. Our U.S. government contracts are also subject to audits, cost reviews and investigations by U.S. government oversight agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (the ""DCAA""). The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal controls and policies (including our labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems). The DCAA also has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the FAR and CAS. The DCAA presents its findings to the Defense Contract Management Agency (""DCMA""). Should the DCMA determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contract and applicable statutes and regulations, or if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities, payments to us may be disallowed or we could be required to refund previously collected payments. Additionally, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, suspension or debarment from future government contracts, and qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. These suits may remain under seal (and hence, be unknown to us) for some time while the government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. Furthermore, if we have significant 19Table of Contentsdisagreements with our government clients concerning costs incurred, negative publicity could arise, which could adversely affect our industry reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts in the government arena or otherwise.Most U.S. government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions that generally require those contractors that have been previously awarded the contract to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under the contract. Such processes require successful contractors to anticipate requirements and develop rapid-response bid and proposal teams as well as dedicated supplier relationships and delivery systems to react to these needs. We face rigorous competition and significant pricing pressures in order to win these task orders. If we are not successful in containing costs or able to timely respond to government requests, we may not win additional awards. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may be impacted in our pursuit of work by government policies designed to protect small businesses and under- represented minority contractors. Many of our U.S. government contracts require security clearances. Depending upon the level of clearance required, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing government clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them.Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.We are subject to income taxes where we do business. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could change our overall tax rate, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our judgments could prove inaccurate. There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, our ability to realize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. Future changes in our tax rate or adverse changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund our operations in other countries due to tax laws in different jurisdictions. It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.We maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Although we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of our insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their obligations to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could increase and our business operations could be interrupted.If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We provide services to the DOE and the nuclear energy industry in the on-going maintenance and modification of nuclear facilities as well as decontamination and decommissioning activities of nuclear plants. The Price-Anderson Act generally indemnifies parties performing services to nuclear power plants and DOE contractors; however, not all of our activities are covered. Thus, if the Price-Anderson Act indemnification protections do not apply to our services, or if the exposure occurs outside of the U.S. in a region that does not have protections comparable to the Price-Anderson Act, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by our client's refusal to contract with us, by our inability to obtain commercially reasonable insurance or third party indemnification, or by the potentially significant monetary damages we could incur.Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on us.Our contracts may subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project revenue is denominated in a currency different than the expected costs. Contracts may be denominated in different currencies at various points in time as a project progresses. We may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by implementing hedging strategies utilizing derivatives. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk, and as a result, our profitability could be affected.20Table of ContentsOur monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are subject to remeasurement. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly due to foreign currency volatility.The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.A few clients, including the U.S. government, state governments and governmental agencies comprise a significant portion of our revenue. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, fail to renew or terminate their contracts with us at any time. Most of our contracts have ""termination for convenience"" provisions in them. The loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.Our success is impacted by our ability to differentiate our services through our technologies and know-how. This includes the ability to protect intellectual property rights. We utilize a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our interests. However, these methods only provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our interests. Our employees, contractors and joint venture partners are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights. This can be especially true in certain foreign countries where intellectual property does not have equivalent protections as in the U.S., or when our joint venture partner is a competitor who will gain access to our procedures and know-how while working with us in the performance of services.Our clients require broad ownership rights in the work product and other materials we deliver. If we are unable to retain ownership of our intellectual property and improvements thereto, it may affect our ability to provide similar services to other clients in the future, which ultimately, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Our competitors or others may independently develop technology substantially similar to our trade secret technology or we may be unsuccessful in preserving our intellectual property rights in the future. Our intellectual property rights could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or infringed upon. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention.In addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. There is a risk that we may not sufficiently protect against improper use, access or dissemination and, as a result, we could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on us.We also hold licenses from third parties utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be adversely affected. When we license our intellectual property to third parties, the scope of such license grant is generally limited. If such third party exceeds the scope of the license grant, and if we are unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights, our revenue and margins will be adversely impacted, and the value of our intellectual property portfolio may be adversely affected.Climate change, natural disasters and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on us.Climate-related events, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, freezing conditions, and other natural disasters, may have a long-term impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our businesses. For example, a catastrophic natural disaster could negatively impact any of our office locations and the locations of our clients. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is critical to our operations. Accordingly, a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our clients’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages, supply chain disruptions, project delays, financial losses and additional costs to resume operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of cover, legal liability and reputational losses.Further, the risks caused by climate change span across the full spectrum of the industries we serve. The direct physical risks that climate change poses through chronic environmental changes, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, and acute events, such as hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, is common to each of these industries. Our clients could face increased costs to maintain their assets, which could result in reduced profitability and fewer resources for strategic investment. These types of physical risks could in turn lead to transitional risks (i.e., the degree to which society responds to the threat of climate change). For example, growing concerns about climate change may result in activism, protests, legislation, international 21Table of Contentsprotocols or treaties, regulation or other restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions or that otherwise seek to address climate change that could affect our clients, including those who (a) are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, such as our Energy Solutions clients, (b) emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or (c) emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such actions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on us. However, policy changes and climate legislation could also accelerate energy transition, including the development of carbon capture and storage projects, alternative transportation, alternative energy facilities, such as wind farms or nuclear reactors, or incentivize increased implementation of clean fuels projects, which could positively impact the demand for our services. We cannot predict when or whether any of these legislative proposals may become law or what effect will be on us and our clients.We may also incur additional expenses implementing U.S. and international regulations requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions and/or broader ESG-related factors. Compliance with such regulations and the associated potential costs is complicated by various countries and regions following different approaches to the regulation of climate change.Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to sustainability practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks. Investors, clients and other stakeholders have increasingly focused on the ESG practices of companies, including practices with respect to human capital, emissions and environmental impact and political spending. Expectations and requirements evolve rapidly and are largely out of our control, and our ESG initiatives and disclosures in response to such expectations and requirements may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), change in demand for certain services, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business or results of operations. While we have programs and initiatives in place related to our ESG practices, investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of our practices. In addition, our clients may require that we adhere to varying ESG standards. Our failure to comply with investor or client standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for these issues could also cause reputational harm to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, organizations that provide ratings information to investors on ESG matters may have unfavorable views on us, which may lead to negative sentiment.In addition, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on expectations and assumptions that may not be representative of current or actual risks, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters. In addition, we expect that there will likely be increasing levels of regulation, disclosure-related and otherwise, with respect to ESG matters. For example, the SEC has published proposed rules that would require companies to provide significantly expanded climate-related disclosures. Requirements from the SEC, European or other regulators may require us to incur significant costs to comply and distract our management and Board of Directors.We may be unsuccessful in implementing our strategic initiatives.We have announced a number of strategic initiatives, including plans to divest our remaining Stork operations and reduce our ownership of NuScale. Our ability to successfully execute these initiatives is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including regulatory intervention, which may negatively impact the realization of expected benefits. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute, competition, economic conditions, and other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on us. Divesting businesses involves risks and uncertainties, such as the difficulty separating assets related to such businesses from the businesses we retain, employee distraction, and the need to obtain regulatory approvals and other third-party consents, which potentially disrupts customer and vendor relationships. Such actions also involve significant costs and require time and attention of our management, which may divert attention from other business operations. Because of these challenges, as well as market conditions or other factors, anticipated divestitures may take longer or be costlier or generate fewer benefits than expected and may not be completed at all. If we are unable to complete the divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted. If we dispose of a business, we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or, even if such liabilities are assumed, we may have difficulties enforcing our rights, contractual or otherwise, against the buyer. We may retain exposure on financial or performance guarantees and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations, and potential liabilities that may arise under law because of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer.22Table of ContentsRisks Related to Indebtedness and other Credit Related RisksAdverse credit and financial market conditions, including increasing or continued high interest rates, could impair our clients', our partners' and our own borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect us.Our ability to generate cash is important for the funding of our operations, investing in ventures, the servicing of our indebtedness, paying dividends and making acquisitions. To the extent that existing cash balances and operating cash flow, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing will depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, including those arising due to events occurring in our industry, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; and those factors may affect our efforts to negotiate terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, if global economic, industry, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to establish or draw upon our credit facilities, or refinance borrowings as they mature, may be impacted. In addition, a downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of our borrowings or their refinancing, limit access to sources of financing or lead to other adverse consequences such as requirements for liens or other forms of financial assurance. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In addition, adverse credit and financial market conditions, including increasing or continued high interest rates, also adversely affect our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project award and execution delays, payment delays or defaults by our clients. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and profits.Our indebtedness could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our operating cash flow to servicing our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; and•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, challenges and opportunities, and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate.Our ability to service our debt will depend on our future operating performance and financial results, which may be subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial and business conditions. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may need to refinance all or part of our existing debt, borrow more money or sell securities or assets, some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may need to incur additional debt in the future in the ordinary course of business. Although the terms of our credit agreements and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt, there are limitations which may preclude us from incurring the desired amount.Our current debt and any future additional debt we may incur impose, or may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. In addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to accelerate payments due. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, we may need to obtain amendments to our credit agreements or waivers from the lenders to avoid default. These factors could have a material adverse effect on us.23Table of ContentsWe may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with financial assurances.It is a common industry practice for clients to require us to provide surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other forms of financial assurance as credit enhancements. Surety bonds, letters of credit or guarantees indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our contractual obligations. Historically, we have had strong surety bonding capacity due to our credit ratings, but bonding is provided at the surety's sole discretion. In addition, because of the overall limitations in worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to access sufficient surety bonding capacity to meet our total surety bonding needs. For letters of credit, we have historically had adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities, but any capacity that may be required in excess of our credit limits would be at our lenders' sole discretion. Failure to provide credit enhancements on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a variety of legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes. Our operating activities expose us to claims against us by clients, subcontractors or suppliers for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We may be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters, including shareholder litigation. During times of economic uncertainty, especially with regard to our commodity-based clients, claim frequencies and amounts tend to increase.In proceedings where it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or these liabilities may exceed our coverage. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposure, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Our professional liability coverage is on a ""claims-made"" basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could have a material adverse impact on us.In other legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes, we may be covered by indemnification agreements that may at times be difficult to enforce. Even if enforceable, it may be difficult to recover under these agreements if the indemnitor does not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, including for monetary damages. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. Such proceedings can also be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to operations and distracting to management, regardless of the outcome.Our failure to recover adequately on claims against clients, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.We occasionally bring claims against clients for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly provide notice or document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns and in some cases a loss on the project. These types of claims can occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional cost. These claims can result in lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and while unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. However, there is no assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts 24Table of Contentscommitted by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and damaged reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could distract management.We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Our policies mandate strict compliance with U.S. and foreign international trade laws. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the U.S., we are subject to regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of Treasury. From time to time, we identify certain inadvertent or potential export or related violations. These violations may include, for example, transfers without required governmental authorization. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts.Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could impair our ability to compete for contracts.Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with anti-corruption, export control and environmental regulations; federal procurement regulations, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive government information; regulations on lobbying or similar activities; regulations pertaining to the internal control over financial reporting; and various other applicable laws or regulations. The policies and precautions we take to prevent and detect fraud, misconduct or failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of fraud or misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, cancellation of contracts, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with government agencies, which could damage our reputation, weaken our ability to win contracts and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits.New or changing legal requirements could adversely affect us.Our business and results of operations could be affected by the passage of laws, policies and regulations. The implementation of trade barriers, countervailing duties, or border taxes, or the addition, relaxation or repeal of laws, policies and regulations regarding the industries and sectors in which we work could result in a decline in demand for our services, or may make the manner in which we perform our services, less profitable. Furthermore, changes to existing trade agreements may impact our business operations. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us and our clients.Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations. Our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, including nuclear and other radioactive materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. It is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations. The applicable regulations, as well as the length of time available to comply with those regulations, continue to develop and change. The cost of complying with regulations, satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we may be found responsible, or satisfying claims or judgments alleging personal injury, property damage or natural resource damages as a result of exposure to, or contamination by, hazardous materials, including as a result of commodities such as lead or asbestos-related products, could be substantial, may not be covered by insurance, could impact profitability and materially impact our operations.We are subject to a number of regulations such as those from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Commission and the European Union, which can have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations and investments. Delays in receiving necessary approvals, permits or licenses, the failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs, and other problems encountered during construction (including changes to such regulatory requirements) could have an adverse effect on us.25Table of ContentsA substantial portion of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to environmental matters. A reduction in the number or scope of these laws or regulations, or changes in government policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could significantly reduce the size of one of our markets and limit our opportunities for growth or reduce our revenue below current levels.Risks Related to our Equity and Corporate Governance DocumentsIf we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.We may in the future issue additional equity securities to pay for potential acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives. If we do issue additional equity securities, the issuance may dilute our earnings per share and stockholders' percentage ownership.Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Fluor is a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:•stockholders may not act by written consent;•there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting or to nominate a director for election; and•our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.These types of provisions in our charters and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our equity holders"
7,FLR,FLUOR CORP,2023-02-21,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We operate in a complex and rapidly changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price could be materially adversely affected.Summary Risk Factors

You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.13Table of ContentsRisks Related to our Operations•We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.•Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on new awards, which are driven by our clients.•The nature of our contracts, particularly our lump-sum contracts, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may not be recoverable and may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on us.•Intense competition in the EPC industry can impact our revenue and profits.•Our ability to grow requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.•The success of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on us.•We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.•Cybersecurity breaches of our systems and IT could adversely impact us.•Systems and IT interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate.•We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.•Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.••Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.•Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.•We must successfully manage the demands, supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of widespread health concerns, such as COVID.•Our actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.•If we experience delays or defaults in client payments, we could be negatively impacted.•Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.•Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.•It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.•If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.•Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on us.•The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.•Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.•Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.•Climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.•Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors with respect to sustainability practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks.Risks Related to Indebtedness and other Credit Related Risks •Adverse credit and financial market conditions, including increasing interest rates, could impair our clients', our partners' and our own borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect us.•Our indebtedness could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.•We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with financial assurances.Legal and Regulatory Risks•We are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.•Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.•We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.14Table of Contents•We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.•Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could impair our ability to compete for contracts.•New or changing legal requirements could adversely affect us.•Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us.Risks Related to Strategic Plans and Mergers & Acquisitions•We may be unsuccessful implementing our strategic and operational initiatives.•We may be unsuccessful integrating acquisitions or capitalizing on investments we make.Risks Related to our Preferred Stock and our Equity •Conversion of our CPS will dilute the ownership interest of existing common stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. •Our CPS has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect the value of the common stock, our liquidity and our financial condition.•Provisions attendant to our CPS may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to our common stockholders.•If we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.•Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Risks Related to our OperationsWe are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.The demand for our services is dependent upon the existence of clients with capital investments. Our clients' interest in approving new projects, budgets for capital expenditures and need for our services have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by, among other things, poor economic conditions (including inflation, slow growth or recession, changes to governments' fiscal or monetary policy and higher interest rates), low oil prices, political uncertainties and currency devaluations. Clients have been and remain selective in how they allocate their capital, especially the larger scale projects in which we specialize. For example, in our Energy Solutions segment, capital expenditures by our clients are influenced by factors such as prevailing hydrocarbon prices and expectations about future prices for underlying commodities, technological advances, the costs of exploration, production and delivery of product, domestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions and other similar factors. There is no guarantee that current oil prices will be sustained, and the timing and extent of any future improvements in demand remain uncertain. Industries served by that segment and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services.Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on new awards, which are driven by our clients.The awarding and timing of projects is unpredictable and driven by our clients. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors including a client's decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, oil prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid on due to price, a client's perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater risks or include terms and conditions that we might not deem acceptable, especially when the markets for the services we typically offer are relatively soft. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results can fluctuate depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated. Additionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs in recent years, and responsive changes in policy by foreign jurisdictions, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries. We cannot predict the outcome of changing trade policies or other unanticipated economic or political conditions, nor can we predict the timing, strength or duration of any worldwide economic recovery or downturn or in the markets that we serve.15Table of ContentsThe nature of our contracts, particularly our lump-sum contracts, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may not be recoverable and may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on us.Because our projects are often technically complex, with multiple phases occurring over several years, we incur risks in our project execution activities. These risks could result in project delays, cost overruns or other problems and can include the following:•Incorrect assumptions related to productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including with respect to the impacts of inflation on lump-sum contracts;•Unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;•Inaccurate representations of site conditions and unanticipated changes in the project execution plan;•Project modifications creating unanticipated costs or delays and failure to properly manage project modifications;•Inability to achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards with regard to engineering, construction or project management obligations;•Insufficient or inadequate project execution tools and systems needed to record, track, forecast and control cost and schedule;•Reliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current economic and/or execution conditions;•Failure to accurately estimate the timing and cost of projects, including due to inflation, supply chain disruption, rising construction costs or unforeseen increases in the cost of labor;•Unanticipated increases in the cost of raw materials, components or equipment, including due to inflation or the imposition of import tariffs;•Failure to properly make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards;•Failure to properly assess and update appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures;•Difficulties related to the performance of our clients, partners, subcontractors, suppliers or other third parties;•Delays or productivity issues caused by weather; and•Changes in local laws or difficulties or delays in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals.These and other risks have in the past and may in the future result in our failure to achieve contractual cost or schedule commitments, safety performance, overall client satisfaction or other performance criteria. As a result, we may receive lower fees or lose our ability to earn incentive fees. In other cases, our fee will not change but we will have to continue to perform work without additional fees until the performance criteria is achieved. We may also be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to complete a project on schedule. In addition, if we fail to meet guaranteed performance or quality standards, we may be held responsible under the guarantee or warranty provisions of our contract for cost impact to the client, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or an obligation to re-perform work. To the extent these events occur, the total cost to the project (including any liquidated damages we become liable to pay) could be material and could, in some circumstances, equal or exceed the full value of the contract. In such events, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and negatively impacted.In circumstances where the contract is lump-sum or the revenue is otherwise fixed, we bear significant risk for delays and cost overruns. Reimbursable contract types, such as those that include negotiated hourly billing rates, may restrict the kinds or amounts of costs that are reimbursable, therefore exposing us to the risk that we may incur certain costs in executing these contracts that are above our estimates and not recoverable from our clients.Intense competition in the EPC industry can impact our revenue and profits.We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These markets require substantial resources and investment in technology and skilled personnel. We also see a continuing influx of non-traditional competitors offering below-market pricing while accepting greater risk. Competition places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and could cause us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not 16Table of Contentsnormal or customary, thereby increasing the risk of losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in our markets, presenting us with challenges to maintain acceptable profit margins. To the extent we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose revenue and experience reduced profitability.Our ability to grow requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.The success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract, develop and retain personnel, including engineers, project management, craft employees and management, who have the necessary and required experience and expertise, and who will perform these services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense. It may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may be unable to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to deploy qualified personnel. Also, it may be difficult to replace personnel who hold government required credentials. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel, including a preference for some candidates to work remotely, could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects. In addition, as costs related to our workforce are dependent on market conditions, inflationary pressure has increased, and may continue to increase, labor costs in certain geographic areas.As some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age or otherwise leave the company, we need to provide for smooth transitions, which requires succession planning to identify and integrate new personnel into leadership roles. Changes in our management team may disrupt our business and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate executives or other key personnel could adversely affect our results. If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected, the costs of executing our existing and future projects may increase.In addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with project needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on us.The success of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on us.In the ordinary course of business in our industry, we execute specific projects and otherwise conduct certain operations through joint ventures, consortiums, partnerships and other collaborative arrangements (collectively, ""ventures""). We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with our client; however, services may be performed directly by the venture, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof.Our success in many markets is impacted by the presence or capability of our partners. If we are unable to compete alone, or with a quality partner, our ability to win work and successfully complete our contracts may be impacted. Differences in opinions or views between venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues, which could adversely affect the business and operations of our ventures. In many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement.At times, we also participate in ventures where we are not a controlling party or where we team with unaffiliated parties on a particular project. In such instances, we may have limited control over venture decisions and actions, including ICFR, which may have an impact on our business. If internal control problems arise within a venture, or if our venture partners have financial or operational issues, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The success of our ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. If our venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their obligations, the venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services and to meet any performance guarantees. From time to time, in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, we may accept risks or responsibilities for the venture that are not necessarily proportionate with the reward we expect to receive or that may differ from risks or responsibilities we would normally accept in our own operations. We may also be subject to joint and several liability under the contracts for venture projects. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for us with respect to the venture, and in turn, our business and operations. In addition, a failure by a venture partner to 17Table of Contentscomply with applicable regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or, in the case of government contracts, even debarment.We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.Some of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified suppliers, our ability to successfully or timely complete a project could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, technology, equipment or services as required under a contract to us, our joint venture partner, our client or any other party involved in the project for any reason, or provides supplies, technology, equipment or services that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies, technology, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact our profitability. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. These risks may be intensified during an economic downturn if these suppliers or subcontractors experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the services or supplies necessary for our business.  A failure by a third-party subcontractor or supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension, or in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Cybersecurity breaches of our systems and IT could adversely impact our ability to operate.We utilize, develop, install and maintain a number of IT systems. Various privacy and security laws require us to protect sensitive and confidential information from disclosure. In addition, we are bound by our contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information. Our computer systems, as well as those of our clients, partners, contractors and other vendors, face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hacking, viruses, malicious code, cyber attacks, phishing and other security incursions and system disruptions. As many of our employees use our computer systems to collaborate with colleagues in different geographic locations and access our systems remotely, we may be subject to heightened risks, including the risk of cyber attacks. While we endeavor to maintain or exceed industry-accepted security measures and technology to secure our computer systems and while we endeavor to ensure our cloud vendors that store our data maintain similar measures, these systems and the information stored on these systems are still subject to threats. There can be no assurance that our efforts, including cybersecurity training for our employees, will protect us against all threats. Further, as these security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to protect, detect and respond against such threats. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to IT systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. A party who circumvents our security measures, or those of our clients, contractors or other vendors, could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, improperly manipulate data, or cause damage or interruptions to systems. While to date we have not experienced any material impact as a result of cyber attacks, the ultimate impact of these and similar events remains unknown, and additional vulnerabilities may arise in the future. Any of these events could damage our reputation, result in litigation and regulatory fines and penalties, impact our operations (including our ability to report our financial results), or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance that specifically covers cybersecurity threats, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.In addition, new or evolving laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act, and other U.S. state and global emerging privacy laws, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and could potentially elevate our compliance costs. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant penalties and legal liability, which could have a negative impact on our results of operation.Systems and IT interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.We are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays that may be planned for upgrades or that may be unplanned. Unplanned interruptions could result from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays, loss of critical or sensitive data (including personal or financial data) or loss of funds; could delay or prevent operations (including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results); and could adversely affect our reputation or our operating results. While we have and require 18Table of Contentsthe maintenance of reasonable safeguards designed to protect against unavailability or loss of data, these safeguards may not be sufficient. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and IT could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. Our systems implementations also may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other IT disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business.We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.Our business is subject to international economic and political conditions that change (sometimes frequently) for reasons that are beyond our control. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue and profits will continue to come from non-U.S. projects for the foreseeable future.Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:•abrupt changes in government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;•embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;•restrictions on currency movement;•tax or tariff changes and withholding requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including logistical and communication challenges;•U.S. government trade or other policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate;•other regional, social, political and economic instability, including recessions and other economic crises;•natural disasters and public health crises, including pandemics;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets;•international hostilities, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in the imposition by the U.S. and other nations of restrictive actions against Russia and certain banks, companies and individuals; and•unrest, civil strife, acts of war, terrorism and insurrection.During the first quarter of 2022, we suspended any new investment in our Russian operations. Our backlog on projects in the impacted region is not significant to future revenue or margin. We continue to monitor the circumstances in Eastern Europe and are winding down our existing contractual obligations while complying with all regulatory limitations placed on new and existing business for projects and clients based in the region.The lack of a well-developed legal system in some of the countries where we operate may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights or to defend ourself against claims made by others. We operate in locations where there is a significant amount of political risk. In addition, nationalization, military action or continued unrest could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere, and increase our security costs. Our level of exposure to these risks may vary with each project, depending on the location of the project and its stage of completion. For example, our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development phase, such as engineering, will generally be less than our risk exposure on a project that is in the construction phase. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions and risks, we may experience project disruptions and losses. 19Table of ContentsOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.Our backlog generally consists of projects for which we have an executed contract or commitment with a client and reflects our expected revenue from the contract or commitment, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable or will not be subject to delay or suspension. Project cancellations, scope adjustments or deferrals, or foreign currency fluctuations may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the value of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn; or, may cause the rate at which we perform on our backlog to decrease. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them allowing clients to cancel projects. Our contracts typically provide for the payment of fees earned through the date of termination and the reimbursement of costs incurred including demobilization costs. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. During periods of economic slowdown, or decreases and/or instability in oil prices, the risk of projects being suspended, delayed or canceled generally increases. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and our profits.Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.We often work on complex projects, frequently in geographically remote or high-risk locations that are subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain safety. In addition, our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment, dangerous processes or substances or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, increasing project costs and raising our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries or loss of life, the completion of a project could be delayed and we could experience investigations or litigation. Although we have a safety function to implement effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability. Despite these activities we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel, nor can we guarantee our work, equipment or supplies will be free from damage.Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, severe weather conditions, public health crises such as COVID, supply chain disruption, political crises or other catastrophic events, could negatively impact our ability to operate or increase our costs to operate. Such events may result in disruptions to our operations; evacuation of personnel; increased labor and material costs or shortages; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such events, unless a contract provision provides us with relief from our obligations. The extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our clients. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are impacted by such an event, our operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients, which may reduce our profits and result in losses.We must successfully manage the demands, supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of widespread health concerns, such as COVID.Our business operations, results of operations and financial position has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by epidemics, pandemics and similar widespread public health concerns, such as COVID, including as a result of the actions taken by international federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities in response, including vaccine mandates, quarantines, government restrictions on movement, distancing, business closures and suspensions, canceled events and activities, isolation, and other voluntary or mandated changes in behavior.The outbreak of COVID and actions in response thereto created significant uncertainty and economic volatility and disruption, which have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and have and materially 20Table of Contentsadversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance, including, but not limited to, the following:•We may experience reductions in demand for our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’, suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress, as well as governmental budget constraints. •Some clients have been, and may in the future be, unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner. Further, other third parties, such as suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and other outside business partners, have experienced significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us, or they may be unable to do so in the future altogether.•Many of our employees continue to work remotely. While many of our employees can effectively perform their responsibilities while working remotely, some work may not be completed as efficiently as if it were performed on site. •Various vaccine mandates issued by clients or governments could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, increase costs and administrative burden and make us subject to fines.•Illness, travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, our supply chain, our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects, our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes.•Jurisdictions where we have operations may impose prolonged quarantines or further restrict travel and business activity, which could materially impair our ability to conduct our operations, to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify, pursue and capture new business opportunities.The extent to which COVID or other significant disease outbreaks will impact us depends on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not currently able to predict and may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this 2022 10-K, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us, our business operations, results of operations and financial position.Our actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:•recognition of revenue, costs, profits or losses;•recognition of revenue related to project incentives, awards or other variable consideration we expect to receive;•recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;•estimated amounts for project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;•collectability of receivables and the need and amount of any allowance;•asset valuations;•income tax provisions and related valuation allowances;•determination of expense and potential liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and•accruals for other estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves and receivables.Estimates are based on management's reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results due to changes in facts and circumstances, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. Further, we recognize contract revenue as work on a contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at any point is that percentage of total estimated revenue that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when such estimates are revised. Such adjustments could be material and could result in reduced profitability.21Table of ContentsIf we experience delays or defaults in client payments, we could be negatively impacted.Because of the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from clients in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they come due. Some of our clients have found it difficult to pay our invoices timely, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients for our large projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time, it is difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. In addition, clients may request extension of the payment terms otherwise agreed to under our contracts. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.We have a significant portfolio of government contracts, including those that we have in place with the DOE and U.S. Department of Defense. U.S. government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by government agencies and profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. U.S. government contracts are also subject to uncertainties associated with congressional funding, including the potential impacts of budget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. Changes in U.S. government priorities, which can occur due to policy changes or economic changes, could adversely impact our revenues. The U.S. government is under no obligation to maintain program funding at any specific level, and funds for a program may even be eliminated. Our U.S. government clients may terminate or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice.In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR""), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards (""CAS""), the Service Contract Act and Department of Defense security regulations. Failure to comply with any of these regulations and other government requirements may result in contract price adjustments, financial penalties or contract termination. Our U.S. government contracts are also subject to audits, cost reviews and investigations by U.S. government oversight agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (the ""DCAA""). The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal controls and policies (including our labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems). The DCAA also has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the FAR and CAS. The DCAA presents its findings to the Defense Contract Management Agency (""DCMA""). Should the DCMA determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contract and applicable statutes and regulations, or if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities, payments to us may be disallowed or we could be required to refund previously collected payments. Additionally, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, suspension or debarment from future government contracts, and qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. These suits may remain under seal (and hence, be unknown to us) for some time while the government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. Furthermore, if we have significant disagreements with our government clients concerning costs incurred, negative publicity could arise, which could adversely affect our industry reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts in the government arena or otherwise.Most U.S. government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions that generally require those contractors that have been previously awarded the contract to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under the contract. Such processes require successful contractors to anticipate requirements and develop rapid-response bid and proposal teams as well as dedicated supplier relationships and delivery systems to react to these needs. We face rigorous competition and significant pricing pressures in order to win these task orders. If we are not successful in containing costs or able to timely respond to government requests, we may not win additional awards. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may be impacted in our pursuit of work by government policies designed to protect small businesses and under- represented minority contractors. Many of our U.S. government contracts require security clearances. Depending upon the level of clearance required, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing government clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them.Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, an automatic sequestration process, or across-the-board budget cuts, was triggered when the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan for the U.S. federal budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011 remains in place, extended through 2029, and absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending through 2029. A significant 22Table of Contentsreduction in federal government spending or a change in budgetary priorities could reduce demand for our services, cancel or delay federal projects, and result in the closure of federal facilities and significant personnel reductions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.We are subject to income taxes where we do business. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could change our overall tax rate, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our judgments could prove inaccurate. There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, our ability to realize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. Future changes in our tax rate or adverse changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund our operations in other countries due to tax laws in different jurisdictions. It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.We maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Although we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of our insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their obligations to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could increase and our business operations could be interrupted.If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We provide services to the DOE and the nuclear energy industry in the on-going maintenance and modification of nuclear facilities as well as decontamination and decommissioning activities of nuclear plants. The Price-Anderson Act generally indemnifies parties performing services to nuclear power plants and DOE contractors; however, not all of our activities are covered. Thus, if the Price-Anderson Act indemnification protections do not apply to our services, or if the exposure occurs outside of the U.S. in a region that does not have protections comparable to the Price-Anderson Act, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by our client's refusal to contract with us, by our inability to obtain commercially reasonable insurance or third party indemnification, or by the potentially significant monetary damages we could incur.Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on revenue, earnings and/or backlog.Our contracts may subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project revenue is denominated in a currency different than the expected costs. A project may be denominated in different currencies at various points in time as a project progresses. We may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by implementing hedging strategies utilizing derivatives. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk, and as a result, our profitability could be affected.Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are subject to remeasurement. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly due to foreign currency volatility.The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.A few clients, including the U.S. government, state governments and governmental agencies comprise a significant portion of our revenue. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, fail to renew or terminate their contracts with us at any time. Most of our contracts have ""termination for convenience"" provisions in them. The loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.23Table of ContentsOur business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.Our success is impacted by our ability to differentiate our services through our technologies and know-how. This includes the ability to protect intellectual property rights. We utilize a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our interests. However, these methods only provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our interests. Our employees, contractors and joint venture partners are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights. This can be especially true in certain foreign countries where intellectual property does not have equivalent protections as in the U.S., or when our joint venture partner is a competitor who will gain access to our procedures and know-how while working with us in the performance of services.Our clients require broad ownership rights in the work product and other materials we deliver. If we are unable to retain ownership of our intellectual property and improvements thereto, it may affect our ability to provide similar services to other clients in the future, which ultimately, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Our competitors or others may independently develop technology substantially similar to our trade secret technology or we may be unsuccessful in preserving our intellectual property rights in the future. Our intellectual property rights could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or infringed upon. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention.In addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. There is a risk that we may not sufficiently protect against improper use, access or dissemination and, as a result, we could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on us.We also hold licenses from third parties utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be adversely affected. When we license our intellectual property to third parties, the scope of such license grant is generally limited. If such third party exceeds the scope of the license grant, and if we are unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights, our revenue and margins will be adversely impacted, and the value of our intellectual property portfolio may be adversely affected.Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by impairments. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested at least annually for impairment. Any future impairments, including impairments of tangible assets, goodwill, investments or deferred tax assets, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on us.Climate change related events, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, freezing conditions, and other natural disasters, may have a long-term impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our businesses. For example, a catastrophic natural disaster could negatively impact any of our office locations and the locations of our clients. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is critical to our operations. Accordingly, a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our clients’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages, supply chain disruptions, project delays, financial losses and additional costs to resume operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of cover, legal liability and reputational losses.Further, the risks caused by climate change span across the full spectrum of the industries we serve. The direct physical risks that climate change poses through chronic environmental changes, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, and acute events, such as hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, is common to each of these industries. Our clients could face increased costs to maintain their assets, which could result in reduced profitability and fewer resources for strategic investment. These types of physical risks could in turn lead to transitional risks (i.e., the degree to which society responds to the threat of climate change). For example, growing concerns about climate change may result in activism, protests, legislation, international protocols or treaties, regulation or other restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions or that otherwise seek to address climate change that could affect our clients, including those who (a) are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, such as our Energy Solutions clients, (b) emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or (c) emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such actions could 24Table of Contentsincrease the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on us. However, policy changes and climate legislation could also accelerate energy transition, including the development of carbon capture and storage projects, alternative transportation, alternative energy facilities, such as wind farms or nuclear reactors, or incentivize increased implementation of clean fuels projects, which could positively impact the demand for our services. We cannot predict when or whether any of these legislative proposals may become law or what effect will be on us and our clients.We may also incur additional expenses implementing U.S. and international regulations requiring additional disclosures regarding GHG emissions. Compliance with such regulations and the associated potential costs is complicated by various countries and regions following different approaches to the regulation of climate change.Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors with respect to sustainability practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks. Investors and clients have increasingly focused on the ESG practices of companies, including practices with respect to human capital, emissions and environmental impact and political spending. While we have programs and initiatives in place related to our ESG practices, investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of our practices. In addition, our clients may require that we adhere to varying ESG standards. Our failure to comply with investor or client standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for these issues could also cause reputational harm to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, organizations that provide ratings information to investors on ESG matters may have unfavorable views on us, which may lead to negative sentiment.In addition, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on expectations and assumptions that may not be representative of current or actual risks, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.Risks Related to Indebtedness and other Credit Related RisksAdverse credit and financial market conditions, including increasing interest rates, could impair our clients', our partners' and our own borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect us.Our ability to generate cash is important for the funding of our operations, investing in ventures, the servicing of our indebtedness, paying dividends and making acquisitions. To the extent that existing cash balances and operating cash flow, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing will depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, including those arising due to events occurring in our industry, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; and those factors may affect our efforts to negotiate terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, if global economic, industry, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to establish or draw upon our credit facilities, or refinance borrowings as they mature, may be impacted. In addition, a downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of our borrowings or their refinancing, limit access to sources of financing or lead to other adverse consequences such as requirements for liens or other forms of financial assurance. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In addition, adverse credit and financial market conditions, including increasing interest rates, also adversely affect our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project award and execution delays, payment delays or defaults by our clients. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and profits. If we extend a significant portion of credit to our clients or projects in a specific geographic region or industry, we may experience higher levels of collection risk or non-payment if those clients are impacted by factors specific to their geographic industry or region. Our indebtedness could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;25Table of Contents•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; and•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, challenges and opportunities, and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate.Our ability to service our debt will depend on our future operating performance and financial results, which may be subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial and business conditions. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may need to refinance all or part of our existing debt, borrow more money or sell securities or assets, some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may need to incur additional debt in the future in the ordinary course of business. Although the terms of our credit agreements and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt, there are limitations which may preclude us from incurring the desired amount.Our current debt and any future additional debt we may incur impose, or may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. In addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to accelerate payments due. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, we may need to obtain amendments to our credit agreements or waivers from the lenders to avoid default. These factors could have a material adverse effect on us.We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with financial assurances.It is a common industry practice for clients to require us to provide surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other forms of financial assurance as credit enhancements. Surety bonds, letters of credit or guarantees indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our contractual obligations. Historically, we have had strong surety bonding capacity due to our credit ratings, but bonding is provided at the surety's sole discretion. In addition, because of the overall limitations in worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to access sufficient surety bonding capacity to meet our total surety bonding needs. For letters of credit, we have historically had adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities, but any capacity that may be required in excess of our credit limits would be at our lenders' sole discretion. Failure to provide credit enhancements on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a variety of legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes. Our operating activities expose us to claims against us by clients, subcontractors or suppliers for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We may be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters, including shareholder litigation. During times of economic uncertainty, especially with regard to our commodity-based clients, claim frequencies and amounts tend to increase.In proceedings where it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or these liabilities may exceed our coverage. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposure, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Our professional liability coverage is on a ""claims-made"" basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could have a material adverse impact on us.We have received subpoenas from both the SEC and the DOJ seeking documents and information related to projects for which we recorded charges in the second quarter of 2019 and certain project accounting, financial reporting and governance matters. These matters remain unresolved, and we have continued to cooperate and engage with the SEC and DOJ regarding these investigations. If the SEC or DOJ commences legal action as a result of the investigations, we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions, cease and desist orders and other measures. We cannot predict the outcome or timing of any governmental or regulatory investigation.In addition to these investigations, we have also had numerous securities class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative actions filed against us and certain of our current and former executives and directors.26Table of ContentsWe may incur significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the SEC investigation, the DOJ investigation, lawsuits and related legal and regulatory matters. These expenses and the diversion of our management's attention has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations.We remain exposed to heightened risks of litigation, regulatory proceedings, and government enforcement actions and additional subpoenas. Any future investigations or additional lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on us.In other legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes, we may be covered by indemnification agreements that may at times be difficult to enforce. Even if enforceable, it may be difficult to recover under these agreements if the indemnitor does not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, including for monetary damages. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. Such proceedings can also be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to operations and distracting to management, regardless of the outcome.Our failure to recover adequately on claims against clients, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.We occasionally bring claims against clients for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly provide notice or document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns and in some cases a loss on the project. These types of claims can occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional cost. These claims can result in lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and while unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. However, there is no assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and damaged reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could distract management.We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Our policies mandate strict compliance with U.S. and foreign international trade laws. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the U.S., we are subject to regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of Treasury. From time to time, we identify certain inadvertent or potential export or related violations. These violations may include, for example, transfers without required governmental authorization. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts.27Table of ContentsEmployee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could impair our ability to compete for contractsMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with anti-corruption, export control and environmental regulations; federal procurement regulations, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive government information; regulations on lobbying or similar activities; regulations pertaining to the internal control over financial reporting; and various other applicable laws or regulations. The precautions we take to prevent and detect fraud, misconduct or failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of fraud or misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with government agencies, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits.New or changing legal requirements could adversely affect our operating results.Our business and results of operations could be affected by the passage of laws, policies and regulations. The implementation of trade barriers, countervailing duties, or border taxes, or the addition, relaxation or repeal of laws, policies and regulations regarding the industries and sectors in which we work could result in a decline in demand for our services, or may make the manner in which we perform our services, less profitable. Furthermore, changes to existing trade agreements may impact our business operations. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us and our clients.Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations. Our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, including nuclear and other radioactive materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. It is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations. The applicable regulations, as well as the length of time available to comply with those regulations, continue to develop and change. The cost of complying with regulations, satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we may be found responsible, or satisfying claims or judgments alleging personal injury, property damage or natural resource damages as a result of exposure to, or contamination by, hazardous materials, including as a result of commodities such as lead or asbestos-related products, could be substantial, may not be covered by insurance, could impact profitability and materially impact our operations.We are subject to a number of regulations such as those from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Commission and the European Union, which can have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations and investments. Delays in receiving necessary approvals, permits or licenses, the failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs, and other problems encountered during construction (including changes to such regulatory requirements) could have an adverse effect on us.A substantial portion of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to environmental matters. A reduction in the number or scope of these laws or regulations, or changes in government policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could significantly reduce the size of one of our markets and limit our opportunities for growth or reduce our revenue below current levels.Risks Related to Strategic Plans and Mergers & AcquisitionsWe may be unsuccessful in implementing our strategic and operational initiatives.We have announced a number of strategic and operational initiatives designed to optimize costs and improve operational efficiency, including plans to divest our Stork and equipment businesses, reduce our ownership of NuScale, monetize surplus real estate and non-core investments, and rationalize resources and overhead across various geographies. Our ability to successfully execute these initiatives is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including regulatory intervention, which may negatively impact the realization of expected benefits. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute, competition, economic conditions, and other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on us. Divesting businesses involves risks and uncertainties, such as the difficulty separating assets related to such businesses from the businesses we retain, employee distraction, the need to obtain regulatory approvals and other third-party consents, which potentially disrupts customer and vendor relationships, and the fact that we may be subject 28Table of Contentsto additional tax obligations or loss of certain tax benefits. Such actions also involve significant costs and require time and attention of our management, which may divert attention from other business operations. Because of these challenges, as well as market conditions or other factors, anticipated divestitures may take longer or be costlier or generate fewer benefits than expected and may not be completed at all. If we are unable to complete the divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted. If we dispose of a business, we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or, even if such liabilities are assumed, we may have difficulties enforcing our rights, contractual or otherwise, against the buyer. We may retain exposure on financial or performance guarantees and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations, and potential liabilities that may arise under law because of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer. As a result, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the divestiture of any business could negatively impact our profitability because of losses that may result from such a sale, the loss of revenues or a decrease in cash flows. Following a divestiture, we may also have less diversification in our business and in the markets we serve, as well as in our client base.We may be unsuccessful integrating acquisitions or capitalizing on investments we make.In making an acquisition or investment, we devote significant management attention and resources to integrating or aligning the business practices and operations of companies we acquire or invest in. Difficulties we may encounter in integrating or capitalizing on investments could include:•A delay in the integration or alignment of management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;•Diversion of management's attention;•The consequences of a change in tax treatment;•Differences in corporate culture and management philosophies;•The ability to retain key personnel;•The challenges of integrating or aligning complex IT systems; and•Potential for unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or associated delays, including integration costs.Any of these factors could negatively affect us.Risks Related to our Preferred Stock and our EquityConversion of our CPS will dilute the ownership interest of existing common stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.In May 2021, we issued shares of Series A CPS. The conversion of some or all of the preferred stock into our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing common stockholders. Any public market sales of the common stock issued as a result of conversion could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Our CPS has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect the value of the common stock, our liquidity and our financial condition.Holders of our preferred stock have the right to receive a payment of $1,000 per share, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, upon our liquidation, winding up or dissolution before any payment may be made to holders of our common stock. In addition, dividends on the preferred stock accrue and are cumulative at an annual rate of 6.50%. Subject to certain exceptions, we are not permitted to declare or pay dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid preferred stock dividends have been satisfied. These dividend obligations could impact our liquidity available for other purposes. If dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears and unpaid for six or more quarterly dividend periods, the preferred stockholders are entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors. In addition, votes of holders of at least 66⅔% of the outstanding preferred stock are required to issue any equity senior to the preferred stock.The rights of the preferred stockholders could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferred stockholders could also have divergent interests from the holders of our common stock.29Table of ContentsProvisions attendant to our CPS deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to our stockholders.If a make-whole fundamental change occurs, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for an electing holder. This and other provisions attendant to the preferred stock could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to our common stockholders.If we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.We may in the future issue additional equity securities to pay for potential acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives. If we do issue additional equity securities, the issuance may dilute our earnings per share and stockholders' percentage ownership.Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Fluor is a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:•stockholders may not act by written consent;•there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting or to nominate a director for election; and•our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.These types of provisions in our charters and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our equity holders"
12,FLR,FLUOR CORP,2022-02-22,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We operate in a complex and rapidly changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price could be materially adversely affected.13Table of ContentsSummary Risk Factors
The following summarizes the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and stock price. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.Risks Related to our Operations•COVID has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial position.•We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.•Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on new awards, which are driven by our clients.•The nature of our contracts, particularly our lump-sum contracts, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may not be recoverable and may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on us.•Intense competition in the EPC industry can impact our revenue and profits.•The success of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on us.•Cybersecurity breaches of our systems and information technology could adversely impact us.•We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.•Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments

financial statements.•If we experience delays or defaults in client payments, we could be negatively impacted.•We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.•Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.•Our success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.•Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.•Systems and information technology interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.•It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.•If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.•Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on us.•The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.•Damage to our reputation could in turn cause damage to our business.•Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.•Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.•Climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.•Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors with respect to sustainability practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks.Risks Related to Indebtedness and other Credit Related Risks •Adverse credit and financial market conditions could impair our, our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect us.•Our indebtedness could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.•We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with financial assurances.14Table of ContentsLegal and Regulatory Risks•We are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.•Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.•We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and

business combination that may be favorable to our common stockholders.•In the event we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.•Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Risks Related to our OperationsCOVID has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial position.There have been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities in response to COVID, including vaccine mandates, quarantines, government restrictions on movement, business closures and suspensions, canceled events and activities, isolation, and other voluntary or mandated changes in behavior. Both the outbreak of the disease and actions in response thereto have created significant uncertainty and economic volatility and disruption, which have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance, including, but not limited to, the following:•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, reductions in demand for our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’, suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress, as well as governmental budget constraints. These impacts are expected to continue or worsen if stay-at-home, social distancing, travel restrictions and other similar orders or restrictions remain in place for an extended period of time or are re-imposed after being lifted or eased. •Some clients have been, and may in the future be, unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner, including as a result of deteriorating financial condition. Further, other third parties, such as suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and other outside business partners, have experienced significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us, or they may be unable to do so in the future altogether.•While we have had phased re-openings of some offices in accordance with local guidelines from governing agencies, many of our employees continue to work remotely. While many of our employees can effectively perform their responsibilities while working remotely, some work may not be completed as efficiently as if it were performed on site. Additionally, we may be exposed to unexpected cybersecurity risks and additional information technology-related expenses as a result of these remote working requirements. •We are subject to various vaccine mandates issued by clients or governments, and it is possible that additional mandates may be announced by other jurisdictions that could impact our workforce and operations. Such mandates 15Table of Contentscould negatively impact our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, increase costs and administrative burden and make us subject to fines.•Illness, travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, our supply chain, our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects, our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes.•Jurisdictions where we have operations may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could materially impair our ability to conduct our operations, to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify, pursue and capture new business opportunities, and which could continue to restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces. We also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any current or future government orders or other measures enacted in response to COVID.•We operate in many countries around the world, and certain of those countries’ governments may be unable to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of COVID on their economies and workforces and our operations therein.The extent to which COVID will continue to impact us depends on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not currently able to predict and may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this 2021 10-K, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us, our business operations, results of operations and financial position.We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.The demand for our services is dependent upon the existence of projects with EPC needs. Our clients' interest in approving new projects, budgets for capital expenditures and need for our services have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by, among other things, poor economic conditions, low oil prices, political uncertainties and currency devaluations. Clients have been and remain selective in how they allocate and expend their capital, which has resulted in a reduction of the number of projects we may bid on and win, especially the larger scale projects in which we specialize. For example, in our Energy Solutions segment, capital expenditures by our clients are influenced by factors such as prevailing prices and expectations about future prices for underlying commodities, technological advances, the costs of exploration, production and delivery of product, domestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions and other similar factors. The decline in oil prices in the first quarter of 2020 significantly reduced demand for our services. There is no guarantee that the current recovery in oil prices will be sustained, and the timing and extent of any future improvements in demand remain uncertain. Industries served by that segment and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services.Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on new awards, which are driven by our clients.The awarding and timing of projects is unpredictable and driven by our clients. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors including a client's decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, oil prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid on due to price, a client's perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater risks or include terms and conditions that we might not deem acceptable, especially when the markets for the services we typically offer are relatively soft. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results can fluctuate depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated. Additionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs in recent years, and responsive changes in policy by foreign jurisdictions, have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries.The nature of our contracts, particularly our lump-sum contracts, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may not be recoverable and may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on us.Because our projects are often technically complex, with multiple phases occurring over several years, we incur risks in our project execution activities. These risks could result in project delays, cost overruns or other problems and can include the following:16Table of Contents•Incorrect assumptions related to productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including with respect to the impacts of inflation on lump-sum contracts;•Unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;•Inaccurate representations of site conditions and unanticipated changes in the project execution plan;•Project modifications creating unanticipated costs or delays and failure to properly manage project modifications;•Inability to achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards with regard to engineering, construction or project management obligations;•Insufficient or inadequate project execution tools and systems needed to record, track, forecast and control cost and schedule;•Reliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current economic and/or execution conditions;•Failure to accurately estimate the timing and cost of projects, including due to inflation, supply chain disruption, rising construction costs or unforeseen increases in the cost of labor;•Unanticipated increases in the cost of raw materials, components or equipment, including due to inflation or the imposition of import tariffs;•Failure to properly make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards;•Failure to properly assess and update appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures;•Difficulties related to the performance of our clients, partners, subcontractors, suppliers or other third parties;•Delays or productivity issues caused by weather; and•Changes in local laws or difficulties or delays in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals.These and other risks have in the past and may in the future result in our failure to achieve contractual cost or schedule commitments, safety performance, overall client satisfaction or other performance criteria. As a result, we may receive lower fees or lose our ability to earn incentive fees. In other cases, our fee will not change but we will have to continue to perform work without additional fees until the performance criteria is achieved. We may also be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to complete a project on schedule. In addition, if we fail to meet guaranteed performance or quality standards, we may be held responsible under the guarantee or warranty provisions of our contract for cost impact to the client, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or an obligation to re-perform work. To the extent these events occur, the total cost to the project (including any liquidated damages we become liable to pay) could be material and could, in some circumstances, equal or exceed the full value of the contract. In such events, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and negatively impacted.In circumstances where the contract is lump-sum or the revenue is otherwise fixed, we bear significant risk for delays and cost overruns. Reimbursable contract types, such as those that include negotiated hourly billing rates, may restrict the kinds or amounts of costs that are reimbursable, therefore exposing us to the risk that we may incur certain costs in executing these contracts that are above our estimates and not recoverable from our clients.Intense competition in the EPC industry can impact our revenue and profits.We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These markets require substantial resources and investment in technology and skilled personnel. We also see a continuing influx of non-traditional competitors offering below-market pricing while accepting greater risk. Competition places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and could cause us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk of losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain acceptable profit margins. To the extent we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose revenue and experience reduced profitability.17Table of ContentsThe success of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on us.In the ordinary course of business in our industry, we execute specific projects and otherwise conduct certain operations through joint ventures, consortiums, partnerships and other collaborative arrangements (collectively, ""ventures""). We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with our client; however, services may be performed directly by the venture, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof.Our success in many markets is impacted by the presence or capability of our partners. If we are unable to compete alone, or with a quality partner, our ability to win work and successfully complete our contracts may be impacted. Differences in opinions or views between venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues, which could adversely affect the business and operations of our ventures. In many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement.At times, we also participate in ventures where we are not a controlling party or where we team with unaffiliated parties on a particular project. In such instances, we may have limited control over venture decisions and actions, including internal controls and financial reporting, which may have an impact on our business. If internal control problems arise within a venture, or if our venture partners have financial or operational issues, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The success of our ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. If our venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their obligations, the venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of the contracted services and to meet any performance guarantees. From time to time, in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, we may accept risks or responsibilities for the venture that are not necessarily proportionate with the reward we expect to receive or that may differ from risks or responsibilities we would normally accept in our own operations. We may also be subject to joint and several liability under the contracts for venture projects. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for us with respect to the venture, and in turn, our business and operations. In addition, a failure by a venture partner to comply with applicable regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or, in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Cybersecurity breaches of our systems and information technology could adversely impact our ability to operate.We utilize, develop, install and maintain a number of information technology systems. Various privacy and security laws require us to protect sensitive and confidential information from disclosure. In addition, we are bound by our contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information. Our computer systems, as well as those of our clients, contractors and other vendors, face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hacking, viruses, malicious code, cyber attacks, phishing and other security incursions and system disruptions. While we endeavor to maintain industry-accepted security measures and technology to secure our computer systems and while we endeavor to ensure our cloud vendors that store our data maintain similar measures, these systems and the information stored on these systems are still subject to threats. There can be no assurance that our efforts will protect us against all threats. Further, as these security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to protect, detect and respond against such threats. A party who circumvents our security measures, or those of our clients, contractors or other vendors, could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, improperly manipulate data, or cause damage or interruptions to systems. Any of these events could damage our reputation, result in litigation and regulatory fines and penalties, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance that specifically covers cybersecurity threats, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.Our business is subject to international economic and political conditions that change (sometimes frequently) for reasons that are beyond our control. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future.18Table of ContentsOperating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:•abrupt changes in government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;•embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;•restrictions on currency movement;•tax or tariff changes and withholding requirements;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including logistical and communication challenges;•U.S. government trade or other policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we operate;•other regional, social, political and economic instability, including recessions and other economic crises;•natural disasters and public health crises, including pandemics;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets;•international hostilities; and•unrest, civil strife, acts of war, terrorism and insurrection.Also, the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of the countries where we operate may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights or to defend ourself against claims made by others. We operate in locations where there is a significant amount of political risk. In addition, military action or continued unrest could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere, and increase our security costs. Our level of exposure to these risks may vary with each project, depending on the location of the project and its stage of completion. For example, our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development phase, such as engineering, will generally be less than our risk exposure on a project that is in the construction phase. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions and risks, we may experience project disruptions and losses. Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.Our backlog generally consists of projects for which we have an executed contract or commitment with a client and reflects our expected revenue from the contract or commitment, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable or will not be subject to delay or suspension. Project cancellations, scope adjustments or deferrals, or foreign currency fluctuations may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn; or, may cause the rate at which we perform on our backlog to decrease. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them allowing clients to cancel projects. Our contracts typically provide for the payment of fees earned through the date of termination and the reimbursement of costs incurred including demobilization costs. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. During periods of economic slowdown, or decreases and/or instability in oil prices, the risk of projects being suspended, delayed or canceled generally increases. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and our profits.19Table of ContentsOur employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.We often work on complex projects, frequently in geographically remote or high-risk locations that are subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain safety. In addition, our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment, dangerous processes or substances or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, increasing project costs and raising our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries or loss of life, the completion of a project could be delayed and we could experience investigations or litigation. Although we have a safety function to implement effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability. Despite these activities we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel, nor can we guarantee our work, equipment or supplies will be free from damage.Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, severe weather conditions, public health crises such as COVID, supply chain disruption, political crises or other catastrophic events, could negatively impact our ability to operate or increase our costs to operate. Such events may result in disruptions to our operations; evacuation of personnel; increased labor and material costs or shortages; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such events, unless a contract provision provides us with relief from our obligations. The extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our clients. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are impacted by such an event, our operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients, which may reduce our profits and result in losses.Our actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:•recognition of revenue, costs, profits or losses;•recognition of revenue related to project incentives, awards or other variable consideration we expect to receive;•recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;•estimated amounts for project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;•collectability of receivables and the need and amount of any allowance;•asset valuations;•income tax provisions and related valuation allowances;•determination of expense and potential liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and•accruals for other estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance reserves and receivables.Estimates are based on management's reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results due to changes in facts and circumstances, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. Further, we recognize contract revenue as work on a contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at any point is that percentage of total estimated revenue that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when such estimates are revised. Such adjustments could be material and could result in reduced profitability.20Table of ContentsIf we experience delays or defaults in client payments, we could be negatively impacted.Because of the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from clients in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they come due. Some of our clients have found it difficult to pay our invoices timely, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients for our large projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time, it is difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. In addition, clients may request extension of the payment terms otherwise agreed to under our contracts. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.Some of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified suppliers, our ability to successfully or timely complete a project could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, technology, equipment or services as required under a contract to us, our joint venture partner, our client or any other party involved in the project for any reason, or provides supplies, technology, equipment or services that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies, technology, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact our profitability. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. These risks may be intensified during an economic downturn if these suppliers or subcontractors experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the services or supplies necessary for our business. In addition, in instances where we rely on a limited number of suppliers or subcontractors, there may be no available replacement technology, equipment, materials or services on a timely basis or at the costs we had anticipated. A failure by a third-party subcontractor or supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension, or in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.We have a significant portfolio of government contracts, including those that we have in place with the DOE and U.S. Department of Defense. U.S. government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by government agencies and profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. U.S. government contracts are also subject to uncertainties associated with congressional funding, including the potential impacts of budget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. Changes in U.S. government priorities, which can occur due to policy changes or economic changes, could adversely impact our revenues. The U.S. government is under no obligation to maintain program funding at any specific level, and funds for a program may even be eliminated. Our U.S. government clients may terminate or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice.In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR""), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards (""CAS""), the Service Contract Act and Department of Defense security regulations. Failure to comply with any of these regulations and other government requirements may result in contract price adjustments, financial penalties or contract termination. Our U.S. government contracts are also subject to audits, cost reviews and investigations by U.S. government oversight agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (the ""DCAA""). The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal controls and policies (including our labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems). The DCAA also has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the FAR and CAS. The DCAA presents its findings to the Defense Contract Management Agency (""DCMA""). Should the DCMA determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contract and applicable statutes and regulations, or if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities, payments to us may be disallowed or we could be required to refund previously collected payments. Additionally, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, suspension or debarment from future government contracts, and qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. These suits may remain under seal (and hence, be unknown to us) for some time while the government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. Furthermore, if we have significant disagreements with our government clients concerning costs incurred, negative publicity could arise, which could adversely affect our industry reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts in the government arena or otherwise.21Table of ContentsMost U.S. government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions that generally require those contractors that have been previously awarded the contract to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under the contract. Such processes require successful contractors to anticipate requirements and develop rapid-response bid and proposal teams as well as dedicated supplier relationships and delivery systems to react to these needs. We face rigorous competition and significant pricing pressures in order to win these task orders. If we are not successful in containing costs or able to timely respond to government requests, we may not win additional awards. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may be impacted in our pursuit of work by government policies designed to protect small businesses and under- represented minority contractors. Many of our U.S. government contracts require security clearances. Depending upon the level of clearance required, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing government clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them.Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, an automatic sequestration process, or across-the-board budget cuts, was triggered when the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan for the U.S. federal budget. The Budget Control Act of 2011 remains in place, extended through 2029, and absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending through 2029. A significant reduction in federal government spending or a change in budgetary priorities could reduce demand for our services, cancel or delay federal projects, and result in the closure of federal facilities and significant personnel reductions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.The success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract, develop and retain personnel, including engineers, project management, craft employees and management around the globe, who have the necessary and required experience and expertise, and who will perform these services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense. It may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may be unable to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to deploy qualified personnel. Also, it may be difficult to replace personnel who hold government required credentials. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects.As some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age or otherwise leave the company, we need to provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify and integrate new personnel into leadership roles. Changes in our management team may disrupt our business and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate executives or other key personnel could adversely affect our results. If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected, the costs of executing our existing and future projects may increase.In addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with project needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on us.Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.We are subject to income taxes where we do business. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could change our overall tax rate , which could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our judgments could prove inaccurate. There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, our ability to realize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. Future changes in our tax rate or adverse changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.22Table of ContentsSystems and information technology interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.We are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays that may be planned for upgrades or that may be unplanned. Unplanned interruptions could result from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays, loss of critical or sensitive data (including personal or financial data) or loss of funds; could delay or prevent operations (including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results); and could adversely affect our reputation or our operating results. While we have and require the maintenance of reasonable safeguards designed to protect against unavailability or loss of data, these safeguards may not be sufficient. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flows.We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. Our systems implementations also may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business.It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.We maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Although we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of our insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their obligations to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could increase and our business operations could be interrupted.If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We provide services to the DOE and the nuclear energy industry in the on-going maintenance and modification of nuclear facilities as well as decontamination and decommissioning activities of nuclear plants. The Price-Anderson Act generally indemnifies parties performing services to nuclear power plants and DOE contractors; however, not all of our activities are covered. Thus, if the Price-Anderson Act indemnification protections do not apply to our services, or if the exposure occurs outside of the U.S. in a region that does not have protections comparable to the Price-Anderson Act, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by our client's refusal to contract with us, by our inability to obtain commercially reasonable insurance or third party indemnification, or by the potentially significant monetary damages we could incur.Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on revenue, earnings and/or backlog.Our contracts may subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project revenue is denominated in a currency different than the expected costs. A project may be denominated in different currencies at various points in time as a project progresses. We may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by implementing hedging strategies utilizing derivatives. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk, and as a result, our profitability could be affected.Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are subject to remeasurement. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly due to foreign currency volatility. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund our operations in other countries.The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.A few clients, including the U.S. government, state governments and governmental agencies comprise a significant portion of our revenue. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may 23Table of Contentsunilaterally reduce, fail to renew or terminate their contracts with us at any time. Most of our contracts have ""termination for convenience"" provisions in them. The loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Damage to our reputation could in turn cause damage to our business.Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients and other business relationships. If we fail to address issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business. These issues may include, but are not limited to, any of the risk factors discussed herein. If our reputation is harmed, we could suffer a number of adverse consequences, such as:•reduced demand for our services;•lack of investor confidence;•less favorable credit rating;•the inability to attract and retain qualified employees;•a loss or reduction in scope of current project contracts and fewer contract awards;•less favorable contract terms;•increased need for financial assurances;•increased litigation and costs; and•heightened regulatory scrutiny.These and other consequences resulting from damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect us.Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.Our success is impacted by our ability to differentiate our services through our technologies and know-how. This includes the ability to protect intellectual property rights. We utilize a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our interests. However, these methods only provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our interests. Our employees, contractors and joint venture partners are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights. This can be especially true in certain foreign countries where intellectual property does not have equivalent protections as in the U.S., or when our joint venture partner is a competitor who will gain access to our procedures and know-how while working with us in the performance of services.Our clients require broad ownership rights in the work product and other materials we deliver. If we are unable to retain ownership of our pre-existing intellectual property and improvements thereto, it may affect our ability to provide similar services to other clients in the future, which ultimately, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Our competitors or others may independently develop technology substantially similar to our trade secret technology or we may be unsuccessful in preserving our intellectual property rights in the future. Our intellectual property rights could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or infringed upon. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention.In addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. There is a risk that we may not sufficiently protect against improper use or dissemination and, as a result, we could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on us.We also hold licenses from third parties utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, we could be adversely affected. When we license our intellectual property to third parties, the scope of such license grant is generally limited. If such third party exceeds the scope of the license grant, and if we are unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights, our revenue and margins will be adversely impacted, and the value of our intellectual property portfolio may be adversely affected.24Table of ContentsOur results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by impairments. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested at least annually for impairment. Any future impairments, including impairments of tangible assets, goodwill, investments, deferred tax assets or other intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Climate change and related environmental issues could have a material adverse impact on us.Climate change related events, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, freezing conditions, and other natural disasters, may have a long-term impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks regardless of where we conduct our businesses. For example, a catastrophic natural disaster could negatively impact any of our office locations and the locations of our clients. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business is critical to our operations. Accordingly, a natural disaster has the potential to disrupt our and our clients’ businesses and may cause us to experience work stoppages, supply chain disruptions, project delays, financial losses and additional costs to resume operations, including increased insurance costs or loss of cover, legal liability and reputational losses.Further, the risks caused by climate change span across the full spectrum of the industries we serve. The direct physical risks that climate change poses through chronic environmental changes, such as rising sea levels and temperatures, and acute events, such as hurricanes, droughts and wildfires, is common to each of these industries. Our clients could face increased costs to maintain their assets, which could result in reduced profitability and fewer resources for strategic investment. These types of physical risks could in turn lead to transitional risks (i.e., the degree to which society responds to the threat of climate change). For example, growing concerns about climate change may result in legislation, international protocols or treaties, regulation or other restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions or that otherwise seek to address climate change that could affect our clients, including those who (a) are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels, such as our Energy Solutions clients, (b) emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels or (c) emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which would in turn have a material adverse impact on us. However, policy changes and climate legislation could also accelerate energy transition, including the development of carbon capture and storage projects, alternative transportation, alternative energy facilities, such as wind farms or nuclear reactors, or incentivize increased implementation of clean fuels projects, which could positively impact the demand for our services. We cannot predict when or whether any of these legislative proposals may become law or what effect will be on us and our clients.Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from investors with respect to sustainability practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to reputational or other risks. Investors and clients have increasingly focused on the environmental, social and governance practices of companies, including practices with respect to human capital, emissions and environmental impact and political spending. While we have programs and initiatives in place related to our environmental, social and governance practices, investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of our practices. In addition, our clients may require that we adhere to varying environmental, social or governance standards. Our failure to comply with investor or client standards, which are evolving, or if we are perceived to not have responded appropriately to the growing concern for these issues could also cause reputational harm to our business and could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, organizations that provide ratings information to investors on environmental, social and governance matters may have unfavorable views on us, which may lead to negative sentiment.Risks Related to IndebtednessAdverse credit and financial market conditions could impair our, our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect us.Our ability to generate cash is important for the funding of our operations, investing in ventures, the servicing of our indebtedness, paying dividends and making acquisitions. To the extent that existing cash balances and operating cash flow, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing will depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, including those arising due to events occurring in our industry, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; and those factors may affect our efforts to negotiate terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, if global economic, industry, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to establish or draw upon our credit 25Table of Contentsfacilities may be impacted. In addition, a downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of our borrowings or their refinancing, limit access to sources of financing or lead to other adverse consequences. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In addition, adverse credit and financial market conditions also adversely affect our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project award and execution delays, payment delays or defaults by our clients. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and profits. If we extend a significant portion of credit to our clients or projects in a specific geographic region or industry, we may experience higher levels of collection risk or non-payment if those clients are impacted by factors specific to their geographic industry or region. Our indebtedness could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to servicing our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes; and•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, challenges and opportunities, and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate.Our ability to service our debt will depend on our future operating performance and financial results, which may be subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial and business conditions. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our debt, we may need to refinance all or part of our existing debt, borrow more money or sell securities or assets, some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may need to incur additional debt in the future in the ordinary course of business. Although the terms of our credit agreements and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt, there are limitations which may preclude us from incurring the desired amount.Our current debt and any future additional debt we may incur impose, or may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. In addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to accelerate payments due. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, we may need to obtain amendments to our credit agreements or waivers from the lenders to avoid default. These factors could have a material adverse effect on us.We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with financial assurances.It is a common industry practice for clients to require us to provide surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other forms of financial assurance as credit enhancements. Surety bonds, letters of credit or guarantees indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our contractual obligations. Historically, we have had strong surety bonding capacity due to our credit rating, but bonding is provided at the surety's sole discretion. In addition, because of the overall limitations in worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to access sufficient surety bonding capacity to meet our total surety bonding needs. For letters of credit, we have historically had adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities, but any capacity that may be required in excess of our credit limits would be at our lenders' sole discretion. Failure to provide credit enhancements on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to a variety of legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes. Our operating activities expose us to claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We may be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters, including shareholder litigation. During times of economic uncertainty, especially with regard to our commodity-based clients, claim frequencies and amounts tend to increase.26Table of ContentsIn proceedings where it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or  these liabilities may exceed our coverage. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposure, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Our professional liability coverage is on a ""claims-made"" basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could have a material adverse impact on us.We have received subpoenas from both the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") seeking documents and information related to projects for which we recorded charges in the second quarter of 2019 and certain project accounting, financial reporting and governance matters. We are coordinating our responses to the SEC and DOJ and cooperating in providing the requested documents and information. If the SEC or DOJ commences legal action as a result of the investigations, we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions, cease and desist orders and other measures. We cannot predict the outcome or timing of any governmental or regulatory investigation.In addition to these investigations, we have also had numerous securities class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative actions filed against us and certain of our current and former executives and directors.We may incur significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the SEC investigation, the DOJ investigation, lawsuits and related legal and regulatory matters. These expenses and the diversion of our management's attention has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations.We remain exposed to heightened risks of litigation, regulatory proceedings, and government enforcement actions and additional subpoenas. Any future investigations or additional lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on us.In other legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes, we may be covered by indemnification agreements that may at times be difficult to enforce. Even if enforceable, it may be difficult to recover under these agreements if the indemnitor does not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, including for monetary damages. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. Such proceedings can also be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to operations and distracting to management, regardless of the outcome.Our failure to recover adequately on claims against clients, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.We occasionally bring claims against clients for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly provide notice or document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns and in some cases a loss on the project. These types of claims can occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional cost. These claims can result in lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and while unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. However, there is no assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and damaged reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could distract management.27Table of ContentsWe could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Our policies mandate strict compliance with U.S. and foreign international trade laws. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the U.S., we are subject to regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of Treasury. From time to time, we identify certain inadvertent or potential export or related violations. These violations may include, for example, transfers without required governmental authorization. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts.Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could impair our ability to compete for contractsMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with anti-corruption, export control and environmental regulations; federal procurement regulations, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive government information; regulations on lobbying or similar activities; regulations pertaining to the internal control over financial reporting; and various other applicable laws or regulations. The precautions we take to prevent and detect fraud, misconduct or failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of fraud or misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with government agencies, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits.New or changing legal requirements could adversely affect our operating results.Our business and results of operations could be affected by the passage of laws, policies and regulations. The implementation of trade barriers, countervailing duties, or border taxes, or the addition, relaxation or repeal of laws, policies and regulations regarding the industries and sectors in which we work could result in a decline in demand for our services, or may make the manner in which we perform our services, less profitable. Furthermore, changes to existing trade agreements may impact our business operations. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us and our clients.Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations. Our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, including nuclear and other radioactive materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. It is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations. The applicable regulations, as well as the length of time available to comply with those regulations, continue to develop and change. The cost of complying with regulations, satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we may be found responsible, or satisfying claims or judgments alleging personal injury, property damage or natural resource damages as a result of exposure to, or contamination by, hazardous materials, including as a result of commodities such as lead or asbestos-related products, could be substantial, may not be covered by insurance, could impact profitability and materially impact our operations.We are subject to a number of regulations such as those from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Commission and the European Union, which can have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations and investments. Delays in receiving necessary approvals, permits or licenses, the failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs, and other problems encountered during construction (including changes to such regulatory requirements) could have an adverse effect on us.A substantial portion of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to environmental matters. A reduction in the number or scope of these laws or regulations, or changes in government policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could significantly reduce the size of one of our markets and limit our opportunities for growth or reduce our revenue below current levels.28Table of ContentsRisks Related to Mergers & Acquisitions and Strategic PlansWe may be unsuccessful in implementing our strategic and operational initiatives.We have announced a number of strategic and operational initiatives designed to optimize costs and improve operational efficiency, including plans to divest our Stork business, monetize surplus real estate and non-core investments, and rationalize resources and overhead across various geographies. Our ability to successfully execute these initiatives is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including regulatory intervention, which may negatively impact the realization of expected benefits. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute, competition, economic conditions, and other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on us. Divesting businesses involves risks and uncertainties, such as the difficulty separating assets related to such businesses from the businesses we retain, employee distraction, the need to obtain regulatory approvals and other third-party consents, which potentially disrupts customer and vendor relationships, and the fact that we may be subject to additional tax obligations or loss of certain tax benefits. Such actions also involve significant costs and require time and attention of our management, which may divert attention from other business operations. Because of these challenges, as well as market conditions or other factors, anticipated divestitures may take longer or be costlier or generate fewer benefits than expected and may not be completed at all. If we are unable to complete the divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted. If we dispose of a business, we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or, even if such liabilities are assumed, we may have difficulties enforcing our rights, contractual or otherwise, against the buyer. We may retain exposure on financial or performance guarantees and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations, and potential liabilities that may arise under law because of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer. As a result, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the divestiture of any business could negatively impact our profitability because of losses that may result from such a sale, the loss of revenues or a decrease in cash flows. Following a divestiture, we may also have less diversification in our business and in the markets we serve, as well as in our client base.We may be unsuccessful integrating acquisitions or capitalizing on investments we make.In making an acquisition or investment, we devote significant management attention and resources to integrating or aligning the business practices and operations of companies we acquire or invest in. Difficulties we may encounter in integrating or capitalizing on investments could include:•A delay in the integration or alignment of management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;•Diversion of management's attention;•The consequences of a change in tax treatment;•Differences in corporate culture and management philosophies;•The ability to retain key personnel;•The challenges of integrating or aligning complex IT systems; and•Potential for unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or associated delays, including integration costs.Any of these factors could negatively affect us.Risks Related to our Preferred Stock and our EquityConversion of our CPS will dilute the ownership interest of existing common stockholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock.In May 2021, we issued shares of Series A CPS. The conversion of some or all of the preferred stock into our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing common stockholders. Any public market sales of the common stock issuable upon conversion could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.Our CPS has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, our common stockholders, which could adversely affect the value of the common stock, our liquidity and our financial condition.Holders of our preferred stock have the right to receive a payment of $1,000 per share, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends, upon our liquidation, winding up or dissolution before any payment may be made to holders of our common stock. 29Table of ContentsIn addition, dividends on the preferred stock accrue and are cumulative at an annual rate of 6.50%. Subject to certain exceptions, we are not permitted to declare or pay dividends on our common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid preferred stock dividends have been satisfied. These dividend obligations could impact our liquidity available for other purposes. If dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears and unpaid for six or more quarterly dividend periods, the preferred stockholders are entitled to elect two additional directors to our board of directors. In addition, votes of holders of at least 66⅔% of the outstanding preferred stock are required to issue any equity senior to the preferred stock.The rights of the preferred stockholders could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferred stockholders could also have divergent interests from the holders of our common stock.Provisions attendant to our preferred stock may deter or prevent a business combination that may be favorable to our stockholders.If a make-whole fundamental change occurs, we may be required to increase the conversion rate for an electing holder. This and other provisions attendant to the preferred stock could deter or prevent a third party from acquiring us even when the acquisition may be favorable to our common stockholders.In the event we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.We may in the future issue additional equity securities to pay for potential acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives. If we do issue additional equity securities, the issuance may dilute our earnings per share and stockholders' percentage ownership.Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Fluor is a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:•stockholders may not act by written consent;•there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting or to nominate a director for election; and•our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.These types of provisions in our charters and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our equity holders"
16,FLR,FLUOR CORP,2021-02-26,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We operate in a complex and rapidly changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price could be materially adversely affected.Summary Risk Factors
The following summarizes the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and stock price. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.Risks Related to our Operations•COVID-19 has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial position.•We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.•Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on the award of new contracts, which is driven by our clients.•The nature of our contracts, particularly our lump-sum contracts, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may not be recoverable and may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.•Intense competition in the global EPC industry can reduce our revenue and profits.•The success of our use of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.•Cybersecurity breaches of our systems and information technology could adversely impact our ability to operate.•We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.•Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.13Table of Contents•Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.•Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.•Our actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.•If we experience delays and/or defaults in client payments, we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures.•We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.•Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.•Our continued success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.•Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.•Systems and information technology interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.•It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.•If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.•Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on revenue, earnings and/or backlog.•The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.•Damage to our reputation could in turn cause damage to our business.•Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.•Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.Risks Related to Financial Reporting•We identified material weaknesses in our ICFR in 2019, which were remediated in 2020. If we identify material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.•Our prior failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital and restricts our ability to issue equity securities.•We restated certain of our previously issued financial statements during 2020, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues.Risks Related to Indebtedness and other Credit Related Risks •Adverse credit and financial market conditions could impair our, our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect our business operations, profits and growth objectives.•Our indebtedness could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.•We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with letters of credit, bonds or other security or credit enhancements.Legal and Regulatory Risks•From time to time, we are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.•Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.•We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.•We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.•Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.•New or changing legal requirements, including those relating to climate change, could adversely affect our operating results.•Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits.14Table of ContentsRisks Related to Mergers & Acquisitions and Strategic Plans•We cannot assure the successful implementation of our strategic and operational initiatives.•Any acquisitions, dispositions or other investments are subject to various risks or uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated time frame, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.•We may be unable to successfully integrate acquisitions or investments we make into our businesses or capture the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and investments.Risks Related to our Common Stock •In the event we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.•Delaware law, our charter documents and our stockholder rights agreement may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Risks Related to our OperationsCOVID-19 has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial position.There have been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities in response to COVID-19, including quarantines, government restrictions on movement, business closures and suspensions, canceled events and activities, self-isolation, and other voluntary or mandated changes in behavior. Both the outbreak of the disease and actions in response thereto have created significant uncertainty and economic volatility and disruption, which have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations and have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance, including, but not limited to, the following:•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, reductions in demand for certain of our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’, suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress, as well as governmental budget constraints. These impacts are expected to continue or worsen if stay-at-home, social distancing, travel restrictions and other similar orders or restrictions remain in place for an extended period of time or are re-imposed after being lifted or eased. •Some clients have been, and may in the future be, unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner, including as a result of deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy. Further, other third parties, such as suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and other outside business partners, have experienced significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us, or they may be unable to do so in the future altogether.•Many employers, including us, and governments continue to require all or a significant portion of employees to work remotely. While many of our employees can effectively perform their responsibilities while working remotely, some work may not be completed as efficiently as if it were performed on site. Additionally, we may be exposed to unexpected cybersecurity risks and additional information technology-related expenses as a result of these remote working requirements. •Illness, travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, our supply chain, our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects, our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes.•We have furloughed certain employees and may need to further furlough or reduce the number of employees that we employ. We may experience difficulties associated with hiring additional employees or replacing employees, in particular with respect to roles that require security clearances or other special qualifications that may be limited or difficult to obtain. •In addition to existing travel restrictions implemented in response to COVID-19, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could materially impair our ability to conduct our operations, to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify, pursue and capture new business opportunities, and which could continue to restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces. We also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any future government orders or other measures enacted in response to COVID-19.15Table of Contents•We operate in many countries around the world, and certain of those countries’ governments may be unable to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of COVID-19 on their economies and workforces and our operations therein.The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to impact us depends on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not currently able to predict and may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this 2020 10-K, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us, our business operations, results of operations and financial position.We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.The demand for our services is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, maintenance and management needs. Our clients' interest in approving new projects, budgets for capital expenditures and need for our services have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by, among other things, poor economic conditions, low oil prices, political uncertainties and currency devaluations. Clients have been and remain selective in how they allocate and expend their capital, which has resulted in a reduction of the number of projects we may bid on and win, especially the larger scale projects in which we specialize. For example, in our Energy & Chemicals segment, capital expenditures by our clients are influenced by factors such as prevailing prices and expectations about future prices for underlying commodities, technological advances, the costs of exploration, production and delivery of product, domestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions and other similar factors. As a result of the decline in oil prices in the first quarter of 2020, demand for our services in our Energy & Chemicals segment has been adversely impacted. There is no guarantee that the current recovery in oil prices will be sustained, and the timing and extent of any future improvements in demand remain uncertain. Industries served by that segment and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services.Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on the award of new contracts, which is driven by our clients.The awarding and timing of projects is unpredictable and driven by our clients. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors including a client's decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, oil prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid on due to price, a client's perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or include terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem acceptable, especially when the markets for the services we typically offer are relatively soft. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results of operations can fluctuate depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated. Additionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, recent changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries.The nature of our contracts, particularly our lump-sum contracts, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may not be recoverable and may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.Because our projects are often technically complex, with multiple phases occurring over several years, we incur risks in our project execution activities. These risks could result in project delays, cost overruns or other problems and can include the following:•Incorrect assumptions related to productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including with respect to the impacts of inflation on lump-sum contracts;•Unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;•Inaccurate representations of site conditions and unanticipated changes in the project execution plan;•Project modifications creating unanticipated costs or delays and failure to properly manage project modifications;•Inability to achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards with regard to engineering, construction or project management obligations;16Table of Contents•Insufficient or inadequate project execution tools and systems needed to record, track, forecast and control cost and schedule;•Reliance on historic cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current economic and/or execution conditions;•Failure to accurately estimate the timing and cost of projects, including due to unforeseen increases in the cost of labor;•Unanticipated increases in the cost of raw materials, components or equipment, including due to the imposition of import tariffs;•Failure to properly make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards;•Failure to properly assess and update appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures;•Difficulties related to the performance of our clients, partners, subcontractors, suppliers or other third parties;•Delays or productivity issues caused by weather; and•Changes in local laws or difficulties or delays in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals.These and other risks have in the past and may in the future result in our failure to achieve contractual cost or schedule commitments, safety performance, overall client satisfaction or other performance criteria. As a result, we may receive lower fees or lose our ability to earn incentive fees. In other cases, our fee will not change but we will have to continue to perform work without additional fees until the performance criteria is achieved. We may also be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to complete a project on schedule. In addition, if we fail to meet guaranteed performance or quality standards, we may be held responsible under the guarantee or warranty provisions of our contract for cost impact to the client, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or an obligation to re-perform work. To the extent these events occur, the total cost to the project (including any liquidated damages we become liable to pay) could be material and could, in some circumstances, equal or exceed the full value of the contract. In such events, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and negatively impacted.In circumstances where the contract is lump-sum or the revenue is otherwise fixed, we bear significant risk for delays and cost overruns. Reimbursable contract types, such as those that include negotiated hourly billing rates, may restrict the kinds or amounts of costs that are reimbursable, therefore exposing us to the risk that we may incur certain costs in executing these contracts that are above our estimates and not recoverable from our clients.Intense competition in the global EPC industry can reduce our revenue and profits.We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These markets require substantial resources and investment in technology and skilled personnel. We also see a continuing influx of non-traditional competitors offering below-market pricing while accepting greater risk. Competition places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and has in the past forced, and may in the future force, us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk of losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. To the extent we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose revenue and experience an overall reduction in our profits.The success of our use of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.In the ordinary course of business, and as has become increasingly common in our industry, we execute specific projects and otherwise conduct certain operations through joint ventures, consortiums, partnerships and other collaborative arrangements (collectively, ""ventures""). We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with the third party client; however, services may be performed directly by the venture, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof.Our success in many markets is dependent, in part, on the presence or capability of a local partner. If we are unable to compete alone, or with a quality partner, our ability to win work and successfully complete our contracts may be impacted. 17Table of ContentsDifferences in opinions or views between venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues, which could adversely affect the business and operations of our ventures. In many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement.At times, we also participate in ventures where we are not a controlling party or where we team with unaffiliated parties on a particular project bid. In such instances, we may have limited control over venture decisions and actions, including internal controls and financial reporting, which may have an impact on our business. If internal control problems arise within the joint venture, or if our joint venture partners have financial or operational issues, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The success of these and other ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their venture obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. If our venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their venture obligations, the venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery by the venture of the contracted services and to meet any performance guarantees. From time to time, in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, we may accept risks or responsibilities for the venture that are not necessarily proportionate with the reward we expect to receive or that may differ from risks or responsibilities we would normally accept in our own operations. We may also be subject to joint and several liability for our venture partners under the applicable contracts for venture projects. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for us with respect to the venture, and in turn, our business and operations. In addition, a failure by a venture partner to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or, in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Cybersecurity breaches of our systems and information technology could adversely impact our ability to operate.We utilize, develop, install and maintain a number of information technology systems both for us and for others. Various privacy and security laws require us to protect sensitive and confidential information from disclosure. In addition, we are bound by our client and other contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information (whether it be ours or a third party's information entrusted to us) from disclosure. Our computer systems, as well as those of our clients, contractors and other vendors, face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, viruses, malicious code, cyber attacks, phishing and other security incursions and system disruptions, including attempts to improperly access our confidential and proprietary information as well as the confidential and proprietary information of our clients and other business partners. While we endeavor to maintain industry-accepted security measures and technology to secure our computer systems and while we endeavor to ensure our cloud vendors that store our data maintain similar measures, these systems and the information stored on these systems may still be subject to threats. There can be no assurance that our efforts will protect us against all threats. Further, as these security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to protect, detect and respond against such threats. A party who circumvents our security measures, or those of our clients, contractors or other vendors, could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, improperly manipulate data, or cause damage or interruptions to systems. Any of these events could damage our reputation, result in litigation and regulatory fines and penalties, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance that specifically covers cybersecurity threats, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.Our business is subject to international economic and political conditions that change (sometimes frequently) for reasons that are beyond our control. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future.Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:•abrupt changes in government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;•embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;•restrictions on currency movement;•tax or tariff changes;18Table of Contents•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including logistical and communication challenges;•U.S. government trade or other policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we or our clients operate;•other social, political and economic instability, including recessions and other economic crises in other regions;•natural disasters and public health crises, including pandemics such as COVID-19;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country;•international hostilities; and•unrest, civil strife, acts of war, terrorism and insurrection.Also, the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of the countries where we operate may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights or to defend ourself against claims made by others. We operate in locations where there is a significant amount of political risk. In addition, military action or continued unrest could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere, and increase our security costs. Our level of exposure to these risks may vary with each project, depending on the location of the project and its stage of completion. For example, our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development phase, such as engineering, will generally be less than our risk exposure on a project that is in the construction phase. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions and risks, we may experience project disruptions and losses. Project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our overall revenue and profits.Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations.Our backlog generally consists of projects for which we have an executed contract or commitment with a client and reflects our expected revenue from the contract or commitment, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable or will not be subject to delay or suspension. Project cancellations, scope adjustments or deferrals, or foreign currency fluctuations may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn; or, may cause the rate at which we perform on our backlog to decrease. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them allowing clients to cancel projects already awarded to us. Our contracts typically provide for the payment of fees earned through the date of termination and the reimbursement of costs incurred including demobilization costs. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. During periods of economic slowdown, or decreases and/or instability in oil prices, the risk of projects being suspended, delayed or canceled generally increases. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and our profits.Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.We often work on complex projects, frequently in geographically remote or high-risk locations that are subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. In addition, our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment, dangerous processes or substances or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, increasing project costs and raising our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries or even loss of life, the completion of a project could be delayed and we could experience investigations or litigation. Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability. Despite these activities, in these locations and at these sites, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel, nor can we guarantee our work, equipment or supplies will be free from damage.19Table of ContentsOur businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, severe weather conditions, public health crises, political crises or other catastrophic events, could negatively impact our ability to operate or increase our costs to operate. Such events may result in disruptions to our operations; evacuation of personnel; increased labor and material costs or shortages; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such events, unless a contract provision provides us with relief from our obligations. The extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our clients. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are impacted by such an event, our operations may be adversely affected. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients, which may reduce our profits and result in losses.Our actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.In preparing our financial statements, we make estimates and assumptions through the filing date of the 2020 10-K. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:•recognition of contract revenue, costs, profits or losses in applying the principles of percentage-of-completion accounting;•recognition of revenues related to project incentives or awards we expect to receive;•recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;•estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;•collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts;•asset valuations;•income tax provisions and related valuation allowances;•determination of expense and potential liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and•accruals for other estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves.Estimates are based on management's reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results due to changes in facts and circumstances, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. Further, we recognize contract revenue as work on a contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at any point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenues that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when such estimates are revised. Such adjustments could be material and could result in reduced profitability.If we experience delays and/or defaults in client payments, we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures.Because of the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from clients in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred. Some of our clients have found it difficult to pay invoices for our services timely, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients for our large projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time, it has been and may in the future be difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. In addition, clients may request extension of the payment terms otherwise agreed to under our contracts. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.Some of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified 20Table of Contentssubcontractors or find qualified suppliers, our ability to successfully or timely complete a project could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump-sum contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, technology, equipment or services as required under a contract to us, our joint venture partner, our client or any other party involved in the project for any reason, or provides supplies, technology, equipment or services that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies, technology, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact contract profitability. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. These risks may be intensified during an economic downturn if these suppliers or subcontractors experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the services or supplies necessary for our business. In addition, in instances where we rely on a single contracted supplier or subcontractor or a small number of suppliers or subcontractors, if a subcontractor or supplier were to fail, there may be no available replacement technology, equipment, materials or services on a timely basis or at the costs we had anticipated. A failure by a third-party subcontractor or supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension, or in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.We enter into significant government contracts, including those contracts that we have in place with the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Defense. U.S. government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by government agencies and profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. U.S. government contracts are also subject to uncertainties associated with Congressional funding, including the potential impacts of budget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. Changes in U.S. government priorities, which can occur due to policy changes or changes in the economy, could adversely impact our revenues. The U.S. government is under no obligation to maintain program funding at any specific level, and funds for a program may even be eliminated. Our U.S. government clients may terminate or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice.In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR""), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards (""CAS""), the Service Contract Act and Department of Defense security regulations. Failure to comply with any of these regulations and other government requirements may result in contract price adjustments, financial penalties or contract termination. Our U.S. government contracts are also subject to audits, cost reviews and investigations by U.S. government oversight agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (the ""DCAA""). The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies (including our labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems). The DCAA also has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the FAR and CAS. The DCAA presents its report findings to the Defense Contract Management Agency (""DCMA""). Should the DCMA determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contract and applicable statutes and regulations, or if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities, payments to us may be disallowed or we could be required to refund previously collected payments. Additionally, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, suspension or debarment from future government contracts, and qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. These suits may remain under seal (and hence, be unknown to us) for some time while the government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. Furthermore, if we have significant disagreements with our government clients concerning costs incurred, negative publicity could arise, which could adversely affect our industry reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts in the government arena or otherwise.Most U.S. government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions that generally require those contractors that have been previously awarded the contract to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under the contract. Such processes require successful contractors to anticipate requirements and develop rapid-response bid and proposal teams as well as dedicated supplier relationships and delivery systems to react to these needs. We face rigorous competition and significant pricing pressures in order to win these task orders. If we are not successful in containing costs or able to timely respond to government requests, we may not win additional awards. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may be impacted in our pursuit of work by government policies designed to protect small businesses and under- represented minority contractors. Many of our U.S. government contracts require security clearances. Depending upon the level of clearance required, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain 21Table of Contentsnecessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing government clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them.Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, an automatic sequestration process, or across-the-board budget cuts, was triggered when the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, a committee of twelve members of Congress, failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan for the U.S. federal budget. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (the “BBA”) eliminates sequestration on discretionary accounts in 2020 and 2021 by increasing federal discretionary spending limits until 2021. The BBA also temporarily suspends the public debt limit through July 31, 2021. However, the Budget Control Act of 2011 remains in place, extended through 2029, and absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending from 2022 through 2029. A significant reduction in federal government spending or a change in budgetary priorities could reduce demand for our services, cancel or delay federal projects, and result in the closure of federal facilities and significant personnel reductions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our continued success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.The success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract, develop and retain personnel, including engineers, project management, craft employees and management around the globe, who have the necessary and required experience and expertise, and who will perform these services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense. It may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may be unable to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to deploy qualified personnel. Also, it may be difficult to replace personnel who hold government granted eligibility that may be required to obtain certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects.As some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age or otherwise leave the company, we need to provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify and integrate new personnel into these leadership roles and other key positions. Changes in our management team may disrupt our business and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate executives or other key personnel could adversely affect our results of operation. If we are unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected, the costs of executing our existing and future projects may increase and our financial performance may decline.In addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could change the tax rate on our earnings, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our judgments could prove inaccurate. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, our ability to realize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. Future changes in our tax rate or adverse changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.Systems and information technology interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.As a global company, we are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers, in order to operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays that may be planned for upgrades or that may be unplanned. Unplanned interruptions could result from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays, loss of critical or sensitive data (including personal or financial data) or loss of funds; could delay or 22Table of Contentsprevent operations (including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results); and could adversely affect our reputation or our operating results. While we have and require the maintenance of reasonable safeguards designed to protect against unavailability or loss of data, these safeguards may not be sufficient. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flows.We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. Our systems implementations also may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business.It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.As part of business operations we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Although we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted.If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We provide services to the U.S. Department of Energy and the nuclear energy industry in the on-going maintenance and modification of nuclear facilities as well as decontamination and decommissioning activities of nuclear plants. The Price-Anderson Act generally indemnifies parties performing services to nuclear power plants and Department of Energy contractors; however, not all activities we engage in on behalf of our clients are covered. Thus, if the Price-Anderson Act indemnification protections do not apply to our services, or if the exposure occurs outside of the United States in a region that does not have protections comparable to the Price-Anderson Act, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by our client's refusal to contract with us, by our inability to obtain commercially reasonable insurance or third party indemnification, or by the potentially significant monetary damages we could incur.Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on revenue, earnings and/or backlog.Certain of our contracts subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. In addition, our operational cash flows and cash balances, though predominately held in U.S. dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our project contracts globally and meet transactional requirements. We may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by implementing hedging strategies utilizing derivatives as hedging instruments. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk, and as a result, our profitability on certain projects could be affected.Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are subject to remeasurement. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly due to foreign currency volatility. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund our operations in other countries.Our reported revenue and earnings of foreign subsidiaries could also be affected by foreign currency volatility. Revenue, cost and earnings of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars. If the U.S. dollar appreciates against a foreign subsidiary's non-U.S. dollar functional currency, we would report less revenue, cost and earnings in U.S. dollars than it would have had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currency or if there had been no change in the exchange rate.23Table of ContentsThe loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.A few clients, including the U.S. government, state governments and U.S. and state government agencies, have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years, either directly or through participation in a joint venture that serves as a client. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, fail to renew or terminate their contracts with us at any time. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them. The loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Damage to our reputation could in turn cause damage to our business.Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients and other business relationships. If we fail to address issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business. These issues may include, but are not limited to, any of the risk factors discussed in this Item 1A, including compliance with laws, project execution risk, cybersecurity and safety. If our reputation is harmed, we could suffer a number of adverse consequences, such as:•reduced demand for our services;•lack of investor confidence;•less favorable credit rating;•the inability to attract and retain qualified employees;•a loss or reduction in scope of current project contracts and fewer contract awards;•less favorable contract terms;•increased need for financial assurances;•increased litigation and costs; and•heightened regulatory scrutiny.These and other consequences resulting from damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to differentiate our services through our technologies and know-how. This success includes the ability of companies in which we invest, such as NuScale, to protect their intellectual property rights. We utilize a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our interests. However, these methods only provide a limited amount of protection and may not adequately protect our interests. Our employees, contractors and joint venture partners are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights. This can be especially true in certain foreign countries where intellectual property does not have equivalent protections as in the United States, or when our joint venture partner is a competitor who will gain access to our procedures and know-how while working with us in the performance of services.Our clients require broad ownership rights in the work product and other materials we deliver. If we are not able to retain ownership of our pre-existing intellectual property and improvements thereto, it may affect our ability to provide similar services to other clients in the future, which ultimately, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Our competitors or others may independently develop technology substantially similar to our trade secret technology or we may be unsuccessful in preserving our intellectual property rights in the future. Our intellectual property rights could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or infringed upon. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention.In addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. There is a risk that we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.24Table of ContentsWe also hold licenses from third parties that may be utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. When we license our intellectual property to third parties, the scope of such license grant is limited to a particular plant or project. If such third party exceeds the scope of the license grant, and if we are unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights, our revenue and margins will be adversely impacted, and the value of our intellectual property portfolio may decline thereby adversely affecting our competitive advantage and ability to win future work.Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by impairments to goodwill, investments, deferred tax assets or other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested at least annually for impairment. Any future impairments, including impairments of goodwill, investments, deferred tax assets or other intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, if we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for a company in which we have invested, we may have to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. For cases in which we are required under the equity method or the proportionate consolidation method of accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company's income or loss, such income or loss may impact our earnings. Risks Related to Financial ReportingWe identified material weaknesses in our ICFR in 2019, which were remediated in 2020. If we identify material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results.In connection with our 2019 year-end assessment of ICFR, we determined that we did not have an effective ICFR at December 31, 2019. We took steps to improve our ICFR and determined that we have an effective ICFR at December 31, 2020.If we identify amaterial weaknesses in the future or are unable to successfully remediate any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our ICFR, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws and New York Stock Exchange listing requirements and we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties.Our prior failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital and restricts our ability to issue equity securities.We did not timely file our 2019 10-K or our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 or September 30, 2020 within the timeframe specified by the SEC. This limits our ability to utilize a shelf registration during 2021 to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we might otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. We are not eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 that would allow us to continuously incorporate by reference our SEC reports until December 2021. If we wish to pursue a public offering ahead of that date, we would be required to file a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so could take significantly longer than using a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, increase our transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.We restated certain of our previously issued financial statements during 2020, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues.As disclosed in our 2019 10-K, we restated our financial statements and related disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and for each of the interim quarterly periods in 2018 and 2019, following the identification of misstatements as a result of an internal review. The restatement also included other immaterial adjustments to historical periods, including items previously identified and corrected in earlier periods and for other non-project items identified outside of the internal review. As a result, we incurred previously unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement, and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business.25Table of ContentsRisks Related to IndebtednessAdverse credit and financial market conditions could impair our, our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect our business operations, profits and growth objectives.Our ability to generate cash is important for the funding of our operations, investing in joint ventures, the servicing of our indebtedness, paying dividends to stockholders and making acquisitions. To the extent that existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing will depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, including those arising due to events occurring in our industry, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; and those factors may affect our efforts to negotiate terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, if global economic, industry, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to establish or draw upon our credit facilities may be impacted. In addition, a downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of our borrowings or their refinancing, limit access to sources of financing or lead to other adverse consequences. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In addition, adverse credit and financial market conditions also adversely affect our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which support the continuation and expansion of projects worldwide, and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project award and execution delays, payment delays or defaults by our clients. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and profits. If we extend a significant portion of credit to our clients or projects in a specific geographic region or industry, we may experience higher levels of collection risk or non-payment if those clients are impacted by factors specific to their geographic industry or region. Our indebtedness could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, challenges and opportunities, and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate; and•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs.Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and financial results, which may be subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial and business conditions. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, we may need to refinance all or part of our existing indebtedness, borrow more money or sell securities or assets, some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. Although the terms of our credit agreements and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt, there are limitations which may preclude us from incurring the amount of indebtedness we otherwise desire.Our credit facilities, senior notes, other outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur in the future impose, or may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. In addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial covenants. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare our indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, such as our ability to timely prepare and file our periodic reports with the SEC, we have needed and may in the future need to obtain amendments to our credit agreements or waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or share price.26Table of ContentsWe may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with letters of credit, bonds or other security or credit enhancements.It is a common industry practice for clients to require us to provide surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other forms of financial assurance as credit enhancements. Surety bonds, letters of credit or guarantees indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our obligations under our contracts. Historically, we have had strong surety bonding capacity due to our investment-grade credit rating, but, bonding is provided at the surety's sole discretion. In addition, because of the overall limitations in worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to access sufficient surety bonding capacity to meet our total surety bonding needs. With regard to letters of credit, while we have historically had adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities, any capacity that may be required in excess of our credit limits would be at our lenders' sole discretion and therefore is not certain. Failure to provide credit enhancements on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project.Legal and Regulatory RisksFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to a variety of legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes in virtually every part of the world. We engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage. In addition, the nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors and suppliers occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters, including shareholder litigation. During times of economic uncertainty, especially with regard to our commodity-based clients, claim frequencies and amounts tend to increase.In proceedings where it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposure, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Our professional liability coverage is on a ""claims-made"" basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a material loss for us, and materially reduce our cash available for operations.As previously disclosed, we have received subpoenas from both the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") seeking documents and information related to projects for which we recorded charges in the second quarter of 2019 and certain project accounting, financial reporting and governance matters. We are coordinating our responses to the SEC and DOJ and cooperating in providing the requested documents and information. In addition to these investigations, a special committee of our Board of Directors independently conducted and completed a review of our prior period reporting and related control environment. If the SEC or DOJ commences legal action as a result of the investigations, we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions, cease and desist orders, and other equitable remedies. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome or timing of any governmental or regulatory investigation.In addition to these investigations, we have also had numerous securities class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative actions filed against us and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors.We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the SEC investigation, the DOJ investigation, lawsuits and related legal and regulatory matters. These expenses and the diversion of the attention of the management team that has occurred, and is expected to continue, has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a result of matters associated with the SEC and DOJ investigations and various lawsuits, we are exposed to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings, and government enforcement actions and additional subpoenas. Any future investigations or additional lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In other legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes, we may be covered by indemnification agreements that may at times be difficult to enforce. Even if enforceable, it may be difficult to recover under these agreements if the indemnitor does not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. Litigation and regulatory 27Table of Contentsproceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, including for monetary damages. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. Such proceedings can also be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to operations and distracting to management, regardless of the outcome. For further information on matters in dispute, please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.We occasionally bring claims against clients for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly provide notice or document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns and in some cases a loss on the project. These types of claims can often occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional cost, both direct and indirect. From time to time, these claims can be the subject of lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and while unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. However, there is no assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business.We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Our policies mandate strict compliance with U.S. and foreign international trade laws. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the United States, we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of Treasury. From time to time, we identify certain inadvertent or potential export or related violations. These violations may include, for example, transfers without required governmental authorization. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts.Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with anti-corruption, export control and environmental regulations; federal procurement regulations, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive government information; regulations on lobbying or similar activities; regulations pertaining to the internal control over financial reporting; and various other applicable laws or regulations. The precautions we take to prevent and detect fraud, misconduct or failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of fraud or misconduct could 28Table of Contentssubject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with government agencies, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits.New or changing legal requirements, including those relating to climate change, could adversely affect our operating results.Our business and results of operations could be affected by the passage of climate change, defense, environmental, infrastructure, trade and other laws, policies and regulations. For example, growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Legislation, international protocols or treaties, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could affect our clients, including those who (a) are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels such as our energy and chemicals clients, (b) emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels, or (c) emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. However, legislation and regulation regarding climate change could also increase the pace of development of carbon capture and storage projects, alternative transportation, alternative energy facilities, such as wind farms or nuclear reactors, or incentivize increased implementation of clean fuel projects, which could positively impact the demand for our services. As another example, the implementation of trade barriers, countervailing duties, or border taxes, or the addition, relaxation or repeal of laws, policies and regulations regarding the industries and sectors in which we work could result in a decline in demand for our services, or may make the manner in which we perform our services, especially from outside the United States, less cost efficient. Furthermore, changes to existing trade agreements may impact our business operations. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us and our clients.Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations. Our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, including nuclear and other radioactive materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. It is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations. The applicable regulations, as well as the length of time available to comply with those regulations, continue to develop and change. The cost of complying with rulings and regulations, satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we are found responsible, or satisfying claims or judgments alleging personal injury, property damage or natural resource damages as a result of exposure to, or contamination by, hazardous materials, including as a result of commodities such as lead or asbestos-related products, could be substantial, may not be covered by insurance, could reduce our profits, and therefore, could materially impact our future operations.Our company, along with our investment in NuScale, is subject to a number of regulations such as those from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Commission and the European Union, which can have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations and investments. Delays in receiving necessary approvals, permits or licenses, the failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs, and other problems encountered during construction (including changes to such regulatory requirements) could significantly increase our costs or have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our return on investments and our financial position.A substantial portion of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to environmental matters. A reduction in the number or scope of these laws or regulations, or changes in government policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could significantly reduce the size of one of our markets and limit our opportunities for growth or reduce our revenue below current levels.Risks Related to Mergers & Acquisitions and Strategic PlansWe cannot assure the successful implementation of our strategic and operational initiatives.We have announced a number of strategic and operational initiatives designed to optimize costs and improve operational efficiency, including plans to divest our AMECO and Stork businesses, monetize surplus real estate and non-core investments, and rationalize resources and overhead across various geographies. Our ability to successfully execute these initiatives is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including regulatory intervention, which may negatively impact the realization of expected benefits. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute, 29Table of Contentscompetition, economic conditions, and other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any acquisitions, dispositions or other investments are subject to various risks or uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated time frame, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.We have made and expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions or dispositions of businesses, or investments in strategic business opportunities. We may be unable to locate suitable acquisitions or investments, or we may be unable to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us. Acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted or jurisdictions where we have had little to no prior operations experience and thus expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have traditionally experienced. We also may encounter difficulties identifying all significant risks during our due diligence activities or integrating acquisitions and successfully managing or achieving the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions. We may invest in companies or businesses that fail, causing a loss of all or part of our investment.Divesting businesses involves risks and uncertainties, such as the difficulty separating assets related to such businesses from the businesses we retain, employee distraction, the need to obtain regulatory approvals and other third-party consents, which potentially disrupts customer and vendor relationships, and the fact that we may be subject to additional tax obligations or loss of certain tax benefits. Such actions also involve significant costs and require time and attention of our management, which may divert attention from other business operations. Because of these challenges, as well as market conditions or other factors, anticipated divestitures may take longer or be costlier or generate fewer benefits than expected and may not be completed at all. If we are unable to complete the divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted. If we dispose of a business, we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or, even if such liabilities are assumed, we may have difficulties enforcing our rights, contractual or otherwise, against the buyer. We may retain exposure on financial or performance guarantees and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations, and potential liabilities that may arise under law because of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer. As a result, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the divestiture of any business could negatively impact our profitability because of losses that may result from such a sale, the loss of revenues or a decrease in cash flows. Following a divestiture, we may also have less diversity in our business and in the markets we serve, as well as in our client base.We may be unable to successfully integrate acquisitions or investments we make into our businesses or capture the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and investments.Whenever we make an acquisition or investment, we have and will continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating or aligning the business practices and operations of companies we acquire or invest in. Difficulties we may encounter in the integration/alignment process include:•A delay in the integration or alignment of management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;•Diversion of the attention of management as a result of the acquisition or investment;•The consequences of a change in tax treatment, including the costs of integration/consolidation and compliance, and the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition/investment will not be realized;•Differences in corporate culture and management philosophies;•The ability to retain key personnel;•The challenges of integrating or aligning complex systems, technology, networks and other assets into or to be compatible with ours in a way that minimizes any adverse effects on the business; and•Potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisition or investment, including the costs to integrate or consolidate beyond current estimates.Any of these factors could negatively affect our ability to maintain business relationships or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or investment.30Table of ContentsRisks Related to our Common StockIn the event we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.We may in the future issue additional equity securities to pay for potential acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives. If we do issue additional equity securities, the issuance may dilute our earnings per share and stockholders' percentage ownership.Delaware law, our charter documents and our stockholder rights agreement may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Fluor is a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:•stockholders may not act by written consent;•there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting or to nominate a director for election; and•our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.These types of provisions in our charters and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares.On March 24, 2020, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of a limited duration stockholder rights agreement and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock. The rights are designed to ensure that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company and to protect against abusive tactics to gain control of the company without paying all stockholders a premium for that control. The stockholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our Board of Directors and may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to stockholders and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock"
0,FLR,FLUOR CORP,2020-09-25,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
We operate in a complex and rapidly changing global environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price. The risks described below highlight some of the factors that have affected and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently think are immatedrial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and stock price could be materially adversely affected.The COVID-19 pandemic has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.A novel strain of coronavirus (""COVID-19"") was first reported in December 2019 and has since spread to over 200 countries and territories, including every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020 the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. There have been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, government restrictions on movement, business closures and suspensions, canceled events and activities, self-isolation, and other voluntary or mandated changes in behavior. Both the outbreak of the disease and actions to slow its spread have created significant uncertainty and economic volatility and disruption, which have impacted and may continue to impact our business operations and have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our workforce and business operations as well as our results of operations, cash flows and financial performance, including, but not limited to, the following:•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, reductions in demand for certain of our services and the delay or abandonment of ongoing or anticipated projects due to our clients’, suppliers’ and other third parties’ diminished financial conditions or financial distress, as well as governmental budget constraints. These impacts are expected to continue or worsen if stay-at-home, social distancing, travel restrictions and other similar orders or restrictions remain in place for an extended period of time or are re-imposed after being lifted or eased. •Some clients have been, and may in the future be, unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner, including as a result of deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic impacts. Further, other third parties, such as suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and other outside business partners, have experienced significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us, or they may be unable to do so in the future altogether.•Many employers, including us, and governments continue to require all or a significant portion of employees to work from home or not go into their offices. While many of our employees can effectively perform their responsibilities while working remotely, some work may not be completed as efficiently as if it were performed on site. Additionally, we may be exposed to unexpected cybersecurity risks and additional information technology-related expenses as a result of these remote working requirements. •Illness, travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, our supply chain, our ability to timely and satisfactorily complete our clients’ projects, our ability to provide services to our clients or our other business processes.•We have furloughed certain employees and may need to further furlough or reduce the number of employees that we employ. We may experience difficulties associated with hiring additional employees or replacing employees, in particular with respect to roles that require security clearances or other special qualifications that may be limited or difficult to obtain. •In addition to existing travel restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could materially impair our ability to support our operations and clients (both domestic and international), to source supplies through the global supply chain and to identify, pursue and capture new business opportunities, and which could continue to restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces. We also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any future government orders or other measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.•The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility and pricing in the capital markets, and that increased volatility is likely to continue. We might not be able to access further sources of liquidity on acceptable pricing or borrowing terms if at all. Any inability to obtain additional liquidity as and when needed, or to maintain compliance with the 15Table of Contentsinstruments governing our indebtedness, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. •We operate in many countries around the world, and certain of those countries’ governments may be unable to effectively mitigate the financial or other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their economies and workforces and our operations therein.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact us depends on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not currently able to predict and may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this 2019 10-K, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us, our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.The demand for our services is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, maintenance and management needs. Our clients' interest in approving new projects, budgets for capital expenditures and need for our services have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by, among other things, poor economic conditions, low commodity prices, political uncertainties and currency devaluations. Clients have been and remain selective in how they allocate and expend their capital, which has resulted in a reduction of the number of projects we may bid on and win, especially the larger scale projects in which we specialize. For example, in our Energy & Chemicals segment, capital expenditures by our clients are influenced by factors such as prevailing prices and expectations about future prices for underlying commodities, technological advances, the costs of exploration, production and delivery of product, domestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions and other similar factors. As a result of the precipitous decline in oil prices beginning in the first quarter of 2020, demand for our services in our Energy & Chemicals segment has been adversely impacted. There is no guarantee that the modest recovery in oil prices will be sustained, and the timing and extent of any future improvements in demand remain uncertain. Industries served by that segment and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services.Our revenue and earnings are largely dependent on the award of new contracts, which we do not directly control.The awarding and timing of projects is unpredictable and outside of our control. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors including a client's decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid on due to price, a client's perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or include terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem acceptable, especially when the markets for the services we typically offer are relatively soft. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly and annually depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated. Additionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, recent changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and economic volatility and disruption. We cannot predict the outcome of these or other unanticipated economic and political conditions.The nature of our contracts, particularly those that are fixed-price, subject us to risks associated with delays and cost overruns, which may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Because our projects are often technically complex, with multiple phases occurring over several years, we incur risks in our project execution activities. These risks could result in project delays, cost overruns or other problems and can include the following:•Incorrect assumptions related to productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including with respect to the impacts of inflation on lump-sum or fixed-price contracts;•Unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;16Table of Contents•Inaccurate representations of site conditions and unanticipated changes in the project execution plan;•Project modifications creating unanticipated costs or delays and failure to properly manage project modifications;•Inability to achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards with regard to engineering, construction or project management obligations;•Insufficient or inadequate project execution tools and systems needed to record, track, forecast and control cost and schedule;•Reliance on historic cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current economic and/or execution conditions;•Failure to accurately estimate the cost of projects, including due to unforeseen increases in the cost of labor;•Unanticipated increases in the cost of raw materials, components or equipment, including due to the imposition of import tariffs;•Failure to properly make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards;•Failure to properly assess and update appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures;•Difficulties related to the performance of our clients, partners, subcontractors, suppliers or other third parties;•Delays or productivity issues caused by weather; and•Changes in local laws or difficulties or delays in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals.These and other risks have in the past and may in the future result in our failure to achieve contractual cost or schedule commitments, safety performance, overall client satisfaction or other performance criteria. As a result, we may receive lower fees or lose our ability to earn incentive fees. In other cases, our fee will not change but we will have to continue to perform work without additional fees until the performance criteria is achieved. We may also be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to complete a project on schedule. In addition, if we fail to meet guaranteed performance or quality standards, we may be held responsible under the guarantee or warranty provisions of our contract for cost impact to the client, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or an obligation to re-perform work. To the extent these events occur, the total cost to the project (including any liquidated damages we become liable to pay) could be material and could, in some circumstances, equal or exceed the full value of the contract. In such events, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and negatively impacted.In circumstances where the contract is lump-sum or the revenue is otherwise fixed, we bear a significant portion of the risk for delays and cost overruns. Reimbursable contract types, such as those that include negotiated hourly billing rates, may restrict the kinds or amounts of costs that are reimbursable, therefore exposing us to the risk that we may incur certain costs in executing these contracts that are above our estimates and not recoverable from our clients.We identified material weaknesses in our ICFR. If we are unable to successfully remediate, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately and timely report our financial results, in which case our business may be harmed, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the price of our common stock may decline.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate ICFR and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our ICFR is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.In connection with our 2019 year-end assessment of ICFR, we determined that we did not have an effective ICFR. We have taken and are taking certain remedial steps to improve our ICFR.17Table of ContentsRemediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes. As a result, we may not be successful in making the improvements necessary to remediate the material weaknesses identified by management, be able to do so in a timely manner, or be able to identify and remediate additional control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the future.If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected; our liquidity, our access to capital markets, the perceptions of our creditworthiness, and our ability to complete acquisitions may be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws, New York Stock Exchange listing requirements, and the covenants under our debt instruments regarding the timely filing of periodic reports; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting; we may suffer defaults or accelerations under our debt instruments to the extent we are unable to obtain waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or are unable to cure any breaches; and our stock price may decline.Our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, restricts our ability to issue equity securities, including within the Fluor Corporation Employees’ Savings Investment Plan and the TRS 401(k) Retirement Plan (collectively, the “Plan”), and could impact our listing on the New York Stock Exchange.We did not timely file our 2019 10-K or our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 within each respective timeframe required by the SEC, meaning we have not remained current in our reporting requirements with the SEC. This limits our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we might otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. We are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 that would allow us to continuously incorporate by reference our SEC reports into the registration statement, or to use ""shelf"" registration statements to conduct offerings, until approximately one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. If we wish to pursue a public offering now, we would be required to file a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would take significantly longer than using a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, and the necessity of using a Form S-1 for a public offering of registered securities could, to the extent we are not able to conduct offerings using alternative methods, adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.In addition, as a result of the failure to remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use Form S-8 registration statements. As a result, on April 30, 2020, the administrator of the Plan issued a notice to Plan participants advising participants of a blackout period during which participants are prohibited from acquiring beneficial ownership of additional interests in the Fluor Corporation Common Stock Fund. If we are not able to become and remain current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, it restricts our ability to maintain the Fluor Corporation Common Stock Fund or issue other equity securities to our employees.As previously disclosed, we also received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange regarding our noncompliance with Section 802.01E of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. The New York Stock Exchange originally granted the Company until September 18, 2020 to come into compliance with Section 802.01E, which was later extended to January 15, 2021, to file this 2019 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, which we expect to file as promptly as practicable following the filing of this 2019 10-K. If we are unable to file such reports before the deadline contained in the extension, our common stock may be subject to delisting by the New York Stock Exchange. We reached a determination to restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues.As discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we reached a determination to restate our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 and for each of the interim quarterly periods in 2018 and 2019, following the identification of misstatements as a result of the internal review conducted. The restatement also included other immaterial adjustments to historical periods, including items previously identified and corrected in earlier periods and for other non-project items identified outside of the internal review in the ordinary course. As a result, we have incurred unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement, and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business.18Table of ContentsIntense competition in the global engineering, procurement and construction industry can reduce our market share and profits.We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These markets require substantial resources and investment in technology and skilled personnel. We also see a continuing influx of non-traditional competitors offering below-market pricing while accepting greater risk. Competition places downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and has in the past forced, and may in the future force, us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk of losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. To the extent we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits.From time to time, we are involved in litigation and regulatory proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes that may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to a variety of legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes in virtually every part of the world. We engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage. In addition, the nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors and suppliers occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters, including shareholder litigation. During times of economic uncertainty, especially with regard to our commodity-based clients, claim frequencies and amounts tend to increase.In proceedings where it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposure, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Our professional liability coverage is on a ""claims-made"" basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a material loss for us, and materially reduce our cash available for operations.As previously disclosed, we have received subpoenas from both the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") seeking documents and information related to projects for which we recorded charges in the second quarter of 2019 and certain project accounting, financial reporting and governance matters. We are coordinating our responses to the SEC and DOJ and cooperating in providing the requested documents and information. In addition to these investigations, a special committee of our Board of Directors independently conducted and completed a review of our prior period reporting and related control environment. If the SEC or DOJ commences legal action as a result of the investigations, we could be required to pay significant penalties and become subject to injunctions, cease and desist orders, and other equitable remedies. The investigations will not be resolved as a result of the completion of the internal review and the filing of this 2019 10-K. We can provide no assurances as to the outcome or timing of any governmental or regulatory investigation.In addition to these investigations, we have also had numerous securities class action lawsuits and stockholder derivative actions filed against us and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors.We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses related to legal, accounting, and other professional services in connection with the internal review, the SEC investigation, the DOJ investigation, lawsuits and related legal and regulatory matters. These expenses, the delay in timely filing 2019 10-K, the delay in timely filing our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and the diversion of the attention of the management team that has occurred, and is expected to continue, has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, and cash flows.As a result of matters associated with the internal review, the SEC and DOJ investigations and various lawsuits, we are exposed to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings, and government enforcement actions and additional subpoenas. Any future investigations or additional lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.In other legal or regulatory proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes, we may be covered by indemnification agreements that may at times be difficult to enforce. Even if enforceable, it may be difficult to recover under these agreements if the indemnitor does not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. Litigation and regulatory 19Table of Contentsproceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, including for monetary damages. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. Such proceedings can also be costly, time-consuming, disruptive to operations and distracting to management, regardless of the outcome. For further information on matters in dispute, please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly provide notice or document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns and in some cases a loss on the project. These types of claims can often occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional cost, both direct and indirect. From time to time, these claims can be the subject of lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and while unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.The success of our use of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.In the ordinary course of business, and as has become increasingly common in our industry, we execute specific projects and otherwise conduct certain operations through joint ventures, consortiums, partnerships and other collaborative arrangements (collectively, ""ventures""), including ICA Fluor and COOEC Fluor Heavy Industries (""COOEC Fluor""). We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with the third party client; however, services may be performed directly by the venture, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof.Our success in many of our markets is dependent, in part, on the presence or capability of a local partner. If we are unable to compete alone, or with a quality partner, our ability to win work and successfully complete our contracts may be impacted. Differences in opinions or views between venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues, which could adversely affect the business and operations of our ventures. In many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement.At times, we also participate in ventures where we are not a controlling party or where we team with unaffiliated parties on a particular project bid. In such instances, we may have limited control over venture decisions and actions, including internal controls and financial reporting, which may have an impact on our business. If internal control problems arise within the joint venture, or if our joint venture partners have financial or operational issues, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The success of these and other ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their venture obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. If our venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their venture obligations, the venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery by the venture of the contracted services and to meet any performance guarantees. From time to time, in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, we may accept risks or responsibilities for the venture that are not necessarily proportionate with the reward we expect to receive or that may differ from risks or responsibilities we would normally accept in our own operations. We may also be subject to joint and several liability for our venture partners under the applicable contracts for venture projects. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for us with respect to the venture, and in turn, our business and operations. In addition, a failure by a venture partner to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or, in the case of government contracts, even debarment.20Table of ContentsCyber-security breaches of our systems and information technology could adversely impact our ability to operate.We utilize, develop, install and maintain a number of information technology systems both for us and for others. Various privacy and security laws require us to protect sensitive and confidential information from disclosure. In addition, we are bound by our client and other contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information (whether it be ours or a third party's information entrusted to us) from disclosure. Our computer systems, as well as those of our clients, contractors and other vendors, face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, viruses, malicious code, cyber attacks, phishing and other security incursions and system disruptions, including attempts to improperly access our confidential and proprietary information as well as the confidential and proprietary information of our clients and other business partners. While we endeavor to maintain industry-accepted security measures and technology to secure our computer systems and while we endeavor to ensure our cloud vendors that store our data maintain similar measures, these systems and the information stored on these systems may still be subject to threats. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Further, as these security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to protect, prevent, detect and respond against such threats. A party who circumvents our security measures, or those of our clients, contractors or other vendors, could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, improperly manipulate data, or cause damage or interruptions to systems. Any of these events could damage our reputation, result in litigation and regulatory fines and penalties, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance that specifically covers cyber-security threats, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.Our business is subject to international economic and political conditions that change (sometimes frequently) for reasons that are beyond our control. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 74% our backlog consisted of revenue to be derived from projects and services to be completed outside the United States. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future.Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:•abrupt changes in government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;•embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;•restrictions on currency movement;•tax or tariff increases;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including logistical and communication challenges;•U.S. government trade or other policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we or our clients operate;•other social, political and economic instability, including recessions and other economic crises in other regions;•natural disasters and public health crises, including pandemics such as COVID-19;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country;•international hostilities; and•unrest, civil strife, acts of war, terrorism and insurrection.Also, the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of the countries where we operate may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights or to defend ourself against claims made by others. We operate in locations where there is a significant amount of political risk. In addition, military action or continued unrest could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere, and increase our security costs. Our level of exposure to these risks will vary on each project, depending on the location of the project and the particular stage of each such project. For example, our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development phase, such as engineering, will generally be less than our risk 21Table of Contentsexposure on a project that is in the construction phase. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions and risks, we may experience project disruptions and losses. Project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our overall revenue and profits.In addition, the 2016 referendum by the British voters to exit the European Union, commonly referred to as ""Brexit,"" adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in the weakening of the British pound against other currencies. A weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our United Kingdom operations and contracts, denominated in the British pound, to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. The U.K. formally exited the E.U. on January 30, 2020, pursuant to a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. government and the E.U. The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period from February through December 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed. Volatility in exchange rates may continue as the U.K. negotiates its future relationship with the E.U. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our international operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations and could adversely affect our results of operations.Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and, therefore, may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or earnings.Our backlog generally consists of projects for which we have an executed contract or commitment with a client and reflects our expected revenue from the contract or commitment, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable or will not be subject to delay or suspension. Project cancellations, scope adjustments or deferrals, or foreign currency fluctuations may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn; or, may cause the rate at which we perform on our backlog to decrease. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them allowing clients to cancel projects already awarded to us. Our contracts typically provide for the payment of fees earned through the date of termination and the reimbursement of costs incurred including demobilization costs. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. During periods of economic slowdown, or decreases and/or instability in commodity prices, the risk of backlog projects being suspended, delayed or canceled generally increases. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and our profits.Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.We often work on complex projects, frequently in geographically remote or high-risk locations that are subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. In addition, our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment, dangerous processes or substances or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. Often, we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, increasing project costs and raising our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries or even loss of life, the completion of a project could be delayed and we could experience investigations or litigation. Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability. Despite these activities, in these locations and at these sites, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel, nor can we guarantee our work, equipment or supplies will be free from damage.Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, severe weather conditions, public health crises, political crises or other catastrophic events, could negatively impact our ability to operate or increase our costs to operate. Such events may result in delays in our operations; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs or shortages; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such events, unless a contract provision provides us with relief from our obligations. The extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our clients. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from such an event, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients, which may reduce our profits and result in losses.22Table of ContentsOur actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.In preparing our financial statements, we are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:•recognition of contract revenue, costs, profits or losses in applying the principles of percentage-of-completion accounting;•recognition of revenues related to project incentives or awards we expect to receive;•recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;•estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;•collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts;•asset valuations;•income tax provisions and related valuation allowances;•determination of expense and potential liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and•accruals for other estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves.Estimates are based on management's reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results due to changes in facts and circumstances, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. Further, we are required to record contract revenue as work on a contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at any point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenues that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when such estimates are revised. Such adjustments could be material and could result in reduced profitability.If we experience delays and/or defaults in client payments, we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures.Because of the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from clients in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred. Some of our clients have found it difficult to pay invoices for our services timely, especially as commodity prices are volatile or relatively low, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients for our large projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time, it has been and may in the future be difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. In addition, clients may request extension of the payment terms otherwise agreed to under our contracts. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.Some of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a fixed-price type contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, technology, equipment or services as required under a contract to us, our joint venture partner, our client or any other party involved in the project for any reason, or provides supplies, technology, equipment or services that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies, technology, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact contract profitability. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. These risks may be intensified during an economic downturn if these suppliers or subcontractors experience financial difficulties or find it difficult 23Table of Contentsto obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the services or supplies necessary for our business. In addition, in instances where we rely on a single contracted supplier or subcontractor or a small number of suppliers or subcontractors, if a subcontractor or supplier were to fail, there can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide replacement technology, equipment, materials or services on a timely basis or at the costs we had anticipated. A failure by a third-party subcontractor or supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension, or in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Adverse credit and financial market conditions could impair our, our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect our business operations, profits and growth objectives.Our ongoing ability to generate cash is important for the funding of our continuing operations, investing in joint ventures, the servicing of our indebtedness, paying dividends to stockholders and making acquisitions. To the extent that existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, including those arising due to events occurring in our industry, as well as conditions in our business and our operating results; and those factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, if global economic, industry, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions that provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to draw upon our credit facilities may be impacted. In addition, a downgrade in our credit rating or any of our indebtedness could increase the cost of further borrowings or refinancings of such indebtedness, limit access to sources of financing in the future or lead to other adverse consequences. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In addition, adverse credit and financial market conditions also adversely affect our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which support the continuation and expansion of projects worldwide, and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project award and execution delays, payment delays or defaults by our clients. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and profits. If we extend a significant portion of credit to our clients or projects in a specific geographic region or industry, we may experience higher levels of collection risk or non-payment if those clients are impacted by factors specific to their geographic industry or region. Finally, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy, and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy as a whole.We have significant indebtedness, which could lead to adverse consequences or adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, and any refinancing of this debt could be at significantly higher interest rates.Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, challenges and opportunities, and changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and debt service requirements and other financing needs; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt.Our ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our future operating performance and financial results, which will be subject, in part, to factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial and business conditions. If we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our indebtedness, we may need to refinance all or part of our existing indebtedness, borrow more money or sell securities or assets, some or all of which may not be available to us at acceptable terms or at all. In addition, we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. Although the terms of our credit agreements and our bond indentures allow us to incur additional debt, this is subject to certain limitations which may preclude us from incurring the amount of indebtedness we otherwise desire.24Table of ContentsOur credit facilities, senior notes, commercial paper program, other outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur in the future impose, or may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. In addition, our credit facilities require us to maintain specified financial ratios. A breach of any of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default under the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare our indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. If our operating performance declines, or if we are unable to comply with any covenant, such as our ability to timely prepare and file our periodic reports with the SEC, we have needed and may in the future need to obtain amendments to our credit agreements or waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or ordinary share price.Due to the delays in the preparation of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, we are not in compliance with certain reporting covenants under certain of our credit facilities. As previously disclosed, we entered into amendments to the credit facilities, pursuant to which the lenders extended the deadline by which we are required to deliver to the lenders our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 to no later than September 30, 2020, and our unaudited financial statements for the first, second and third quarters of 2020 to no later than October 31, 2020, November 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The filing of this 2019 10-K will constitute compliance with the requirement to furnish the lenders a copy of the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. However, we may not be able to secure similar amendments or waivers in the future for any further delays in our periodic reports with the SEC, including for our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020. In addition, on August 11, 2020, we received a notice of default dated August 5, 2019 from the trustee under the indenture governing our 4.250% Senior Notes due September 15, 2028 (the ""2018 Notes""), 1.750% Senior Notes due March 21, 2023 (the ""2016 Notes"") and 3.5% Senior Notes due December 15, 2024 (the ""2014 Notes,"" and together with the 2018 Notes and 2016 Notes, the ""Notes""), as a result of the delay in the filing of this 2019 10-K and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020. Under the terms of the indenture, we are required to provide to the trustee copies of all annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC within 15 days of the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and regulations. Under the indenture, we have 90 days from the receipt of the notice of default to file this 2019 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020.  If we do not cure the default within such 90-day period, or if we receive further notices of default in the future and do not cure such defaults, the trustee with respect to the Notes or holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may accelerate the Notes and all unpaid principal and accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding would become immediately due and payable. We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with letters of credit, bonds or other security or credit enhancements.In certain of our business lines it is industry practice for clients to require surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other forms of credit enhancement. Surety bonds, letters of credit or guarantees indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our obligations under our contracts. Historically, we have had strong surety bonding capacity due to our investment-grade credit rating, but, bonding is provided at the surety's sole discretion. In addition, because of the overall limitations in worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sufficient surety bonding capacity to meet our total surety bonding needs. With regard to letters of credit, while we have historically had adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities, any capacity that may be required in excess of our credit limits would be at our lenders' sole discretion and therefore is not certain. Failure to provide credit enhancements on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project.We cannot assure the successful implementation of our strategic and operational initiatives.In 2019, we announced a number of strategic and operational initiatives designed to optimize costs and improve operational efficiency, including plans to divest our AMECO business, monetize surplus real estate and non-core investments, and rationalize resources and overhead across various geographies. Our ability to successfully execute these initiatives is subject to various risks and uncertainties and there can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all. Our failure to realize the anticipated benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute the various elements of our initiatives, competition, economic conditions, and other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 25Table of ContentsAny acquisitions, dispositions or other investments are subject to various risks or uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated time frame, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.We have made and expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions or dispositions of businesses, or investments in strategic business opportunities. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or investments, or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that such transactions will be successful. Acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted or jurisdictions where we have had little to no prior operations experience and thus expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have traditionally experienced. We also may encounter difficulties identifying all significant risks during our due diligence activities or integrating acquisitions and successfully managing or achieving the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions. We may invest in companies or businesses that fail, causing a loss of all or part of our investment.Divesting businesses involves risks and uncertainties, such as the difficulty separating assets related to such businesses from the businesses we retain, employee distraction, the need to obtain regulatory approvals and other third-party consents, which potentially disrupts customer and vendor relationships, and the fact that we may be subject to additional tax obligations or loss of certain tax benefits. Such actions also involve significant costs and require time and attention of our management, which may divert attention from other business operations. Because of these challenges, as well as market conditions or other factors, the anticipated divestitures may take longer or be costlier or generate fewer benefits than expected and may not be completed at all. If we are unable to complete the divestitures or to successfully transition divested businesses, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted. If we dispose of a business, we may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or, even if such liabilities are assumed, we may have difficulties enforcing our rights, contractual or otherwise, against the buyer. We may retain exposure on financial or performance guarantees and other contractual, employment, pension and severance obligations, and potential liabilities that may arise under law because of the disposition or the subsequent failure of an acquirer. As a result, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the divestiture of any business could negatively impact our profitability because of losses that may result from such a sale, the loss of revenues or a decrease in cash flows. Following a divestiture, we may also have less diversity in our business and in the markets we serve, as well as in our client base. Although we expect to realize certain benefits as a result of our acquisitions and investments, there is a possibility that we may be unable to successfully integrate our businesses or capitalize upon our investments in order to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and investments or do so within the intended timeframe.Whenever we make an acquisition or investment, we have and will continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating or aligning the business practices and operations of companies we acquire or invest in. Difficulties we may encounter in the integration/alignment process include:•A delay in the integration or alignment of management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;•Diversion of the attention of management as a result of the acquisition or investment;•The consequences of a change in tax treatment, including the costs of integration/consolidation and compliance, and the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition/investment will not be realized;•Differences in corporate culture and management philosophies;•The ability to retain key personnel;•The challenges of integrating or aligning complex systems, technology, networks and other assets into or to be compatible with ours in a way that minimizes any adverse effects on the business; and•Potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisition or investment, including the costs to integrate or consolidate beyond current estimates.Any of these factors could affect each company's ability to maintain business relationships or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or investment, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.26Table of ContentsOur U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.We enter into significant government contracts from time to time, such as those contracts that we have in place with the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Defense. U.S. government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by government representatives and profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. U.S. government contracts are also subject to uncertainties associated with Congressional funding, including the potential impacts of budget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. A significant portion of our business is derived as a result of U.S. government regulatory, military and infrastructure priorities. Changes in these priorities, which can occur due to policy changes or changes in the economy, could adversely impact our revenues. The U.S. government is under no obligation to maintain program funding at any specific level, and funds for a program may even be eliminated. Our U.S. government clients may terminate or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice.In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR""), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards (""CAS""), the Service Contract Act and Department of Defense security regulations. Failure to comply with any of these regulations and other government requirements may result in contract price adjustments, financial penalties or contract termination. Our U.S. government contracts are also subject to audits, cost reviews and investigations by U.S. government contracting oversight agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (the ""DCAA""). The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies (including our labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems). The DCAA also has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the FAR and CAS. The DCAA presents its report findings to the Defense Contract Management Agency (""DCMA""). Should the DCMA determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contract and applicable statutes and regulations, or if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities, payments to us may be disallowed or we could be required to refund previously collected payments. Additionally, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, suspension or debarment from future government contracts, and qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble damages. These suits may remain under seal (and hence, be unknown to us) for some time while the government decides whether to intervene on behalf of the qui tam plaintiff. Furthermore, in this environment, if we have significant disagreements with our government clients concerning costs incurred, negative publicity could arise, which could adversely affect our industry reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts in the government arena or otherwise.Most U.S. government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions that generally require those contractors that have been previously awarded the contract to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under the contract. Such processes require successful contractors to anticipate requirements and develop rapid-response bid and proposal teams as well as dedicated supplier relationships and delivery systems to react to these needs. We face rigorous competition and significant pricing pressures in order to win these task orders. If we are not successful in reducing costs or able to timely respond to government requests, we may not win additional awards. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may not be awarded the contract because of existing government policies designed to protect small businesses and under- represented minority contractors. Our inability to win or renew government contracts during the procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our profits and revenues.Many of our U.S. government contracts require security clearances. Depending upon the level of clearance required, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing government clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them, thus adversely affecting our revenues.Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, an automatic sequestration process, or across-the-board budget cuts (a large portion of which were defense-related), was triggered when the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, a committee of twelve members of Congress, failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan for the U.S. federal budget. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (the “BBA”) eliminates sequestration on discretionary accounts in 2020 and 2021 by increasing federal discretionary spending limits until 2021. The BBA also temporarily suspends the public debt limit through July 31, 2021. However, the Budget Control Act of 2011 remains in place, extended through 2029, and absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending from 2022 through 2029. A significant reduction in federal government spending or a change in budgetary priorities could reduce demand for our services, cancel or 27Table of Contentsdelay federal projects, and result in the closure of federal facilities and significant personnel reductions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.If one or more of our U.S. government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience, if we are suspended or debarred from U.S. government contract work, or if payment of our cost is disallowed, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue and profits.Our continued success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.The success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract, develop and retain personnel, including engineers, project management, craft employees and management around the globe, who have the necessary and required experience and expertise, and who will perform these services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense. It may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. Also, it may be difficult to replace personnel who hold government granted eligibility that may be required to obtain certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience. Loss of the services of, or failure to recruit, qualified technical and management personnel could limit our ability to successfully complete existing projects and compete for new projects.As some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age or otherwise leave the company, we need to provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify and integrate new personnel into these leadership roles and other key positions. Changes in our management team may disrupt our business and the failure to successfully transition and assimilate executives or other key personnel could adversely affect our results of operation. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected, the costs of executing our existing and future projects may increase and our financial performance may decline.In addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.Our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could result in a lower or higher tax rate on our earnings, which could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determinations could be found to be incorrect. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. Future increases in our tax rate or adverse changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.Systems and information technology interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.As a global company, we are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers, in order to operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays that may be planned for upgrades or that may be unplanned. Unplanned interruptions could result from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays, loss of critical or sensitive data (including personal or financial data) or loss of funds; could delay or prevent operations (including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results); and could adversely affect our reputation or our operating results. While we have and require the maintenance of reasonable safeguards designed to protect against unavailability or loss of data, these safeguards may not be sufficient. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flows.28Table of ContentsWe continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. Our systems implementations also may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. However, there is no assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business.We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Our policies mandate strict compliance with U.S. and foreign international trade laws. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the United States, we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of Treasury. From time to time, we identify certain inadvertent or potential export or related violations. These violations may include, for example, transfers without required governmental authorization. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts.Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with anti-corruption, export control and environmental regulations; federal procurement regulations, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive government information; regulations on lobbying or similar activities; regulations pertaining to the internal control over financial reporting; and various other applicable laws or regulations. The precautions we take to prevent and detect fraud, misconduct or failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of fraud or misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with government agencies, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits.It can be very difficult and expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.As part of business operations we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. Our insurance is purchased 29Table of Contentsfrom a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted.New or changing legal requirements, including those relating to climate change, could adversely affect our operating results.Our business and results of operations could be affected by the passage of climate change, defense, environmental, infrastructure, trade and other laws, policies and regulations. For example, growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Legislation, international protocols or treaties, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could affect our clients, including those who (a) are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels such as our energy and chemicals clients, (b) emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels, or (c) emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. However, legislation and regulation regarding climate change could also increase the pace of development of carbon capture and storage projects, alternative transportation, alternative energy facilities, such as wind farms or nuclear reactors, or incentivize increased implementation of clean fuel projects, which could positively impact the demand for our services. As another example, the implementation of trade barriers, countervailing duties, or border taxes, or the addition, relaxation or repeal of laws, policies and regulations regarding the industries and sectors in which we work could result in a decline in demand for our services, or may make the manner in which we perform our services, especially from outside the United States, less cost efficient. Furthermore, changes to existing trade agreements may impact our business operations. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us and our clients.Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional cost on us that reduce our profits.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations. Our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, including nuclear and other radioactive materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. It is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations. The applicable regulations, as well as the length of time available to comply with those regulations, continue to develop and change. The cost of complying with rulings and regulations, satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we are found responsible, or satisfying claims or judgments alleging personal injury, property damage or natural resource damages as a result of exposure to, or contamination by, hazardous materials, including as a result of commodities such as lead or asbestos-related products, could be substantial, may not be covered by insurance, could reduce our profits, and therefore, could materially impact our future operations.Our company, along with our investment in NuScale, is subject to a number of regulations such as those from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Commission and the European Union, which can have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations and investments. Delays in receiving necessary approvals, permits or licenses, the failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs, and other problems encountered during construction (including changes to such regulatory requirements) could significantly increase our costs or have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our return on investments, our financial position and our cash flow.A substantial portion of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to environmental matters. A reduction in the number or scope of these laws or regulations, or changes in government policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could significantly reduce the size of one of our markets and limit our opportunities for growth or reduce our revenue below current levels.If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We provide services to the U.S. Department of Energy and the nuclear energy industry in the on-going maintenance and modification of nuclear facilities as well as decontamination and decommissioning activities of nuclear plants. The Price-Anderson Act generally indemnifies parties performing services to nuclear power plants and Department of Energy contractors; however, not all activities we engage in on behalf of our clients are covered. Thus, if the Price-Anderson Act indemnification protections do not apply to our services, or if the exposure occurs outside of the United States in a region that 30Table of Contentsdoes not have protections comparable to the Price-Anderson Act, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by our client's refusal to contract with us, by our inability to obtain commercially reasonable insurance or third party indemnification, or by the potentially significant monetary damages we could incur.Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on company revenue, earnings and/or backlog.Certain of our contracts subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. In addition, our operational cash flows and cash balances, though predominately held in U.S. dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our project contracts globally and meet transactional requirements. We may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by implementing hedging strategies utilizing derivatives as hedging instruments. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk, and as a result, our profitability on certain projects could be affected.Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are subject to currency fluctuations when measured period to period for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly due to foreign currency volatility. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund our operations in other countries.The company's reported revenue and earnings of foreign subsidiaries could also be affected by foreign currency volatility. Revenue, cost and earnings of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar appreciates against a foreign subsidiary's non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the company would report less revenue, cost and earnings in U.S. dollars than it would have had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currency or if there had been no change in the exchange rate.The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.A few clients, including the U.S. government, state governments and U.S. and state government agencies, have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years, either directly or through participation in a joint venture that serves as a client. See ""Item 1. - Business - Other Matters - Significant Clients"" for more information. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, fail to renew or terminate their contracts with us at any time. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them. The loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Damage to our reputation could in turn cause damage to our business.Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining our clients and other business relationships. If we fail to address issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business. These issues may include, but are not limited to, any of the risk factors discussed in this Item 1A, including compliance with laws, project execution risk, cyber security and safety. If our reputation is harmed, we could suffer a number of adverse consequences, such as:•reduced demand for our services;•lack of investor confidence;•less favorable credit rating;•the inability to attract and retain qualified employees;•a loss or reduction in scope of current project contracts and fewer contract awards;•less favorable contract terms;•increased litigation and costs; and•heightened regulatory scrutiny.These and other consequences resulting from damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.31Table of ContentsOur business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to differentiate our services through our technologies and know-how. This success includes the ability of companies in which we invest, such as NuScale, to protect their intellectual property rights. We rely principally on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our interests. However, these methods only provide a limited amount of protection and may not adequately protect our interests. Our employees, contractors and joint venture partners are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights. This can be especially true in certain foreign countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or when our joint venture partner is a competitor who will gain access to our procedures and know-how while working with us in the performance of services.Our clients require broad ownership rights in the work product and other materials we deliver. If we are not able to retain ownership of our pre-existing intellectual property and improvements thereto, it may affect our ability to provide similar services to other clients in the future, which ultimately, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We cannot provide assurances that others will not independently develop technology substantially similar to our trade secret technology or that we can successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future. Our intellectual property rights could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or infringed upon. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business.In addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. There is a risk that we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.We also hold licenses from third parties that may be utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. When we license our intellectual property to third parties, the scope of such license grant is limited to a particular plant or project. If such third party exceeds the scope of the license grant, and if we are unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights, our revenue and margins will be adversely impacted, and the value of our intellectual property portfolio may decline thereby adversely affecting our competitive advantage and ability to win future work.Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by impairments to goodwill, investments, deferred tax assets or other intangible assets. For example, when we acquire a business, we record goodwill in an amount equal to the amount we paid for the business minus the fair value of the net tangible assets and other intangible assets of the acquired business. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment. For additional description on this impairment testing, please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Any future impairments, including impairments of goodwill, investments, deferred tax assets or other intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized.In addition, if we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for a company in which we have invested, we may have to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. For cases in which we are required under the equity method or the proportionate consolidation method of accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company's income or loss, such income or loss may impact our earnings. In the event we issue additional equity securities, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.We may in the future issue additional equity securities to pay for potential acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives. If we do issue additional equity securities, the issuance may have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and stockholders' percentage ownership.32Table of ContentsDelaware law, our charter documents and our stockholder rights agreement may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Fluor is a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:•stockholders may not act by written consent;•there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting or to nominate a director for election; and•our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.These types of provisions in our charters and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares.On March 24, 2020, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of a limited duration stockholder rights agreement and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock. The rights are designed to ensure that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the company and to protect against abusive tactics to gain control of the company without paying all stockholders a premium for that control. The stockholder rights agreement would cause substantial dilution to any person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved in advance by our Board of Directors and may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a change in control that might otherwise be beneficial to stockholders and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock"
2,FLR,FLUOR CORP,2019-02-21,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.The demand for our services is dependent upon the existence of projects with engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication, maintenance and management needs. Our clients' interest in approving new projects, budgets for capital expenditures and need for our services have in the past few years, and may in the future, be adversely affected by, among other things, poor economic conditions, low commodity prices, political uncertainties and currency devaluations. Clients have been in the recent past, and remain, selective in how they allocate and expend their capital, which has resulted in a reduction of the number of projects we may bid on and win, especially the larger scale projects in which we specialize. For example, in our Energy & Chemicals segment, capital expenditures by our clients may be influenced by factors such as prevailing prices and expectations about future prices for underlying commodities, technological advances, the costs of exploration, production and delivery of product, domestic and international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions and other similar factors. Industries served by that segment and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continue to be vulnerable to general downturns, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the demand for our services.11Table of ContentsOur revenue and earnings are largely dependent on the award of new contracts, which we do not directly control.The timing of project awards is unpredictable and outside of our control. Awards, including expansions of existing projects, often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors including a client's decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid on due to price, a client's perception of our ability to perform and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or include terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem acceptable, especially when the markets for the services we typically offer are relatively soft. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly and annually depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated. Additionally, uncertain economic and political conditions may make it difficult for our clients, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. For example, recent changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs have resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future of the global economy as well as retaliatory trade measures implemented by other countries. We cannot predict the outcome of these changing trade policies or other unanticipated political conditions.Our project execution activities, including any failure to meet schedule or cost estimates, may result in reduced profits or losses that could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.Because our projects are often technically complex, with multiple phases occurring over several years, we incur risks in our project execution activities. These risks could result in project delays, cost overruns or other problems and can include the following:•Incorrect assumptions related to productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including with respect to the impacts of inflation on lump-sum or fixed-price contracts;•Unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;•Inaccurate representations of site conditions and unanticipated changes in the project execution plan;•Project modifications creating unanticipated costs or delays and failure to properly manage project modifications;•Inability to achieve guaranteed performance or quality standards with regard to engineering, construction or project management obligations;•Insufficient or inadequate project execution tools and systems needed to record, track, forecast and control cost and schedule;•Reliance on historic cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current economic and/or execution conditions;•Failure to accurately estimate the cost of projects, including due to unforeseen increases in the cost of labor;•Unanticipated increases in the cost of raw materials, components or equipment, including due to the imposition of import tariffs;•Failure to properly make judgments in accordance with applicable professional standards, including engineering standards;•Failure to properly assess and update appropriate risk mitigation strategies and measures;•Difficulties related to the performance of our clients, partners, subcontractors, suppliers or other third parties;•Delays or productivity issues caused by weather; and•Changes in local laws or difficulties or delays in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals.These and other risks may result in our failure to achieve contractual cost or schedule commitments, safety performance, overall client satisfaction or other performance criteria. As a result, we may receive lower fees or lose our ability to earn incentive fees. In other cases, our fee will not change but we will have to continue to perform work without additional fees until the performance criteria is achieved. We may also be required to pay liquidated damages if we fail to complete a project on schedule. In addition, if we fail to meet guaranteed performance or quality standards, we may be held responsible under the guarantee or warranty provisions of our contract for cost impact to the client, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or an obligation to re-perform work. To the extent these events occur, the total cost to the project (including any liquidated damages we become liable to pay) could be material and could, in some circumstances, equal or exceed the full value of the contract. In such events, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and negatively impacted.12Table of ContentsFurther, approximately 47 percent of the dollar-value of our backlog is currently fixed-price contracts, where we bear a significant portion of the risk for delays and cost overruns. We expect this percentage of fixed-price contracts to increase. Reimbursable contract types, such as those that include negotiated hourly billing rates, may restrict the kinds or amounts of costs that are reimbursable, therefore exposing us to the risk that we may incur certain costs in executing these contracts that are above our estimates and not recoverable from our clients.Intense competition in the global engineering, procurement and construction industry could reduce our market share and profits.We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinational companies compete. These markets can require substantial resources and investment in technology and skilled personnel. We also see a continuing influx of non-traditional competitors offering below-market pricing while accepting greater risk. Competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins, and may force us to accept contractual terms and conditions that are not normal or customary, thereby increasing the risk that we may have losses on such contracts. Intense competition is expected to continue in these markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits.From time to time, we are involved in litigation proceedings, potential liability claims and contract disputes which may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We may be subject to a variety of legal proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes in virtually every part of the world. We engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage. In addition, the nature of our business results in clients, subcontractors and suppliers occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. We have been and may in the future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make a claim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters. During times of economic uncertainty, especially with regard to our commodity-based clients, claim frequencies and amounts tend to increase.In proceedings where it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of these liabilities may exceed our policy limits. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposure, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Our professional liability coverage is on a ""claims-made"" basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a material loss for us, and materially reduce our cash available for operations.In other legal proceedings, liability claims or contract disputes, we may be covered by indemnification agreements which may at times be difficult to enforce. Even if enforceable, it may be difficult to recover under these agreements if the indemnitor does not have the ability to financially support the indemnity. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur, including for monetary damages. If we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed. For further information on matters in dispute, please see ""16. Contingencies and Commitments"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners, subcontractors or suppliers for payment or performance could have a material effect on our financial results.We occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. Similarly, we present change orders and claims to our subcontractors and suppliers. If we fail to properly provide notice or document the nature of change orders or claims, or are otherwise unsuccessful in negotiating a reasonable settlement, we could incur reduced profits, cost overruns and in some cases a loss on the project. These types of claims can often occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional cost, both direct and indirect. From time to time, these claims can be the subject of lengthy and costly proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and while unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial results.13Table of ContentsThe success of our use of teaming arrangements and joint ventures depends on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners over whom we may have little or no control, and the failure of those partners to perform their obligations could impose additional obligations on us that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.In the ordinary course of business, and as has become increasingly common in our industry, we execute specific projects and otherwise conduct certain operations through joint ventures, consortiums, partnerships and other collaborative arrangements (collectively, ""ventures""), including ICA Fluor and COOEC Fluor Heavy Industries (""CFHI""). We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically being proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with the third party client; however, services may be performed directly by the venture, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof.Our success in many of our markets is dependent, in part, on the presence or capability of a local partner. If we are unable to compete alone, or with a quality partner, our ability to win work and successfully complete our contracts may be impacted. Differences in opinions or views between venture partners can result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues which could adversely affect the business and operations of our ventures. In many of the countries in which we engage in joint ventures, it may be difficult to enforce our contractual rights under the applicable joint venture agreement.At times, we also participate in ventures where we are not a controlling party or where we team with unaffiliated parties on a particular project bid. In such instances, we may have limited control over venture decisions and actions, including internal controls and financial reporting which may have an impact on our business. If internal control problems arise within the joint venture, or if our joint venture partners have financial or operational issues, there could be a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The success of these and other ventures also depends, in large part, on the satisfactory performance by our venture partners of their venture obligations, including their obligation to commit working capital, equity or credit support as required by the venture and to support their indemnification and other contractual obligations. If our venture partners fail to satisfactorily perform their venture obligations, the venture may be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances, we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery by the venture of the contracted services and to meet any performance guarantees. From time to time, in order to establish or preserve a relationship, or to better ensure venture success, we may accept risks or responsibilities for the venture which are not necessarily proportionate with the reward we expect to receive or which may differ from risks or responsibilities we would normally accept in our own operations. We may also be subject to joint and several liability for our venture partners under the applicable contracts for venture projects. These additional obligations could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, increased liabilities or significant losses for us with respect to the venture, and in turn, our business and operations. In addition, a failure by a venture partner to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension or, in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Cyber-security breaches of our systems and information technology could adversely impact our ability to operate.We utilize, develop, install and maintain a number of information technology systems both for us and for others. Various privacy and security laws require us to protect sensitive and confidential information from disclosure. In addition, we are bound by our client and other contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information (whether it be ours or a third party's information entrusted to us) from disclosure. Our computer systems, as well as those of our clients, contractors and other vendors, face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, viruses, malicious code, cyber attacks, phishing and other security incursions and system disruptions, including attempts to improperly access our confidential and proprietary information as well as the confidential and proprietary information of our clients and other business partners. While we endeavor to maintain industry-accepted security measures and technology to secure our computer systems and while we endeavor to ensure our cloud vendors that store our data maintain similar measures, these systems and the information stored on these systems may still be subject to threats. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Further, as these security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to protect, prevent, detect and respond against such threats. A party who circumvents our security measures, or those of our clients, contractors or other vendors, could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, improperly manipulate data, or cause damage or interruptions to systems. Any of these events could damage our reputation, result in litigation and regulatory fines and penalties, or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, while we maintain insurance that specifically covers cyber-security threats, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.14Table of ContentsWe have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties and risks. Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.Our business is subject to international economic and political conditions that change (sometimes frequently) for reasons which are beyond our control. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 71 percent of our backlog consisted of revenue to be derived from projects and services to be completed outside the United States. We expect that a significant portion of our revenue and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeable future.Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:•abrupt changes in government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;•embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;•restrictions on currency movement;•tax or tariff increases;•currency exchange rate fluctuations;•changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including logistical and communication challenges;•U.S. government trade or other policy changes in relation to the foreign countries in which we or our clients operate;•other social, political and economic instability, including recessions and other economic crises in other regions;•expropriation and nationalization of our assets in a foreign country;•international hostilities; and•unrest, civil strife, acts of war, terrorism and insurrection.Also, the lack of a well-developed legal system in some of the countries where we operate may make it difficult to enforce our contractual rights or to defend ourself against claims made by others. We operate in locations where there is a significant amount of political risk. In addition, military action or continued unrest could impact the supply or pricing of oil, disrupt our operations in the region and elsewhere, and increase our security costs. Our level of exposure to these risks will vary on each project, depending on the location of the project and the particular stage of each such project. For example, our risk exposure with respect to a project in an early development phase, such as engineering, will generally be less than our risk exposure on a project that is in the construction phase. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and political conditions and risks, we may experience project disruptions and losses. Project disruptions and losses could significantly reduce our overall revenue and profits.In addition, the 2016 referendum by the British voters to exit the European Union, commonly referred to as ""Brexit,"" adversely impacted global markets, including currencies, and resulted in the weakening of the British pound against other currencies. A weaker British pound compared to the U.S. dollar during a reporting period causes local currency results of our United Kingdom operations and contracts, denominated in the British pound, to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars. Volatility in exchange rates may continue as the U.K. negotiates its exit from the E.U. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our international operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations and could adversely affect our results of operations.Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and, therefore, may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or earnings.As of December 31, 2018, our backlog was approximately $40 billion. Our backlog generally consists of projects for which we have an executed contract or commitment with a client and reflects our expected revenue from the contract or commitment, which is often subject to revision over time. We cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable or will not be subject to delay or suspension. Project cancellations, scope adjustments or deferrals, or foreign currency fluctuations may occur with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn; or, may cause the rate at which we perform on our backlog to decrease. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them allowing clients to cancel projects already awarded to us. Our contracts typically provide for the payment of fees earned through the date of termination and the reimbursement of costs incurred including demobilization costs. In addition, projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. During periods of economic slowdown, or decreases and/or instability in commodity prices, the risk of backlog projects being suspended, delayed 15Table of Contentsor canceled generally increases. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business and our profits.Our employees work on projects that are inherently dangerous and in locations where there are high security risks, and a failure to maintain a safe work site could result in significant losses.We often work on complex projects, frequently in geographically remote or high risk locations that are subject to political, social or economic risks, or war or civil unrest. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may expend significant efforts and incur substantial security costs to maintain the safety of our personnel. In addition, our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment, dangerous processes or substances or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation and performance. Often, we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. Many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts, and some of our contract fees or profits are subject to satisfying safety criteria. Unsafe work conditions also have the potential of increasing employee turnover, increasing project costs and raising our operating costs. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries or even loss of life, the completion of a project could be delayed and we could experience investigations or litigation. Although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our company, the failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability. Despite these activities, in these locations and at these sites, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel, nor can we guarantee our work, equipment or supplies will be free from damage.Our businesses could be materially and adversely affected by events outside of our control.Extraordinary or force majeure events beyond our control, such as natural or man-made disasters, could negatively impact our ability to operate or increase our costs to operate. As an example, from time to time we face unexpected severe weather conditions which may result in delays in our operations; evacuation of personnel and curtailment of services; increased labor and material costs or shortages; inability to deliver materials, equipment and personnel to jobsites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. We may remain obligated to perform our services after any such natural or man-made disasters, unless a contract provision provides us with relief from our obligations. The extra costs incurred as a result of these events may not be reimbursed by our clients. If we are not able to react quickly to such events, or if a high concentration of our projects are in a specific geographic region that suffers from a natural or man-made disaster, our operations may be significantly affected, which could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, if we cannot complete our contracts on time, we may be subject to potential liability claims by our clients which may reduce our profits and result in losses.Our U.S. government contracts and contracting rights may be terminated or otherwise adversely impacted at any time, and our inability to win or renew government contracts during regulated procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our projects and revenues.We enter into significant government contracts from time to time, such as those contracts that we have in place with the U.S. Department of Energy and Department of Defense. U.S. government contracts are subject to various uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by government representatives and profit and cost controls, which could result in withholding or delay of payments to us. U.S. government contracts are also subject to uncertainties associated with Congressional funding, including the potential impacts of budget deficits, government shutdowns and federal sequestration. A significant portion of our business is derived as a result of U.S. government regulatory, military and infrastructure priorities. Changes in these priorities, which can occur due to policy changes or changes in the economy, could adversely impact our revenues. The U.S. government is under no obligation to maintain program funding at any specific level, and funds for a program may even be eliminated. Our U.S. government clients may terminate or decide not to renew our contracts with little or no prior notice.In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to specific regulations such as the Federal Acquisition Regulation (""FAR""), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards (""CAS""), the Service Contract Act and Department of Defense security regulations. Failure to comply with any of these regulations and other government requirements may result in contract price adjustments, financial penalties or contract termination. Our U.S. government contracts are also subject to audits, cost reviews and investigations by U.S. government contracting oversight agencies such as the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (the ""DCAA""). The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and our compliance with, our internal control systems and policies (including our labor, billing, accounting, purchasing, estimating, compensation and management information systems). The DCAA also has the ability to review how we have accounted for costs under the FAR and CAS. The DCAA presents its report findings to the Defense Contract Management Agency (""DCMA""). Should the DCMA determine that we have not complied with the terms of our contract and applicable statutes and regulations, or if they believe that we have engaged in inappropriate accounting or other activities, payments to us may be disallowed or we could be required to refund previously collected payments. Additionally, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, suspension or debarment from future government contracts, and qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the U.S. government under the False Claims Act, which could include claims for treble 16Table of Contentsdamages. Furthermore, in this environment, if we have significant disagreements with our government clients concerning costs incurred, negative publicity could arise which could adversely affect our industry reputation and our ability to compete for new contracts in the government arena or otherwise.Most U.S. government contracts are awarded through a rigorous competitive process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied upon multiple-year contracts with pre-established terms and conditions that generally require those contractors that have been previously awarded the contract to engage in an additional competitive bidding process for each task order issued under the contract. Such processes require successful contractors to anticipate requirements and develop rapid-response bid and proposal teams as well as dedicated supplier relationships and delivery systems to react to these needs. We face rigorous competition and significant pricing pressures in order to win these task orders. If we are not successful in reducing costs or able to timely respond to government requests, we may not win additional awards. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may not be awarded the contract because of existing government policies designed to protect small businesses and under- represented minority contractors. Our inability to win or renew government contracts during the procurement processes could harm our operations and reduce our profits and revenues.Many of our U.S. government contracts require security clearances. Depending upon the level of clearance required, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. If we or our employees are unable to obtain or retain necessary security clearances, we may not be able to win new business, and our existing government clients could terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew them, thus adversely affecting our revenues.Under the Budget Control Act of 2011, an automatic sequestration process, or across-the-board budget cuts (a large portion of which were defense-related), was triggered when the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, a committee of twelve members of Congress, failed to agree on a deficit reduction plan for the U.S. federal budget. The sequestration began on March 1, 2013. Although the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, and the subsequent Balanced Budget Acts of 2015 and 2018, have provided some sequester relief until the end of 2019, the Budget Control Act of 2011 remains in place, extended through 2027, and absent additional legislative or other remedial action, the sequestration could require reduced U.S. federal government spending from 2020 through 2027. A significant reduction in federal government spending or a change in budgetary priorities could reduce demand for our services, cancel or delay federal projects, and result in the closure of federal facilities and significant personnel reductions, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.If one or more of our U.S. government contracts are terminated for any reason including for convenience, if we are suspended or debarred from U.S. government contract work, or if payment of our cost is disallowed, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenue and profits.If we experience delays and/or defaults in client payments, we could suffer liquidity problems or we could be unable to recover all expenditures.Because of the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from clients in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures as they are incurred. Some of our clients may find it increasingly difficult to pay invoices for our services timely, especially as commodity prices are volatile or relatively low, increasing the risk that our accounts receivable could become uncollectible and ultimately be written off. In certain cases, our clients for our large projects are project-specific entities that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project. From time to time, it may be difficult for us to collect payments owed to us by these clients. In addition, clients may request extension of the payment terms otherwise agreed to under our contracts. Delays in client payments may require us to make a working capital investment, which could impact our cash flows and liquidity. If a client fails to pay invoices on a timely basis or defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devoted significant resources, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity.We are dependent upon suppliers and subcontractors to complete many of our contracts.Some of the work performed under our contracts is performed by third-party subcontractors. We also rely on third-party suppliers to provide much of the equipment and materials used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or find qualified suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a fixed-price type contract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, technology, equipment or services as required under a contract to us, our joint venture partner, our client or any other party involved in the project for any reason, or provides supplies, technology, equipment or services that are not an acceptable quality, we may be required to source those supplies, technology, equipment or services on a delayed basis or at a higher price than anticipated, which could impact contract profitability. In addition, faulty workmanship, equipment or materials could impact the overall project, resulting in claims against us for failure to meet required project specifications. These risks may be intensified during an economic downturn if these suppliers or subcontractors experience financial difficulties or find it difficult to obtain sufficient financing to fund their operations or access to bonding, and are not able to provide the services or supplies necessary for our business. In addition, in instances where we rely 17Table of Contentson a single contracted supplier or subcontractor or a small number of suppliers or subcontractors, if a subcontractor or supplier were to fail, there can be no assurance that the marketplace can provide replacement technology, equipment, materials or services on a timely basis or at the costs we had anticipated. A failure by a third-party subcontractor or supplier to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could negatively impact our business and reputation and could result in fines, penalties, suspension, or in the case of government contracts, even debarment.Our actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements.In preparing our financial statements, we are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to make estimates and assumptions as of the date of the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Areas requiring significant estimates by our management include:•recognition of contract revenue, costs, profits or losses in applying the principles of percentage-of-completion accounting;•recognition of revenues related to project incentives or awards we expect to receive;•recognition of recoveries under contract change orders or claims;•estimated amounts for expected project losses, warranty costs, contract close-out or other costs;•collectability of billed and unbilled accounts receivable and the need and amount of any allowance for doubtful accounts;•asset valuations;•income tax provisions and related valuation allowances;•determination of expense and potential liabilities under pension and other post-retirement benefit programs; and•accruals for other estimated liabilities, including litigation and insurance revenues/reserves.Estimates are based on management's reasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Our actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates of such results due to changes in facts and circumstances, which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and reported results of operations. Further, we are required to record contract revenue as work on a contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at any point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenues that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the period when such estimates are revised. Such adjustments could be material and could result in reduced profitability.Changes in our effective tax rate and tax positions may vary.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country in which we operate could result in a lower or higher tax rate on our earnings, which could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows from operations. For example, recently enacted tax reform legislation in the U.S. could significantly impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our determinations could be found to be incorrect. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions. Future increases in our tax rate or adverse changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and liquidity.Systems and information technology interruption, as well as new systems implementation, could adversely impact our ability to operate and our operating results.As a global company, we are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers, in order to operate. From time to time, we experience system interruptions and delays that may be planned for upgrades or that may be unplanned. Unplanned interruptions include natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause system interruptions, delays, loss of critical or sensitive data (including personal or financial data) or loss of funds; could delay or prevent operations (including the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results); and could adversely affect our reputation or our operating results. While we have and require the maintenance of reasonable safeguards designed to protect against unavailability or loss of data, these safeguards may not be 18Table of Contentssufficient. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and cash flows.We continue to evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. Our systems implementations also may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated. Systems implementation disruption and any other information technology disruption, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business.We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We train our personnel concerning anti-bribery laws and issues, and we also inform our partners, subcontractors, suppliers, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that they must comply with anti-bribery law requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance. However, there is no assurance that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, agents, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if ultimately such litigation or investigations demonstrate that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business.We could be adversely impacted if we fail to comply with domestic and international import and export laws.Our global operations require importing and exporting goods and technology across international borders on a regular basis. Our policies mandate strict compliance with U.S. and foreign international trade laws. To the extent we export technical services, data and products outside of the United States, we are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations governing international trade and exports including but not limited to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of Treasury. From time to time, we identify certain inadvertent or potential export or related violations. These violations may include, for example, transfers without required governmental authorization. A failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines, the denial of export privileges, and suspension or debarment from participation in U.S. government contracts.Employee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits.Misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with anti-corruption, export control and environmental regulations; federal procurement regulations, regulations regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts and regulations regarding the protection of sensitive government information; regulations on lobbying or similar activities; regulations pertaining to the internal control over financial reporting; and various other applicable laws or regulations. The precautions we take to prevent and detect fraud, misconduct or failures to comply with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of fraud or misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance and suspension or debarment from contracting with government agencies, which could weaken our ability to win contracts and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profits.Adverse credit and financial market conditions could impair our, our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which could negatively affect our business operations, profits and growth objectives.Our ongoing ability to generate cash is important for the funding of our continuing operations, investing in joint ventures, the servicing of our indebtedness, paying dividends to stockholders and making acquisitions. To the extent that existing cash balances and cash flow from operations, together with borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities, are insufficient to make investments or acquisitions or provide needed working capital, we may require additional financing from other sources. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, as well as 19Table of Contentsconditions in our business and our operating results; and those factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Furthermore, if global economic, political or other market conditions adversely affect the financial institutions which provide credit to us, it is possible that our ability to draw upon our credit facilities may be impacted. If adequate funds are not available, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges.In addition, adverse credit and financial market conditions could also adversely affect our clients' and our partners' borrowing capacity, which support the continuation and expansion of projects worldwide, and could result in contract cancellations or suspensions, project award and execution delays, payment delays or defaults by our clients. These disruptions could materially impact our backlog and profits. If we extend a significant portion of credit to our clients or projects in a specific geographic region or industry, we may experience higher levels of collection risk or non-payment if those clients are impacted by factors specific to their geographic industry or region. Finally, our business has traditionally lagged recoveries in the general economy, and therefore may not recover as quickly as the economy as a whole.It can be very difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.As part of business operations we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future, or that such insurance can be economically secured. For example, catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits, more limited coverage, increased premium costs or deductibles. We also monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we procure insurance, and this is one of the factors we take into account when purchasing insurance. Our insurance is purchased from a number of the world's leading providers, often in layered insurance or quota share arrangements. If any of our third party insurers fail, abruptly cancel our coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us, then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted.New or changing legal requirements, including those relating to climate change, could adversely affect our operating results.Our business and results of operations could be affected by the passage of climate change, defense, environmental, infrastructure, trade and other laws, policies and regulations. For example, growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional environmental regulations. Legislation, international protocols or treaties, regulation or other restrictions on emissions could affect our clients, including those who (a) are involved in the exploration, production or refining of fossil fuels such as our energy and chemicals clients, (b) emit greenhouse gases through the combustion of fossil fuels, including some of our power business clients or (c) emit greenhouse gases through the mining, manufacture, utilization or production of materials or goods. Such legislation or restrictions could increase the costs of projects for us and our clients or, in some cases, prevent a project from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our services which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. However, legislation and regulation regarding climate change could also increase the pace of development of carbon capture and storage projects, alternative transportation, alternative energy facilities, such as wind farms or nuclear reactors, or incentivize increased implementation of clean fuel projects which could positively impact the demand for our services. As another example, the implementation of trade barriers, countervailing duties, or border taxes, or the addition, relaxation or repeal of laws, policies and regulations regarding the industries and sectors in which we work could result in a decline in demand for our services, or may make the manner in which we perform our services, especially from outside the United States, less cost efficient. Furthermore, changes to existing trade agreements may impact our business operations. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us and our clients.Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional cost on us that reduce our profits.We are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations. Our projects can involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials, including nuclear and other radioactive materials, which, if improperly handled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. It is impossible to reliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations. The applicable regulations, as well as the length of time available to comply with those regulations, continue to develop and change. The cost of complying with rulings and regulations, satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which we are found responsible, or satisfying claims or judgments alleging personal injury, property damage or natural resource damages as a result of exposure to, or contamination by, hazardous materials, including as a result of commodities such as lead or asbestos-related products, could be substantial, may not be covered by insurance, could reduce our profits, and therefore, could materially impact our future operations.20Table of ContentsOur company, along with our investment in NuScale, is subject to a number of regulations such as those from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and non-U.S. regulatory bodies, such as the International Atomic Energy Commission and the European Union, which can have a substantial effect on our nuclear operations and investments. Delays in receiving necessary approvals, permits or licenses, the failure to maintain sufficient compliance programs, and other problems encountered during construction (including changes to such regulatory requirements) could significantly increase our costs or have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our return on investments, our financial position and our cash flow.A substantial portion of our business is generated either directly or indirectly as a result of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations related to environmental matters. A reduction in the number or scope of these laws or regulations, or changes in government policies regarding the funding, implementation or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could significantly reduce the size of one of our markets and limit our opportunities for growth or reduce our revenue below current levels.If we do not have adequate indemnification for our nuclear services, it could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We provide services to the U.S. Department of Energy and the nuclear energy industry in the on-going maintenance and modification of nuclear facilities as well as decontamination and decommissioning activities of nuclear plants. The Price-Anderson Act generally indemnifies parties performing services to nuclear power plants and Department of Energy contractors; however, not all activities we engage in on behalf of our clients are covered. Thus, if the Price-Anderson Act indemnification protections do not apply to our services, or if the exposure occurs outside of the United States in a region that does not have protections comparable to the Price-Anderson Act, our business and financial condition could be adversely affected by our client's refusal to contract with us, by our inability to obtain commercially reasonable insurance or third party indemnification, or by the potentially significant monetary damages we could incur.Foreign currency risks could have an adverse impact on company revenue, earnings and/or backlog.Certain of our contracts subject us to foreign currency risk, particularly when project contract revenue is denominated in a currency different than the contract costs. In addition, our operational cash flows and cash balances, though predominately held in U.S. dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our project contracts globally and meet transactional requirements. We may attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency risk by obtaining contract provisions that protect us from foreign currency fluctuations and/or by implementing hedging strategies utilizing derivatives as hedging instruments. However, these actions may not always eliminate all foreign currency risk, and as a result, our profitability on certain projects could be affected.Our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies are subject to currency fluctuations when measured period to period for financial reporting purposes. In addition, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly due to foreign currency volatility. We may also be exposed to limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund our operations in other countries.The company's reported revenue and earnings of foreign subsidiaries could also be affected by foreign currency volatility. Revenue, cost and earnings of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. If the U.S. dollar appreciates against a foreign subsidiary's non-U.S. dollar functional currency, the company would report less revenue, cost and earnings in U.S. dollars than it would have had the U.S. dollar depreciated against the same foreign currency or if there had been no change in the exchange rate.Our continued success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.The success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract and retain personnel, including engineers, project management and craft employees around the globe, who have the necessary and required experience and expertise, and who will perform these services at a reasonable and competitive rate. Competition for these and other experienced personnel is intense. It may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded by our clients. In certain geographic areas, for example, we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel. Also, it may be difficult to replace personnel who hold government granted eligibility that may be required to obtain certain government projects and/or who have significant government contract experience.As some of our executives and other key personnel approach retirement age, we need to provide for smooth transitions, which may require that we devote time and resources to identify and integrate new personnel into these leadership roles and other key positions. If we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of skilled personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans, our ability to pursue projects may be adversely affected, the costs of executing our existing and future projects may increase and our financial performance may decline.21Table of ContentsIn addition, the cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. For example, the uncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size with our contracts. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costs resulting from excess staff, reductions in staff, or redundancy of facilities that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.The loss of one or a few clients could have an adverse effect on us.A few clients, including the U.S. government, state governments and U.S. and state government agencies, have in the past, and may in the future, account for a significant portion of our revenues in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years, either directly or through participation in a joint venture that serves as a client. See ""Item 1. — Business — Other Matters — Significant Clients"" for more information. Although we have long-standing relationships with many of our significant clients, our clients may unilaterally reduce, fail to renew or terminate their contracts with us at any time. Most of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them. The loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Damage to our reputation could in turn cause damage to our business.Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining our clients and other business relationships. If we fail to address issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business. These issues may include, but are not limited to, any of the risk factors discussed in this Item 1A, including compliance with laws, project execution risk, cyber security and safety. If our reputation is harmed, we could suffer a number of adverse consequences, such as:•reduced demand for our services;•lack of investor confidence;•less favorable credit rating;•the inability to attract and retain qualified employees;•a loss or reduction in scope of current project contracts and fewer contract awards;•less favorable contract terms;•increased litigation and costs; and•heightened regulatory scrutiny.These and other consequences resulting from damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may be unable to win new contract awards if we cannot provide clients with letters of credit, bonds or other security or credit enhancements.In certain of our business lines it is industry practice for clients to require surety bonds, letters of credit, bank guarantees or other forms of credit enhancement. Surety bonds, letters of credit or guarantees indemnify our clients if we fail to perform our obligations under our contracts. Historically, we have had strong surety bonding capacity due to our industry leading credit rating, but, bonding is provided at the surety's sole discretion. In addition, because of the overall limitations in worldwide bonding capacity, we may find it difficult to find sufficient surety bonding capacity to meet our total surety bonding needs. With regard to letters of credit, while we have had adequate capacity under our existing credit facilities, any capacity that may be required in excess of our credit limits would be at our lenders' sole discretion and therefore is not certain. Failure to provide credit enhancements on terms required by a client may result in an inability to compete for or win a project.Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to adequately protect intellectual property rights.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to differentiate our services through our technologies and know-how. This success includes the ability of companies in which we invest, such as NuScale, to protect their intellectual property rights. We rely principally on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to protect our interests. However, these methods only provide a limited amount of protection and may not adequately protect our interests. Our employees, contractors and joint venture partners are subject to confidentiality obligations, but this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information and/or infringement of our intellectual property rights. This can be especially true in certain foreign countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or when our joint venture partner is a competitor who will gain access to our procedures and know-how while working with us in the performance of services.22Table of ContentsOur clients require broad ownership rights in the work product and other materials we deliver. If we are not able to retain ownership of our pre-existing intellectual property and improvements thereto, it may affect our ability to provide similar services to other clients in the future, which ultimately, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.We cannot provide assurances that others will not independently develop technology substantially similar to our trade secret technology or that we can successfully preserve our intellectual property rights in the future. Our intellectual property rights could be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or infringed upon. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business.In addition, our clients or other third parties may also provide us with their technology and intellectual property. There is a risk that we may not sufficiently protect our or their information from improper use or dissemination and, as a result, could be subject to claims and litigation and resulting liabilities, loss of contracts or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.We also hold licenses from third parties which may be utilized in our business operations. If we are no longer able to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected. When we license our intellectual property to third parties, the scope of such license grant is limited to a particular plant or project. If such third party exceeds the scope of the license grant, and if we are unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights, our revenue and margins will be adversely impacted, and the value of our intellectual property portfolio may decline thereby adversely affecting our competitive advantage and ability to win future work.Any acquisitions, dispositions or other investments may present risks or uncertainties.We have made and expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions or dispositions of businesses, or investments in strategic business opportunities. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or investments, or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that such transactions will be successful. Acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted or jurisdictions where we have had little to no prior operations experience and thus expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have traditionally experienced. We also may encounter difficulties identifying all significant risks during our due diligence activities or integrating acquisitions and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions. We may not be able to successfully cause a buyer of a divested business to assume the liabilities of that business or, even if such liabilities are assumed, we may have difficulties enforcing our rights, contractual or otherwise, against the buyer. We may invest in companies or businesses that fail, causing a loss of all or part of our investment. Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of asset impairments.Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by impairments to goodwill, investments, deferred tax assets or other intangible assets. For example, when we acquire a business, we record goodwill in an amount equal to the amount we paid for the business minus the fair value of the net tangible assets and other intangible assets of the acquired business. Goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives cannot be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment. For additional description on this impairment testing, please see ""1. Major Accounting Policies"" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Any future impairments, including impairments of goodwill, investments, deferred tax assets or other intangible assets, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized.In addition, if we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for a company in which we have invested, we may have to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. For cases in which we are required under the equity method or the proportionate consolidation method of accounting to recognize a proportionate share of another company's income or loss, such income or loss may impact our earnings.Although we expect to realize certain benefits as a result of our acquisitions and investments, there is a possibility that we may be unable to successfully integrate our businesses or capitalize upon our investments in order to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions and investments or do so within the intended timeframe.Whenever we make an acquisition or investment, we have and will continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating or aligning the business practices and operations of companies we acquire or invest in. Difficulties we may encounter in the integration/alignment process include:•A delay in the integration or alignment of management teams, strategies, operations, products and services;•Diversion of the attention of management as a result of the acquisition or investment;23Table of Contents•The consequences of a change in tax treatment, including the costs of integration/consolidation and compliance, and the possibility that the anticipated benefits of the acquisition/investment will not be realized;•Differences in corporate culture and management philosophies;•The ability to retain key personnel;•The challenges of integrating or aligning complex systems, technology, networks and other assets into or to be compatible with ours in a way that minimizes any adverse effects on the business; and•Potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the acquisition or investment, including the costs to integrate or consolidate beyond current estimates.Any of these factors could affect each company's ability to maintain business relationships or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or investment, or could reduce our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.In the event we make acquisitions using our stock as consideration, stockholders' ownership percentages would be diluted.We intend to grow our business not only organically but also potentially through acquisitions. One method of paying for acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporate initiatives is through the issuance of additional equity securities. If we do issue additional equity securities, the issuance would have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and stockholders' percentage ownership.Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.Fluor is a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law impose impediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our charters and bylaws may impede or discourage a takeover. For example:•stockholders may not act by written consent;•there are various restrictions on the ability of a stockholder to call a special meeting or to nominate a director for election; and•our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preferred shares.These types of provisions in our charters and bylaws could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares"

We bear the risk of cost overruns in approximately 32% of the dollar-value of our contracts. Wemay experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increaseabove our estimates.     We conduct our business under various types of contractual arrangements. In terms ofdollar-value, the majority of our contracts allocate the risk of cost overruns to our client byrequiring our client to reimburse us for our costs. Approximately 32% of the dollar-value of ourcontracts, however, are guaranteed maximum price or fixed price contracts, where we bear asignificant portion of the risk for cost overruns. Under these fixed price contracts, contractprices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates which are based on a number ofassumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions, prices and availability oflabor, equipment and materials, and other exigencies. If these estimates prove inaccurate, orcircumstances change such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits orapprovals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, cost of raw materials, oursuppliers or subcontractors inability to perform, cost overruns may occur, and we couldexperience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. From time to time, we mayalso assume a projects technical risk, which means that we may have to satisfy certain technicalrequirements of a project despite the fact that at the time of project award, we may not havepreviously produced the system or product in question.Our backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertainindicator of our future earnings.     As of December 31, 2005, our backlog was approximately $14.9 billion. We cannot guaranteethat the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result inprofits. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, projectcancellations or scope adjustments may occur, from time to time, with respect to contractsreflected in our backlog. Backlog reductions can adversely affect the revenue and profit weactually receive from contracts reflected in our backlog. Future project cancellations and scopeadjustments could further reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenues and profits thatwe actually receive. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our profits.If we guarantee the timely completion or performance standards of a project, we could incuradditional costs to cover our guarantee obligations.     In some instances and in many of our fixed price contracts, we guarantee a customer that wewill complete a project by a scheduled date. We sometimes provide that the project, whencompleted, will also achieve certain performance standards. If we subsequently fail to completethe project as scheduled, or if the project subsequently fails to meet guaranteed performancestandards, we may be held responsible for cost impacts to the client resulting from any delay orthe costs to cause the project to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form ofcontractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. To the extent that these events occur, the totalcosts of the project would exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profitsor, in some cases, a loss for that project.The nature of our engineering and construction business exposes us to potential liability claimsand contract disputes which may reduce our profits.     We engage in engineering and construction activities for large facilities where design,construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties. Wehave been and may in future be named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may make aclaim for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters. These claimsgenerally arise in the normal course of our business. When it is determined that we haveliability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of theseliabilities may exceed our policy limits. Our professional liability coverage is on aclaims-made basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently ineffect. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposures, the policies havedeductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any suchclaims. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits or, ifcovered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for us,which claims may reduce our profits and cash available for operations.11Table of ContentsWe have seen an increase in our claims against project owners for payment and our failure torecover adequately on these and future claims could have a material effect on us.     We have over the past few years seen an increase in the volume and the amount of claimsbrought by us against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or foramounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matterssuch as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additionalcosts, both direct and indirect. Often, these claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration orlitigation proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will befully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we have usedsignificant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of therelevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a materialadverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.We are vulnerable to the cyclical nature of the markets we serve.     The demand for our services and products is dependent upon the existence of projects withengineering, procurement, construction and management needs. Although downturns can impact ourentire business, our telecommunications and power markets exemplify businesses that are cyclical innature and have recently been affected by a decrease in worldwide demand for these projects.Industries such as these and many of the others we serve have historically been and will continueto be vulnerable to general downturns and are cyclical in nature. As a result, our past resultshave varied considerably and may continue to vary depending upon the demand for future projects inthese industries.Our continued success requires us to hire and retain qualified personnel.     Over the past year, the demand for employees who engage and are experienced in the services weperform has grown as our customers have increased their capital expenditures and the use of ourservices. The success of our business is dependent upon being able to attract and retainpersonnel, including executive, management and craft employees, who have the necessary and requiredexperience and expertise. In addition, we are moving our corporate headquarters to Irving, Texasfrom Southern California in the spring. While we have asked a large number of employees torelocate to Irving, we may suffer some employee losses for those employees who elect not to movewhich could in turn have an impact on our public company reporting and other corporate activities.If we cannot find and keep the employees necessary to execute our contracts or to perform necessarycorporate activities, it could have a material adverse impact on our business or financial results.Our use of the percentage-of-completion method of accounting could result in a reduction orreversal of previously recorded revenues or profits.     Under our accounting procedures, we measure and recognize a large portion of our profits andrevenues under the percentage of completion accounting methodology. This methodology allows us torecognize revenues and profits ratably over the life of a contract by comparing the amount of thecosts incurred to date against the total amount of costs expected to be incurred. The effect ofrevisions to revenues and estimated costs is recorded when the amounts are known and can bereasonably estimated, and these revisions can occur at any time and could be material. On ahistorical basis, we believe that we have made reasonably reliable estimates of the progresstowardscompletion on our long term contracts. However, given the uncertainties associated with thesetypes of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to vary from estimates previously made, whichmay result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.We have international operations that are subject to foreign economic and political uncertainties.Unexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in projectdisruptions, increased costs and potential losses.     Our business is subject to fluctuations in demand and to changing domestic and internationaleconomic and political conditions which are beyond our control. As of December 31, 2005,approximately 65% of our projected backlog consisted of engineering and construction revenues to bederived from facilities to be constructed in other12Table of Contentscountries; we expect that a significant portionof our revenues and profits will continue to come from international projects for the foreseeablefuture.     Operating in the international marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:  abrupt changes in foreign government policies and regulations,   embargoes,   trade restrictions;   tax increases;   United States government policies, and   international hostilities.     The lack of a well-developed legal system in some of these countries may make it difficult toenforce our contractual rights. We also face significant risks due to civil strife, acts of war,terrorism and insurrection. Our level of exposure to these risks will vary with respect to eachproject, depending on the particular stage of each such project. For example, our risk exposurewith respect to a project in an early development stage will generally be less than our riskexposure with respect to a project in the middle of construction. To the extent that ourinternational business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic and politicalconditions, we may experience project disruptions and losses. Project disruptions and losses couldsignificantly reduce our revenues and profits.Our government contracts may be terminated at any time. Also, if we do not comply withrestrictions and regulations imposed by the government, our government contracts may be terminatedand we may be unable to enter into future government contracts. The termination of our governmentcontracts could significantly reduce our expected revenues.     We enter into significant government contracts, from time to time, such as those that we havewith the U.S. Department of Energy at Fernald and Hanford. Government contracts are subject tovarious uncertainties, restrictions and regulations, including oversight audits by governmentrepresentatives and profit and cost controls. Government contracts are also exposed touncertainties associated with Congressional funding. The government is under no obligation tomaintain funding at any specific level and funds for a program may even be eliminated.     In addition, government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations and avariety of other socio-economic requirements. For example, we must comply with the FederalAcquisition Regulation (FAR), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Cost Accounting Standards(CAS), the Service Contract Act and Department of Defense security regulations. We must alsocomply with various other government regulations and requirements as well as various statutesrelated to employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting. If wefail to comply with any of these regulations, requirements or statutes, our existing governmentcontracts could be terminated, and we could be temporarily suspended or even debarred fromgovernment contracting or subcontracting.     We also run the risk of the impact of government audits, investigations and proceedings, andso-called qui tam actions brought by individuals or the government under the Federal False ClaimsAct that, if an unfavorable result occurs, could impact our profits and financial condition, aswell as our ability to obtain future government work. For example, government agencies such as theU.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (the DCAA) routinely review and audit government contractors.If these agencies determine that a rule or regulation has been violated, a variety of penalties canbe imposed including criminal and civil penalties all of which would harm our reputation with thegovernment or even debar us from future government activities. The DCAA has the ability to reviewhow we have accounted for costs under the FAR and CAS, and if they believe that we have engaged ininappropriate accounting or other activities, payments to us may be disallowed.13Table of Contents     If one or more of our government contracts are terminated for any reason including forconvenience, if we are suspended from government contract work, or if payment of our costs isdisallowed, we could suffer a significant reduction in expected revenues and profits.Some of our projects and new business may be located in environments where anti-corruptioninitiatives are not followed.     We often perform our projects in countries with less robust legal systems or which are in thedevelopmental stage. Transparency International, an international organization which reviewspotential governmental and institutional corruption, has rated many of the countries poorly interms of their acceptance of corruption and their enforcement of anti-corruption laws and rules.It is the policy of the company to comply with all applicable anti-bribery laws such as the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act (the FCPA) of the United States and the applicable laws of all foreigncountries in which we operate. Under the FCPA, among other things, U.S.-based companies such asFluor and our agents or other intermediaries are precluded from offering anything of value toforeign officials or governments with the intent of obtaining or retaining business, or tootherwise obtain an improper advantage. We train our staff concerning FCPA issues, and we alsoinform our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf that theymust comply with FCPA requirements. We also have procedures and controls in place to monitorinternal and external compliance. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due toour own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer fromcriminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.We work in international locations where there are high security risks, which could result in harmto our employees or unanticipated costs.     Some of our services are performed in high risk locations, such as Iraq, where the country orlocation is suffering from political, social or economic issues, or war or civil unrest. In thoselocations where we have employees or operations, we may incur substantial costs such as securitycosts to maintain the safety of our personnel. Moreover, despite these activities, in theselocations, we cannot guarantee the safety of our personnel.We continue to expand our business in areas where bonding is required, but bonding capacity islimited.     We continue to expand our business in areas where the underlying contract must be bonded,especially in the transportation infrastructure arena. Because of the overall lack of worldwidebonding capacity, we can find it difficult to find sureties who will provide the contract-requiredbonding. In addition, these contracts are often very large and extremely complex, which oftennecessitates the use of a joint venture, often with a competitor, to bid on and perform these typesof contracts, especially since it may be easier to jointly pursue the necessary bonding. However,entering into these types of joint ventures or partnerships exposes us to the credit andperformance risks of third parties, many of whom are not as financially strong as we are. If ourjoint venturers or partners fail to perform, we could suffer negative results.It can be very difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations.     As part of business operations, we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk managementstrategy and in order to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts. Insurance productshave become increasingly expensive andsometimes very difficult to obtain. Although we have in the past been generally able tocover our insurance needs, there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary orappropriate insurance in the future.Our international operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could increase ourU.S. dollar costs or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues.     Because our functional currency is the U.S. dollar, we generally try to denominate ourcontracts in United States dollars. However, from time to time our contracts are denominated inforeign currencies, which results in our foreign operations facing the additional risk offluctuating currency values and exchange rates, hard currency shortages and controls on currencyexchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, orreduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reducedrevenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits.14Table of ContentsIntense competition in the engineering and construction industry could reduce our market share andprofits.     We serve markets that are highly competitive and in which a large number of multinationalcompanies compete, such as the Bechtel Group, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group, Halliburtons KelloggBrown & Root, Chicago Bridge and Iron Company N.V., CH2M Hill Companies Limited, ParsonsEngineering Group, the Shaw Group and Washington Group International, and international companiessuch as Foster-Wheeler Ltd., Technip-Coflexip and AMEC plc. In particular, the engineering andconstruction markets are highly competitive and require substantial resources and capitalinvestment in equipment, technology and skilled personnel. Competition also places downwardpressure on our contract prices and profit margins. Intense competition is expected to continue inthese markets, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growthrates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, wecould lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits.The success of our joint ventures depend on the satisfactory performance by our joint venturepartners of their joint venture obligations. The failure of our joint venture partners to performtheir joint venture obligations could impose on us additional financial and performance obligationsthat could result in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us with respect tothe joint venture.     We enter into various joint ventures as part of our engineering, procurement and constructionbusinesses, such as ICA Fluor and project specific joint ventures. The success of these and otherjoint ventures depend, in large part, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partnersof its joint venture obligations. If our joint venture partners fail to satisfactorily performtheir joint venture obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties, the joint venturemay be unable to adequately perform or deliver its contracted services. Under these circumstances,we may be required to make additional investments and provide additional services to ensure theadequate performance and delivery of the contracted services. These additional obligations couldresult in reduced profits or, in some cases, significant losses for us with respect to the jointventure.We may have additional tax liabilities.     We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In theordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimatetax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although webelieve that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and relatedlitigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in our financial statements.     In addition, prior to the reverse spin-off involving our former coal segment, ourpredecessor-in-interest received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the reversespin-off qualified as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,as amended. The ruling was granted based upon certain representations made by ourpredecessor-in-interest. While we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would causethose representations to be incorrect or incomplete, if those representations were inaccurate, itis possible that the ruling would no longer be valid. In such event, we could incur a significantcorporate tax liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Past and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additionalcosts on us that reduce our profits.     We are subject to numerous environmental laws and health and safety regulations. Our projectscan involve the handling of hazardous and other highly regulated materials which, if improperlyhandled or disposed of, could subject us to civil and criminal liabilities. It is impossible toreliably predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developmentsrelating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable toour operations. The applicable regulations, as well as the technology and length of time availableto comply with those regulations, continue to develop and change. In addition, past activitiescould also have a material impact on us. For example, when we sold our mining business formerlyconducted through St. Joe Minerals Corporation, we retained responsibility for certain non-leadrelated environmental liabilities, but only to the extent that such liabilities were not covered bySt. Joes comprehensive general liability insurance. While we are15Table of Contentsnot currently aware of anymaterial exposure arising from our former St. Joes business or otherwise, the costs of complyingwith rulings and regulations or satisfying any environmental remediation requirements for which weare found responsible could be substantial and could reduce our profits.If we experience delays and/or defaults in customer payments, we could suffer liquidity problems orwe could be unable to recover all expenditures.     Because of the nature of our contracts, at times we commit resources to projects prior toreceiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on client projectsas they are incurred. Delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capitalinvestment. If a customer defaults in making its payments on a project in which we have devotedsignificant resources, it could have a material negative effect on our results of operations.Our recent and any future acquisitions may not be successful.     We expect to continue to pursue selective acquisitions of businesses. We cannot assure youthat we will be able to locate suitable acquisitions or that we will be able to consummate any suchtransactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that such transactions will besuccessful. Acquisitions may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and exposeus to additional business risks that are different than those we have traditionally experienced.We also may encounter difficulties diligencing or integrating acquisitions and successfullymanaging the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions.In the event we make acquisitions using our stock as consideration, we could dilute shareownership.     As we have announced, we intend to grow our business not only organically but also potentiallythrough acquisitions. One method of paying for acquisitions or to otherwise fund our corporateinitiatives is through the issuance of additional equity securities. If we do issue additionalequity securities; this could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and shareholders percentage ownership.Delaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover or change of control.     We are a Delaware corporation. Various anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law imposeimpediments on the ability of others to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would bebeneficial to our stockholders. In addition, certain provisions of our bylaws may impede ordiscourage a takeover. For example:  our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms;   vacancies on the board can only be filled by other directors;   there are various restrictions on the ability of a shareholder to nominate a director for election; and   our Board of Directors can authorize the issuance of preference shares.     These types of provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control ofus, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders. Accordingly, shareholders maybe limited in the ability to obtain a premium for their shares.As a holding company, we are dependent on our subsidiaries for cash distributions to fund debtpayments.     Because we are a holding company, we have no true operations or significant assets other thanthe stock we own of our subsidiaries. We depend on dividends, loans and other distributions fromthese subsidiaries for us to be able to pay our debt and other financial obligations. Contractuallimitations and legal regulations may restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make suchdistributions or loans to us or, if made, may be insufficient to cover our financial obligations,or to pay interest or principal when due on our debt.16Table of ContentsWe are dependent upon third parties to complete many of our contracts.     Much of the work performed under our contracts is actually performed by third-partysubcontractors we hire. We also rely on third-party equipment manufacturers or suppliers toprovide much of the equipment used for projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractorsor find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete aproject could be impaired. If the amount we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipmentand supplies exceeds what we have estimated, especially in a lump sum or a fixed-price typecontract, we may suffer losses on these contracts. If a supplier, manufacturer or subcontractorfails to provide supplies, equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for anyreason, we may be required to source these supplies, equipment or services on a delayed basis or ata higher price than anticipated which could impact contract profitability.We maintain a workforce based upon current and anticipated workloads. If we do not receive futurecontract awards or if these awards are delayed, significant costs may result.     Our estimates of future performance depend on, among other matters, whether and when we willreceive certain new contract awards. While our estimates are based upon our good faith judgment,these estimates can be unreliable and may frequently change based on newly available information.In the case of large-scale domestic and international projects where timing is often uncertain, itis particularly difficult to predict whether and when we will receive a contract award. Theuncertainty of contract award timing can present difficulties in matching our workforce size withour contract needs. If an expected contract award is delayed or not received, we could incur costsresulting from reductions in staff or redundancy of facilities that would have the effect ofreducing our profits.Systems and information technology interruption could adversely impact our ability to operate.     As a global company, we are heavily reliant on computer, information and communicationstechnology and related systems in order to properly operate. From time to time, we experienceoccasional system interruptions and delays. If we are unable to continually add software andhardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure and take other steps toimprove the efficiency of and protect our systems, systems operation could be interrupted ordelayed. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged orinterrupted by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of war orterrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar events ordisruptions. Any of these or other events could cause system interruption, delays and loss ofcritical data, could delay or prevent operations, and could adversely affect our operating results"
