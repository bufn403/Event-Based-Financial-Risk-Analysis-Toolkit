RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)- -------   -----------------------FUTURE GROWTH AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL CAPITAL- ---------------------------------------------------------------------WHOSE AVAILABILITY IS NOT ASSURED- ---------------------------------We expect to continue making investments in real estate development.Based on the status of several specific real estate projects, we willcontinue to invest significant amounts in real estate over the nextseveral years.  We could finance future expenditures from any of thefollowing sources:* cash flow from operations;* bank borrowings;* non-recourse, sale leaseback, or other financing;* public offerings of debt or equity;* private placement of debt or equity; or* some combination of the above.Financing for future expenditures may not be available on favorableterms or at all.COMPETITION AND MARKET CONDITIONS RELATING TO GOLF OPERATIONS- -------------------------------------------------------------COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS- ----------------------------------------Golf operations face competition from similar nearby golf operations.Any new competitive golf operations that are developed close to ourexisting golf operations also may adversely impact results ofoperations.  Golf operations are also subject to adverse marketconditions such as population trends and changing demographics, any ofwhich could adversely affect results of operations.  In addition, thegolf operations may suffer if the economy weakens, if the popularityof golf decreases, or if unusual weather conditions or other factorscause a reduction in rounds played.  Our golf operations are seasonal,primarily due to the impact of the winter tourist season and summerFlorida heat and rain.OUR COMMON STOCK IS THINLY TRADED, AND THEREFORE, THE STOCK- -----------------------------------------------------------PRICE MAY FLUCTUATE MORE THAN THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE- ---------------------------------------------------------As a result of the thin trading market for our stock, its market pricemay fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole orthe stock prices of similar companies.  Without a larger float, commonstock will be less liquid than the stock of companies with broaderpublic ownership, and as a result, the trading prices for our commonstock may be more volatile.  Among other things, trading of arelatively small volume of common stock may have a greater impact onthe trading price than would be the case if public float were larger"
