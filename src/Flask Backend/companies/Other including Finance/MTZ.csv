  You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties notcurrently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer andthe trading price of our common stock could decline.  Risks Related to Our Industry and Our CustomersIndustries  The current credit crisis and economic downturn could reduce capital expenditures in the industries weserve, which may result in a decrease in demand for our services.  The demand for our services has been, and will likelycontinue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in the U.S. economy. Given the recent financial market turmoil and tightening of credit, our customers may not have the ability to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure,or may have difficulty in obtaining financing, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in cancellations of projects or deferral of projects to a later date. Such cancellations or deferrals have resulted, and could continue to result, indecreased demand for our services and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  In addition, our customers are affected by economic downturns that decrease the need for their services or the profitability of their services. Slow-downs in real estate, fluctuations in commodity prices and decreased demand byend-customers for higher value services could affect our customers and their capital expenditure plans. Because we have been negatively impacted by previous economic downturns, we constantly monitor our customers industries and their relativehealth compared to the economy as a whole. The reduction in new housing starts, for example, could negatively impact our customers who utilize our services to construct their last mile of communications infrastructure, as well as otherindustries we serve, including electric utility transmission and grid connection, water and sewer and natural gas pipeline construction. Additionally, our customers who provide satellite and broadband communications to consumers across the countrycould be adversely impacted by an economic downturn if new subscriptions and upgrades for new and existing consumers are not ordered at the rate that we and our customers anticipate. During an economic downturn, like the current economic downturn,our customers also may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure at their current levels or may determine to outsource less work. A decrease in any of these projects, new subscriptions and upgrades orany other services we provide could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  Manyof the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatory change, and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could reduce demand for our services.  We derive, and anticipate that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the communications andutilities industries. The communications and utilities industries are subject to rapid changes in technology and governmental regulation. Changes in technology may reduce the demand for the services we provide. For example, new or developingtechnologies could displace the wireline systems used for the transmission of voice, video and data, and improvements in existing technology may allow communications providers to significantly improve their networks without physically upgradingthem. Technological advances may also result in lower costs for sources of energy, which may render existing wind energy, solar energy and natural gas projects and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Additionally, both the communications andutilities industries have been characterized by a high level of consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers. Our failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are developed in any of the industries weserve or the consolidation of one or more of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  Our industry is highly competitive, which may reduce our market share and harm our financial performance.  Our industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with other companies in most of the markets in which we operate, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firms servicingregional and national markets. We also face competition from existing or prospective customers that employ in-house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide. There are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets inwhich we operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our competitors.   13 Table of ContentsMost of our customers work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price isoften the principal factor in determining which service provider is selected, especially on smaller, less complex projects. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price alone due to their lower costs andfinancial return requirements. If we are unsuccessful in bidding on these projects, or if our ability to win such projects requires that we accept lesser margins, then our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be materially andadversely affected.  Risks Related to Our Business  We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers, and the loss of one of these customers or a reduction in their demandfor our services could impair our financial performance.  For the year ended December 31, 2009, wederived approximately 30%, 16% and 7% of our revenue from DIRECTV®, AT&T and Enbridge, respectively. For theyear ended December 31, 2008, we derived approximately 34%, 12% and 8% of our revenue from DIRECTV®,AT&T and Verizon, respectively. In addition, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 72%, 72% and 77% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Because our business is concentrated amongrelatively few major customers, and certain of our services are provided on a non-recurring, project by project basis, we could experience a reduction in our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity if we lose one or more of these customersor the amount of business we obtain from them is reduced, or if we complete the required work on our projects and cannot replace them with similar projects. In addition, all of the contracts with our largest customers may be canceled on short or nonotice.  Our profitability and liquidity could decline if certain customers reduce the amounts they pay for our services orif our customers are unable to pay for our services.  In the past, we incurred significant losses after a number ofcustomers filed for bankruptcy or experienced financial difficulties following a general economic downturn and certain industry specific factors that worsened the impact of the overall economic downturn on those customers. In 2009, 2008 and 2007total provisions for bad debts aggregated to $2.4 million, $3.5 million and $17.5 million, respectively, of which $0.3 million, $0.9 million and $14.1 million, respectively, resulted from anticipated legal settlements for customers in bankruptcy anddiscontinued operations. As of December 31, 2009, we had remaining receivables from customers undergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling $1.6 million, of which $0.6 million is included in specific reserves for bad debts, with the remainingamounts expected to be recovered through secured and unsecured claims and enforcement of liens or bonds.  Most of ourcontracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us.  A significantportion of our revenue is derived from multi-year master service agreements and other service agreements. Under our multi-year master service agreements and other service agreements, we contract to provide customers with individual project services,through work orders, within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis. Under these agreements, our customers have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. A significant decline in the projects customersassign us under these service agreements could result in a decline in our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  We have recorded unrealized losses to reduce the carrying value of certain auction rate securities we hold, and we may incur additional impairment charges with respect to auction rate securities in future periods.  The current overall credit concerns in capital markets may affect our ability to liquidate certain auction rate securities that we classifyas securities available for sale on our balance sheet. Our securities available for sale consist of auction-rate securities which represent interests in pools of student loans guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Family Education LoanProgram and structured finance securities. These structured finance securities are collateralized by investment grade credit-linked notes made up of floating rate international bank notes or credit card receivable notes that collateralize creditdefault swap agreements on corporate debt obligations. As of December 31, 2009, all of our securities available for sale, with a par value of $33.7 million and a fair value of $24.5 million, had insufficient bidders at the scheduled rolloverdates.  During 2009, all of our structured finance auction rate securities, with a par value of $16.2 million and an estimatedfair value of $8.1 million, were downgraded to non-investment grade by Standard & Poors and Fitch. If there were events of default on the underlying portfolio of the credit default swaps that exceeded the stated net default rates,which range from 8% to 10.75%, we could suffer a loss on some or all of the principal value of these corporate debt obligation auction rate securities. As of December 31, 2009, we have aggregate unrealized losses on these securities of $9.1million. Of the $9.1 million, $8.1 million relates to our structured finance auction rate securities. Due to deterioration in the credit quality of these structured finance securities in 2009, we deemed the  14 Table of Contentsdecline in value for these securities to be an other-than-temporary impairment, and accordingly, recorded a charge of $6.1 million in earnings as an other-than-temporary impairment in 2009. Ourvaluation is sensitive to market conditions and managements judgment and can change significantly based on the assumptions used. Factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to theunderlying assets supporting those securities, rates of default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value, discount rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity. At this time, we are uncertainwhether the liquidity issues associated with these investments will improve, when we will be able to exit these investments at their cost basis or whether we will incur additional temporary or other-than-temporary losses as a result of theseinvestments. As a result of this uncertainty, the $24.5 million fair value of these securities is classified as long-term assets at December 31, 2009.  In October 2009, we settled our claim against the investment advisor that sold us the auction rate securities. The investment advisor paid us a one-time payment and we retained the auction ratesecurities. In connection with the settlement, we released the investment advisor from any liability or claims of any kind related to the auction rate securities. Accordingly, if we are unable to sell our auction rate securities at par in thefuture, we will have no recourse against the investment advisor.  Most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, soour revenue is not guaranteed.  Most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice, ranging from immediate cancellationto cancellation upon 180 days notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Many of our contracts, including our service agreements, are periodically open to public bid. We may not be the successful bidder on our existing contracts thatare re-bid. We also provide a significant portion of our services on a non-recurring, project-by-project basis. We could experience a reduction in our revenue, profitability and liquidity if:      our customers cancel a significant number of contracts;      we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re-bid; or      we complete the required work under a significant number of our non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects. We may not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services provided under fixed-pricecontracts which could impair our financial performance.  A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from masterservice agreements and other service agreements that are fixed price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of our services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with our performance may begreater than we anticipated. In addition to master or other service agreements, we enter into contracts that require installation or construction of specified units within an infrastructure system. Under those agreements, we have also contractuallyagreed to a price per unit. Profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates. We are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any expected losses on these projects if estimated coststo complete the remaining units for the projects exceed the revenue to be earned on such units. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services. These costs may be affected by avariety of factors, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at the work sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor. These variations, along withother risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts, may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those originally estimated, and as a result, certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated,or losses if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates, which could reduce our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.  Our failure to properly manage projects, or project delays, may result in additional costs or claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.  Certain of our engagements involve large-scale, complex projects. The quality of our performance on such a project depends in large part uponour ability to manage our client relationship and the project itself and to timely deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affectedif we miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or fixed fees, or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones. Additionally, delays on a particular project, including permitting delays, may cause usto incur costs for standby pay, and may lead to personnel shortages on other projects scheduled to commence at a later date. In addition, some of our agreements require that we share in cost overages or pay liquidated damages if we do not meetproject deadlines; therefore, any failure to properly estimate or manage cost, or delay in the completion of projects could subject us to penalties which could further adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Further,any defects or errors, or failures to meet our customers  15 Table of Contentsexpectations could result in large damage claims against us, and because of the substantial cost of, and potentially long lead-time necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipmentused in our complex projects, particularly our wind farm and pipeline projects, damage claims may substantially exceed the amount we can charge for our associated services.  We recognize revenue for our installation/construction fixed price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, therefore,variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our profitability.  We recognize revenue on long-terminstallation/construction fixed price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record revenue as work on the contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at aspecified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to date bear to estimated total contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method therefore relies on estimates of total expected contract costs. Contractrevenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the fiscal period in which such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on managementsreasonable assumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Variation of actual results from estimates on a large project or on a number of smaller projects could be material. We immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on acontract when our estimates indicate such a loss. Such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impact our liquidity. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, weincurred approximately $1.3 million, $0.7 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of losses on percentage-of-completion contracts.  Amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits, and our backlog is subject to cancellation and unexpected adjustments and therefore is an uncertain indicator of future operating results.  Approximately 66% of our 18-month backlog at December 31, 2009 was composed of master service agreements and otherservice agreements, none of which require our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice. The balance of our backlog is our estimate of work to be completed on long-term installation/construction fixedprice agreements. These backlog amounts are based on our estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated period, or at all. In addition, contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable. Wemay experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays or cancellations resulting from weather conditions, other project deferrals or delays, scope adjustments, external market factors and economic factors beyond ourcontrol. If our backlog fails to materialize, our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity would be materially and adversely affected. Accordingly, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future earnings. Our business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns of our customers,exposing us to variable quarterly results.  Some of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towardsthe end of the year. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, also affect our ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of the United States. As a result, we experience reduced revenue in the first quarter ofeach calendar year.  Natural catastrophes such as hurricanes in the United States could also have a negative impact on theeconomy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions, which could result in a decline in results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  Warranty claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We generally warrant the work we perform for a one- to two-year period following substantial completion of a project, subject to furtherextensions of the warranty period following repairs or replacements. We have not historically accrued any reserves for potential warranty claims as they have been immaterial. The costs associated with such warranties, including any warranty-relatedlegal proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  We areself-insured against many potential liabilities.  Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobileliability, general liability, workers compensation and employee group health claims, those policies are subject to high deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. Since most claims against us do not exceed thedeductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectively self-insured for substantially all claims. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but  16 Table of Contentsnot reported losses, and reflect the present value of those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non-current liabilities. The determination of such claims and expenses and theappropriateness of the related liability is reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of aninjury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, wecould experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.  Increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirementscould significantly reduce our profitability, liquidity and availability under our credit facility.  Because of factorssuch as increases in claims, projected significant increases in medical costs and wages, lost compensation and reductions in coverage, insurance carriers may be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels of coverage without asignificant increase in insurance premiums or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations. An increase in premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity as well as reduce availabilityunder our revolving credit facility.  We may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain serviceofferings, and the need for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility.  Some ofour contracts require performance and payment bonds. We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which could preclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certaincustomers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds in the future, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds which would reduce availability under our creditfacility.  The impact of the Stimulus Act is uncertain.  The lack of available capital and the illiquidity in the debt and capital markets, coupled with the economic downturn resulted in atremendous amount of uncertainty with numerous renewable energy projects being delayed or canceled. While we believe that the Stimulus Act, which was enacted into law in February 2009, should aid the wind, electrical transmission and rural broadbandbusinesses, we did not receive any Stimulus Act related revenue in 2009 and the extent to which it will result in future revenues is uncertain. We cannot predict when programs under the Stimulus Act will be implemented or the timing and scope of anyinvestments to be made under these programs. Investments for renewable energy, electric power infrastructure rural broadband facilities under Stimulus Act programs may not occur, may be less than anticipated or may be delayed, which would negativelyimpact demand for our services.  Additionally, the tax incentives provided by the Stimulus Act have a finite duration.Currently, the election to claim the investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit is only available for qualified wind facilities placed in service from 2009 to December 31, 2012; the U.S. Treasury grant program will only beapplicable to wind projects placed in service in 2009 or 2010 (or after 2010 so long as construction begins in 2009 or 2010 and is completed before 2013); and the production tax credit is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012 and will not beavailable for energy generated from wind facilities placed in service after that date unless the credit program is extended or renewed. Whether the new investment tax credit or U.S. Treasury grant program will be effective for wind projects orrenewable projects in uncertain, as are any future efforts to extend or renew the production tax credit, the investment tax credit, and/or the U.S. Treasury grant program. Furthermore, the provisions regarding any extension or renewal may not be asfavorable as those that currently exist. In addition, we cannot assure you that any extension or renewal of the production tax credit, the investment tax credit, and/or the U.S. Treasury grant program would be enacted prior to its expiration or, ifallowed to expire, that any extension or renewal enacted thereafter would be enacted with retroactive effect. We also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing for accelerated depreciation of wind generation assets will not be modified, amendedor repealed in the future. If the investment tax credit or the U.S. Treasury grant program are not effective or if the federal production tax credit is not extended or renewed, or is extended or renewed at a lower rate, the ability of our customersto obtain financing for these wind farm developments may be impaired or eliminated, and the resulting wind farms would be less profitable, thereby potentially reducing demand for our wind power services. Our revenue and results of operations couldbe materially adversely affected if demand for our wind power services or the tax incentives were reduced.  Legislativeactions and incentives relating to electric power and renewable energy may fail to result in increased demand for our services.  While we believe the Energy Act will provide opportunities in the industries we serve, implementation of the Energy Act is still subject to considerable fiscal and regulatory uncertainty. Regulations implementing the components of theEnergy Act that may affect  17 Table of Contentsdemand for our services remain in some cases subject to review in various federal courts. In one such case, decided in February 2009, a federal court of appeals vacated FERCs interpretationof the scope of its backstop siting authority. Accordingly, the effect of these regulations, once finally implemented, is uncertain. As a result, the legislation may not result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure.Continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Energy Act may result in slower growth in demand for our services. In addition, changes to energy regulatory policy may be forthcoming due to the new administration.  Changes to renewable portfolio standards could, and decreased demand for renewable energy projects would, negatively impact our resultsof operations, cash flows and liquidity.  A significant portion of our business is currently focused on providingconstruction and/or installation services to owners and operators of wind power facilities. The development of wind facilities is highly dependent upon the federal production tax credit (discussed above) and the existence of renewable portfoliostandards and other state incentives. Renewable portfolio standards are state specific statutory provisions requiring that electric utilities generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy sources or devote a certain portion of itsoperational/development capacity to renewable energy sources. Additionally, certified renewable energy generators earn certificates for every unit of electricity they produce and can sell these along with their electricity to supply companies. Thesestandards have spurred significant growth in the wind energy industry and a corresponding increase in the demand for our wind power-related services. Currently, more the half of the states in the United States as well as the District of Columbiahave adopted renewable portfolio standards or goals. Eliminations of or changes to existing renewable portfolio standards or similar environmental policies may impact the demand for our wind and solar power-related services.  Additionally, renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup. Thelocations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are not viable unless connectivity to the grid to transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible. Furthermore, funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available,which may be further constrained as a result of turbulent credit markets. These factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated or a delay in the timing of construction of these projects and the related infrastructure, whichwould negatively affect the demand for our services.  Demand for pipeline construction services depends on oil and naturalgas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices and the cost of energy infrastructure projects.  Demand for our pipeline construction services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gascompanies. Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control.Low prices for oil and natural gas generally depress levels of exploration, development, and production activity, resulting in a corresponding decline in the demand for pipeline construction services. Factors affecting the prices of oil and naturalgas include:      the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas, especially demand for natural gas in the United States;      governmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and naturalgas reserves, as well as environmental laws and initiatives to control global warming;      global weather conditions and natural disasters;      worldwide political, military, and economic conditions; the level of oil production by non-OPEC countries and the available excess production capacitywithin OPEC;      oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas; and      the cost of producing and delivering oil and gas; potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.  Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile. Spending on exploration andproduction activities by large oil and gas companies has a significant impact on the activity levels of pipeline construction services.   18 Table of ContentsIn addition, demand for pipeline construction services may be affected by the costs ofenergy exploration and constructing energy infrastructure projects. For example, while high oil and gas prices may increase oil and gas exploration, production and transportation activity, high demand for equipment, materials and labor required forsuch projects may increase the costs of such projects and dampen demand. Furthermore, increased costs for raw materials such as steel and other commodities may make some projects uneconomical despite robust oil and gas prices, thus reducing demandfor our pipeline construction services. A decrease in demand for our pipeline construction services could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  We have agreed to keep certain liabilities related to the state Department of Transportation related projects and assets that were soldin February 2007.  Effective February 1, 2007, we sold our state Department of Transportation related projects andassets. On January 24, 2008, we entered into a settlement agreement with the buyer of our state Department of Transportation projects and assets to settle previously disclosed warranty, indemnification and other claims primarily relating towork we had performed on the state Department of Transportation projects we sold. In connection with the settlement agreement, the parties also agreed to further amend and restate the Amended Asset Purchase Agreement effective as of January 24,2008, which we refer to as the Revised Amended Agreement. In connection with the sale of our state Department of Transportation related projects and assets and the related settlement, we agreed to keep certain liabilities, mainly relatedto the cost to maintain and continue certain performance and payment bonds, certain obligations under leases between the parties and certain other litigation matters. We may also be unable to recover any losses we incur as a result of any thirdparty claims to the extent any third parties seek payment from us directly and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification obligations contained in the Revised Amended Agreement, including any losses resultingfrom creditor claims, in the event the buyer was financially unable to meet certain obligations.  Under the terms of theRevised Amended Agreement, the buyer is no longer required to issue a standby letter of credit in our favor to cover any remaining exposure related to our bonded obligations. Instead, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the buyerentered into indemnity agreements directly with certain surety bonding companies in connection with our bonded obligations. Therefore, if the buyer is unable to meet its contractual obligations, the surety bonding company can seek its remedies underthe indemnity agreement. If the surety bonding company, however, pays the amounts due under the bonds, the surety bonding company will seek reimbursement of such payment from us. Accordingly, we may incur losses in the future related to thesecontingent liabilities if the buyer does not complete the bonded contracts and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in the Revised Amended Agreement. The buyer of the Department ofTransportation related projects and assets filed for bankruptcy protection in October 2009, which increases the likelihood that we will be required to assume certain obligations associated with these projects. At December 31, 2009, we estimatedthat the remaining cost to complete these state Department of Transportation projects was $0.7 million on the related $159.7 million in performance and payment bonds. Should actual costs to complete exceed estimates, we could incur future losseswhich could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  Our reporting entities may incurgoodwill impairment charges which could harm our profitability.  When we acquire a business, we record goodwill equal tothe excess amount we pay for the business, including anticipated future liabilities and liabilities assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of that business. As a result of acquisitions, we have $579.5 million and $420.6million of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. We expect to continue to record additions to goodwill in future periods in connection with completed acquisitions,particularly as a result of future earn-out payments for acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2008, or from any future acquisitions.  We periodically review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether such carrying values exceed their fair market values. In connection with our decision to sell substantially all our Canadiannet assets, we wrote off goodwill associated with this entity in the amount of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. We may incur additional impairment charges related to goodwill in connection with any of our acquisitions in thefuture if the markets they serve or their businesses deteriorate.  We may incur restructuring or impairment charges, whichcould reduce our profitability.  From time to time we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability. We couldincur charges in the future as a result of:      eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business strategy;      reducing or eliminating services or operations that do not produce adequate revenue or margin;   19 Table of Contents   reducing costs of businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but need margin improvements; and      reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources.  For example, as a result of the sale of our state Department of Transportation operations, we recorded impairment charges totaling $2.9million for the year ended December 31, 2007. All charges related to restructuring or impairment would be reflected as operating expenses and could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity.  Our revolving credit facility, senior notes and senior convertible notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging intransactions that might benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.  At December 31, 2009, we had $365 million aggregate principal amount outstanding on our senior notes due 2017 and our senior convertible notes due 2014. We also have a revolving credit facility withno outstanding balance at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, availability was approximately $89.8 million, net of outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating $79.8 million.  The terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions withoutsatisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders. The prohibited actions include, among other things:      buying back shares in excess of specified amounts;      making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts;      incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts;      paying cash dividends;      creating certain liens against our assets;      prepaying subordinated indebtedness;      engaging in certain mergers or combinations; and      engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control (as defined in the credit facility and the indenture governing our seniornotes).  Additionally, certain provisions of our convertible notes could make it more expensive for a thirdparty to acquire us or require us to repurchase the convertible notes for cash when required by the holders, including following a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture).  Our credit facility requires us to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Should we be unable to comply with the terms andcovenants of our credit facility, we would be required to obtain further modifications of the facility or secure another source of financing to continue to operate our business. A default could also result in the acceleration of our obligationsunder the credit facility, or under the indenture relating to the senior notes and the indenture relating to our convertible notes. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding tochanging business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed. Our business is capital intensive and, to the extent we need additional financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms, whichmay materially decrease our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.  If we are unable to attract and retain qualifiedmanagers and skilled employees, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.  Our business is labor intensive, and some of our operations experience a high rate of employee turnover. In addition, given the nature of the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees aretrained in and possess specialized technical skills. At times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve, it can be difficult for us to find qualified and affordable personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient skilled laborforce necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy. Our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. We may also be forced to incur significant training expenses if we are unable tohire employees with the requisite skills. Additionally, our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and is dependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management. Labor shortages, increased labor or trainingcosts, or the loss of key personnel could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.   20 Table of ContentsCertain of our businesses have employees who are represented by a union or are subject tocollective bargaining agreements; the unionized workforce and any related obligations could adversely affect our operations.  Certain of our employees are represented by labor unions and collective bargaining agreements. Although all of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in thefuture despite the terms of these agreements. Strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue. Additionally, as current agreements expire, the laborunions may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements on terms favorable to their members, or at all, or avoid strikes, lockouts or other labor actions from time to time that may affect their members. Therefore, it cannot be assured thatnew agreements will be reached with employee labor unions as existing contracts expire or on terms that we find desirable. Any labor action against us relating to failure to reach an agreement with employee labor unions could have a material adverseeffect on our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations  Our participation in multi-employer pension plans maysubject us to liabilities that could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.  Substantially all of our union and collective bargaining agreements require us to participate with other companies in multi-employer pension plans. To the extent that those plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Actof 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated. Furthermore, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added newfunding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as endangered, seriously endangered, or critical status. For a plan in criticalstatus, benefit reductions may apply and/or we may be required to make additional contributions if a plan is determined to be underfunded, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.  Increases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins.  The price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our control, includinggeopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Most of our contracts do not allowus to adjust our pricing. Accordingly, any increase in fuel costs could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity.  Our subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or other parties, or we may be unable to maintain these relationships, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows andliquidity.  We depend on subcontractors to complete some of the work on some of our projects. There is a risk that we mayhave disputes with subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task ordersunder a subcontract. In addition, if any of our subcontractors fail to deliver on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies and/or perform the agreed-upon services, then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor may be jeopardized.In addition, the absence of qualified subcontractors with whom we have a satisfactory relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. Any of these factors may have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  We may choose, or be required, to pay oursubcontractors even if our customers do not pay, or delay paying us for the related services.  We use subcontractors toperform portions of our services and to manage work flow. In some cases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If we choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers whofail to pay, or delay paying us for the related work, we could experience a material decrease in profitability and liquidity.   21 Table of ContentsOur business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments, which could causedelays and result in additional costs.  We perform work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to,difficult and hard to reach terrain and difficult site conditions. Performing work under such conditions can result in project delays or cancellations, potentially causing us to incur additional, unanticipated costs, reductions in revenues or thepayment of liquidated damages. In addition, some of our contracts require that we assume the risk that actual site conditions vary from those expected.  Some of our projects involve challenging engineering, procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods, sometimes over several years. We may encounter difficulties inengineering, delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party, equipment and material delivery, schedule changes, delays from customer failure to timely obtain rights-of-way, weather-related delays, delays by subcontractorsin completing their portion of the project, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control, but which impact our ability to complete a project within the original delivery schedule. In some cases, delays and additional costs may besubstantial, and we may be required to cancel a project and/or compensate the customer for the delay. We may not be able to recover any of such costs. Any such delays or cancellations, defects or errors or other failures to meet customerexpectations could result in damage claims substantially in excess of the revenue associated with a project, as well as negatively impact our reputation or relationships with customers, adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.  Some of the work we perform is in underground environments. If the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if objects arepresent in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants. In such a case, we may be liable for fines anddamages.  We own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these facilities contain fuel storagetanks which may be above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.  We sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it is possible thatsuch directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurface materials. These releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law, potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines.  In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previouslyunknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material negative impact our results of operations,cash flows and liquidity.  Our failure to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, the U.S. Department of Transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.  The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or OSHA, establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance ofa workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements. Variousstandards, including standards for notices of hazards and safety in excavation and demolition work may apply to our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary courseof business in complying with OSHA and other state and local laws and regulations, and could incur penalties and fines in the future, including in extreme cases, criminal sanctions.  While we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs, our industry involvesa high degree of operational risk, and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure. Although we have taken what are believed to be appropriate precautions, we have suffered employee injuries and fatalities in the pastand may suffer additional injuries or fatalities in the future. Serious accidents of this nature may subject us to substantial penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Personal injury claims for damages, including for bodily injury orloss of life, could result in substantial costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate, or if wesuffered substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations, customers could cancel existing contracts and not award future business to us, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flowsand results of operations.   22 Table of ContentsWe have, from time to time, received notice from the U.S. Department of Transportation thatour motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges. If we were not able to successfully resolve these issues, our abilityto service our customers could be damaged, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  Our financial results are based, in part, upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.  In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management thataffect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot becalculated with a high degree of precision from data available. In some cases, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of revenue recognition for costs andestimated earnings in excess of billings, allowance for doubtful accounts, accrued self-insured claims, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, including amortization of intangibles,the fair value of securities available for sale and accounting for performance-based stock awards, income taxes (including net deferred tax assets) and other contingencies, including litigation matters. Actual results could differ materially fromthe estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  Our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken our financial condition.  Construction projects undertaken by our employees involve exposure to electrical lines, pipelines carrying potentially explosive materials, heavy equipment, mechanical failures, transportation accidents,adverse weather conditions and damage to equipment and property. These hazards can cause personal injuries and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages and could lead to suspension ofoperations and large damage claims which could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount we charge for the associated services. In addition, if serious accidents or fatalities occur, or our safety records were to deteriorate, we may berestricted from bidding on certain work and obtaining other new contracts and certain existing contracts could be terminated. Our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus. See Risk Factors
 - Ourfailure to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. Department of Transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue,profitability and liquidity. The occurrence of accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities, employee turnover, increase the costs of our projects, or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into newcontracts with customers, which could materially reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.  Our operations mayimpact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in material liabilities.  Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products, PCBs, fuel storage and air quality. Certain of ourcurrent and historical construction operations have used hazardous materials and, to the extent that such materials are not properly stored, contained or recycled, they could become hazardous waste. Additionally, some of our contracts require thatwe assume the environmental risk of site conditions and require that we indemnify our customers for any damages, including environmental damages, incurred in connection with our projects. We may be subject to claims under various environmental lawsand regulations federal and state statutes and/or common law doctrines for toxic torts and other damages, as well as for natural resource damages and the investigation and clean up of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media under laws suchas CERCLA. Such claims may arise, for example, out of current or former conditions at project sites, current or former properties owned or leased by us, and contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties. Liability maybe imposed without regard to fault and may be strict, joint and several, such that we may be held responsible for more than our share of any contamination or other damages, or even for the entire share, and may be unable to obtain reimbursement fromthe parties causing the contamination.   23 Table of ContentsMany of our customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations or changesto existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contracting services and the profitability of those services.  Many of our communications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and our energy customers are regulated by FERC, and, in addition, our utility customers are regulatedby state public utility commissions. These agencies may interpret the application of their regulations in a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additional regulations. If existing or newregulations have an adverse affect on our customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, then demand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced.  Claims, lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.  We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions may seek, amongother things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties or other losses, consequential damages, or injunctive ordeclaratory relief. In addition, pursuant to our service agreements, we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide. Claimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs. Whenappropriate, we establish reserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in light of current information, legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to casedevelopments. If our reserves are inadequate, or if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or there is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure, we could experience a reduction in our profitabilityand liquidity. An adverse determination on any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm ourreputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.  Acquisitions involve risks that could resultin a reduction of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.  We have made, and in the future may continue to makestrategic acquisitions such as our recent acquisition of Precision. However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or may be unable to obtain the consent of our lenders and therefore not be able to complete suchacquisitions. We may pay for acquisitions with our common stock or with convertible securities, which may dilute your investment in our common stock, or we may decide to pursue acquisitions that investors may not agree with. In connection with mostof our acquisitions, we have also agreed to substantial earn-out arrangements. To the extent we defer the payment of the purchase price for any acquisition through a cash earn-out arrangement, it will reduce our cash flows in subsequent periods. Inaddition, acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:      the ability to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate acquired business operations and financial reporting and accountingcontrol systems into our business;      increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with an acquisition;      the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or marketconditions, or unforeseen internal difficulties;      the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;      diversion of managements attention; and      the ability to retain or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.  In addition, acquired companies may have liabilities that we failed, or were unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligenceinvestigations. We cannot assure you that the indemnification granted to us by sellers of acquired companies will be sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties that weassume upon consummation of an acquisition. We may learn additional information about our acquired businesses that materially adversely affect us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and liabilities related to compliance with applicable laws.Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Failure tosuccessfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Borrowings or issuances of convertible securities associated withthese acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms.   24 Table of ContentsOur inability to enforce non-competition agreements with former principals and keymanagement of the businesses we acquire may adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.  Inconnection with our acquisitions, we generally require that key management and the former principals of the businesses we acquire enter into non-competition agreements in our favor. The laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability ofnon-competition agreements. Generally, state courts will examine all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to enforce a non-competition agreement; consequently, we cannot predict with certainty whether, if challenged, a court willenforce any particular non-competition agreement. If one or more former principals or members of key management of the businesses we acquire leave and the courts refuse to enforce the non-compete agreement entered into by such person or persons, wemight be subject to increased competition, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.  Risks Related to Our Company and Our Common Stock  We have asignificant amount of debt. Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations.  We have a significant amount of debt and substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $438million of outstanding debt.  This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:     making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations;      an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of defaultcould result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;      reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate requirements, andlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;      subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowingsunder our credit facility;      limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which weoperate and the general economy; and      placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.  Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our abilityto meet our payment obligations.  Our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends onour ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure youthat our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidityneeds. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, and some of theseactivities may on terms that are unfavorable or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives,we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.  The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be,highly volatile.  During the three years ended December 31, 2009, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $16.25per share to a low of $5.55 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:      announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors;   25 Table of Contents   future sales of our common stock or other securities, including any shares issued in connection with earn-out obligations for any past or futureacquisition;      announcements by us or one of our competitors of new or terminated customers or new, amended or terminated contracts;      market conditions for providers of services to communications companies, utilities and government;      conversions or anticipated conversions of our senior convertible notes, or any sales in the public market of any of our common stock issuable upon suchconversion;      changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and      announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.  In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent years, which have sometimes been unrelatedor disproportionate to operating performance. The market price for our common stock has been volatile, and such volatility could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease and could cause you to lose some or all of your investment in ourcommon stock.  There may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price ofour common stock. In connection with certain completed acquisitions, we have issued shares of our common stock or securities that are convertible into shares of our common stock, and in addition, we have the option to issue shares of our commonstock instead of cash as consideration for future earn-out obligations. We may agree to issue additional securities in connection with other future acquisitions; which, if issued, would dilute your share ownership and could lead to volatility in ourcommon stock price.  We grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies orotherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. In connection with certain completed acquisitions, we have the option to issue shares of our common stock instead of cash for certain earn-outobligations, provided we first register those shares for resale, including one such obligation for which our earn-out obligation is unlimited. Such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existingshareholders individual ownership percentages and could lead to volatility in our common stock price. Our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation provide that we may issue up to a total 145,000,000 shares of common stock, of which75,954,004 shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2009.  We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock,including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock. We issued $115 million of 4% senior convertible notes in June 2009, the proceeds of which were partially used to redeem at parthe $55 million 8% convertible notes issued in connection with the Wanzek acquisition in December 2008. In connection with the acquisition of Precision, we issued $100 million of 4.25% senior convertible notes in November 2009. The issuance ofadditional shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes, in connection with future acquisitions or other issuances of our common stock or convertible securities, including outstanding options and warrants, or otherwise willdilute the ownership interest of our common shareholders. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our abilityto raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock. A small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporate decisions.  Jorge Mas, our Chairman, Jose Mas, our Chief Executive Officer and other members of the Mas family who are employed by MasTec, beneficiallyowned approximately 28.4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2009. Accordingly, they are in a position to influence:      the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;     the nomination of individuals to our Board of Directors; and      a change in our control.  These factors may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that you might consider in your best interest or that might result in you receiving a premium for your common stock.   26 Table of ContentsOur articles of incorporation and certain provisions of Florida law contain anti-takeoverprovisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control.  Certain provisions of our articles ofincorporation and by-laws and the Florida Business Corporation Act, or the FBCA, could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management, even if doing so might be beneficial to ourshareholders by providing them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then market price of our common stock. For example, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of ourshareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our Board of Directors. Consequently, it will take at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our Board ofDirectors, which may discourage hostile takeover bids. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock could also dilute thevoting power of holders of our common stock, including the granting of voting control to others, which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control.   "
11,MTZ,MASTEC INC,2009-03-02,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below,    together with all of the other information in this Annual Report    on    Form 10-K.    The risks described below are not the only risks facing us.    Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or    that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and    adversely affect our business operations. If any of these risks    actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results    of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common    stock could decline. Risks    Related to Our Industry and Our Customers    Industries The    current credit crisis and economic downturn could reduce capital    expenditures in the industries we serve, which may result in a    decrease in demand for our services.     The demand for our services has been, and will likely continue    to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to general downturns in    the U.S. economy. Given the recent financial market turmoil    and tightening of credit, our customers may have difficulty in    obtaining financing, which may result in cancellations of    projects or deferral of projects to a later date. Such    cancellations or deferrals could result in decreased demand for    our services and could materially adversely affect our results    of operations, cash flows and liquidity.     In addition, our customers are affected by economic downturns    that decrease the need for their services or the profitability    of their services. Slow-downs in real estate, fluctuations in    commodity prices and decreased demand by end-customers for    higher value services could affect our customers and their    capital expenditure plans. Because we have been negatively    impacted by previous economic downturns, we constantly monitor    our customers industries and their relative health    compared to the economy as a whole. The recent reduction in new    housing starts, for example, could negatively impact our    customers who utilize our services to construct their last    mile of communications infrastructure, as well as other    industries we serve, including electric utility transmission and    grid connection, water and sewer and natural gas pipeline    construction. Additionally, our customers who provide satellite    and broadband communications to consumers across the country    could be adversely impacted by an economic downturn if new    subscriptions and upgrades for new and existing consumers are    not ordered at the rate    13Table of Contents    that we and our customers anticipate. During an economic    downturn, our customers also may not have the ability or desire    to continue to fund capital expenditures for infrastructure at    their current levels or may determine to outsource less work. A    decrease in any of these projects, new subscriptions and    upgrades or any other services we provide could materially    adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and    liquidity. Many    of the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and    rapid technological and regulatory change, and our inability or    failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could    reduce demand for our services.     We derive, and anticipate that we will continue to derive, a    substantial portion of our revenue from customers in the    communications and utilities industries. The communications and    utilities industries are subject to rapid changes in technology    and governmental regulation. Changes in technology may reduce    the demand for the services we provide. For example, new or    developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used    for the transmission of voice, video and data, and improvements    in existing technology may allow communications providers to    significantly improve their networks without physically    upgrading them. Technological advances may also result in lower    costs for sources of energy, which may render existing wind    energy projects and technologies uncompetitive or obsolete.    Additionally, both the communications and utilities industries    have been characterized by a high level of consolidation that    may result in the loss of one or more of our customers. Our    failure to rapidly adopt and master new technologies as they are    developed in any of the industries we serve or the consolidation    of one or more of our significant customers could have a    material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows    and liquidity. Our    industry is highly competitive, which may reduce our market    share and harm our financial performance.     Our industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with other    companies in most of the markets in which we operate, ranging    from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger    firms servicing regional and national markets. We also face    competition from existing or prospective customers that employ    in-house personnel to perform some of the same types of services    we provide. There are relatively few barriers to entry into the    markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization    that has adequate financial resources and access to technical    expertise and skilled personnel may become one of our    competitors.     Most of our customers work is awarded through a bid    process. Consequently, price is often the principal factor in    determining which service provider is selected, especially on    smaller, less complex projects. Smaller competitors are    sometimes able to win bids for these projects based on price    alone due to their lower costs and financial return    requirements. If we are unsuccessful in bidding on these    projects, or if our ability to win such projects requires that    we accept lesser margins, then our results of operations, cash    flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Risks    Related to Our Business We    derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few    customers, and the loss of one of these customers or a reduction    in their demand for our services could impair our financial    performance.     For the year ended December 31, 2008, we derived    approximately 34.0%, 11.9% and 7.9% of our revenue from    DIRECTV®,    AT&T and Verizon, and respectively. For the year ended    December 31, 2007, we derived approximately 44.1%, 6.8% and    9.1% of our revenue from    DIRECTV®,    AT&T and Verizon, respectively. In addition, our ten    largest customers accounted for approximately 71.2%, 76.7%, and    76.4% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2008,    2007 and 2006, respectively. Because our business is    concentrated among relatively few major customers, our revenue    could significantly decline if we lose one or more of these    customers or if the amount of business we obtain from them is    reduced, which could result in reduced profitability and    liquidity. Our    profitability and liquidity could decline if certain customers    reduce the amounts they pay for our services or if our customers    are unable to pay for our services.     In the past, we incurred significant losses after a number of    customers filed for bankruptcy or experienced financial    difficulties following a general economic downturn and certain    industry specific factors that worsened the impact of the    overall economic downturn on those customers. In 2008, 2007 and    2006 total provisions for bad debts    14Table of Contents    aggregated to $3.5 million, $17.5 million and    $10.0 million, respectively, of which $0.9 million,    $14.1 million and $7.9 million, respectively, resulted    from anticipated legal settlements and discontinued operations.    As of December 31, 2008, we had remaining receivables from    customers undergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling    $1.6 million, of which $0.3 million is included in    specific reserves for bad debts, with the remaining amounts    expected to be recovered through secured and unsecured claims    and enforcement of liens or bonds. Most    of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any    infrastructure projects or other work with us.     A significant portion of our revenue is derived from multi-year    master service agreements and other service agreements. Under    our multi-year master service agreements and other service    agreements, we contract to provide customers with individual    project services, through work orders, within defined geographic    areas on a fixed fee basis. Under these agreements, our    customers have no obligation to undertake any infrastructure    projects or other work with us. A significant decline in the    projects customers assign us under these service agreements    could result in a decline in our results of operations, cash    flows and liquidity. We    recorded unrealized losses in 2007 and 2008 to reduce the    carrying value of certain auction rate securities we hold, and    we may incur additional impairment charges with respect to    auction rate securities in future periods.     The current overall credit concerns in capital markets may    affect our ability to liquidate certain securities that we    classify as securities available for sale on our balance sheet.    As of December 31, 2008, all of our securities available    for sale, or $33.7 million in par value of auction rate    securities, had insufficient bidders at the scheduled rollover    dates. We have recorded an aggregate unrealized loss on these    securities of $13.1 million as of December 31, 2008.    Our valuation is sensitive to market conditions and    managements judgment and can change significantly based on    the assumptions used. Factors that may impact our valuation    include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as    to the underlying assets supporting those securities, rates of    default of the underlying assets, underlying collateral value,    discount rates, counterparty risk and ongoing strength and    quality of market credit and liquidity. At this time, we are    uncertain whether the liquidity issues associated with these    investments will improve, when we will be able to exit these    investments at their par value or whether we will incur any    additional temporary or other-than-temporary losses as a result    of these investments. As a result of this uncertainty, we have    classified the $20.6 million fair value of these securities    to long-term assets at December 31, 2008. Most    of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, so our revenue    is not guaranteed.     Most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice, ranging    from immediate cancellation to cancellation upon 180 days    notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Many    of our contracts, including our service agreements, are    periodically open to public bid. We may not be the successful    bidder on our existing contracts that are re-bid. We also    provide a significant portion of our services on a    non-recurring,    project-by-project    basis. We could experience a reduction in our revenue,    profitability and liquidity if:           our customers cancel a significant number of contracts;           we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts    upon re-bid; or           we complete the required work under a significant number of our    non-recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar    projects. We may    not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services    provided under fixed-price contracts which could impair our    financial performance.     A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from master    service agreements and other service agreements that are fixed    price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of our    services on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk    that the costs associated with our performance may be greater    than we anticipated. In addition to master or other service    agreements we enter into contracts that require installation or    construction of specified units within an infrastructure system.    Under those agreements, we have also contractually agreed to a    price per unit. Profitability will be reduced if the actual    costs to complete each unit exceed original estimates. We are    also required    15Table of Contents    to immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated costs    on these projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining    units for the projects exceed the revenue to be earned on such    units.     Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to    accurately estimate the costs associated with our services.    These costs may be affected by a variety of factors, such as    lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at the work    sites differing materially from what was anticipated at the time    we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor.    Certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than    anticipated or losses if actual costs for our contracts exceed    our estimates, which could reduce our profitability, cash flows    and liquidity. Our    failure to properly manage projects may result in additional    costs or claims, which could have a material adverse effect on    our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.     Certain of our engagements involve large-scale, complex    projects. The quality of our performance on such a project    depends in large part upon our ability to manage our client    relationship and the project itself and to timely deploy    appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our    own personnel. Our results of operations, cash flows and    liquidity could be adversely affected if we miscalculate the    resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or    fixed fees, or the resources or time needed to meet contractual    milestones. In addition, some of our agreements require that we    pay liquidated damages if we do not meet project deadlines;    therefore, any delay in the completion of projects could subject    us to penalties which could further adversely affect our results    of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Further, any defects or    errors, or failures to meet our customers expectations    could result in large damage claims against us, and, because of    the substantial cost of, and potentially long lead-time    necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipment used    in our complex projects, particularly our wind farm projects,    damage claims may substantially exceed the amount we can charge    for our associated services. We    recognize revenue for our installation/construction fixed price    contracts using the percentage-of-completion method, therefore,    variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduce our    profitability.     We recognize revenue on long-term installation/construction    fixed price contracts using the percentage-of-completion method.    Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record revenue as    work on the contract progresses. The cumulative amount of    revenue recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is    that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs    to date bear to estimated total contract costs. The    percentage-of-completion method therefore relies on estimates of    total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost    estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work    progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue in the    fiscal period in which such estimates are revised. Estimates are    based on managements reasonable assumptions and    experience, but are only estimates. Variation of actual results    from estimates on a large project or on a number of smaller    projects could be material. We immediately recognize the full    amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates    indicate such a loss. Such adjustments and accrued losses could    result in reduced profitability which could negatively impact    our liquidity. For example, for the years ended    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, we incurred approximately    $0.7 million, $0.3 million and $6.8 million,    respectively, of losses on percentage-of-completion contracts.    For the year ended December 31, 2006, $6.5 million was    included in loss from discontinued operations. Amounts    included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or    translate into profits.     Approximately 83% of our    18-month    backlog at December 31, 2008 was composed of master service    agreements and other service agreements, none of which require    our customers to purchase a minimum amount of services and are    cancelable on short notice. The balance of our backlog is our    estimate of work to be completed on long-term    installation/construction fixed price agreements. These backlog    amounts are based on our estimates and therefore may not result    in actual receipt of revenue in the originally anticipated    period, or at all. In addition, contracts included in our    backlog may not be profitable. We may experience variances in    the realization of our backlog because of project delays or    cancellations resulting from weather conditions, external market    factors and economic factors beyond our control. If our backlog    fails to materialize, our results of operations, cash flows and    liquidity would be materially and adversely affected.    16Table of ContentsOur    business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather    conditions and the spending patterns of our customers, exposing    us to variable quarterly results.     The budgetary years of many of our specialty infrastructure    services customers end December 31. As a result, some of    our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests    towards the end of the year. Adverse weather conditions,    particularly during the winter season, also affect our ability    to perform outdoor services in certain regions of the United    States. As a result, we experience reduced revenue in the first    quarter of each calendar year.     Natural catastrophes such as hurricanes in the United States    could also have a negative impact on the economy overall and on    our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions or    utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions, which    could result in a decline in results of operations, cash flows    and liquidity. Warranty    claims resulting from our services could have a material adverse    effect on our business.     We generally warrant the work we perform for a one- to two-year    period following substantial completion of a project, subject to    further extensions of the warranty period following repairs or    replacements. We have not historically accrued any reserves for    potential warranty claims as they have been immaterial. The    costs associated with such warranties, including any    warranty-related legal proceedings, could have a material    adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and    liquidity. We are    self-insured against many potential liabilities.     Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to    automobile liability, general liability, workers    compensation and employee group health claims, those policies    are subject to high deductibles, and we are self-insured up to    the amount of the deductible. Since most claims against us do    not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are    effectively self-insured for substantially all claims. We    actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and    associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses,    and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other    current and non-current liabilities. The determination of such    claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is    reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities    are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant    factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the    severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in    proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not    reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If our    insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of    insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in    profitability and liquidity. Increases    in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements could    significantly reduce our profitability, liquidity and    availability under our credit facility.     Because of factors such as increases in claims, projected    significant increases in medical costs and wages, lost    compensation and reductions in coverage, insurance carriers may    be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels    of coverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums    or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations.    An increase in premiums or collateral requirements could    significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity as well as    reduce availability under our revolving credit facility. We may    be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support    certain service offerings, and the need for performance and    surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit    facility.     Some of our contracts require performance and payment bonds. We    may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding    capacity in the future, which could preclude us from being able    to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with    certain customers. In addition, even if we are able to    successfully renew or obtain performance or payment bonds in the    future, we may be required to post letters of credit in    connection with the bonds which would reduce availability under    our credit facility. The    impact of the Stimulus Act is uncertain.     The credit crisis and economic downturn resulted in a tremendous    amount of uncertainty with certain projects being delayed or    cancelled. While we believe that the Stimulus Act, which was    enacted into law in February 2009, should aid the wind,    electrical transmission and rural broadband businesses, the    extent to which it will is uncertain.    17Table of Contents    The Stimulus Act provides for federal tax incentives applicable    to the wind energy industry including an investment tax credit,    a U.S. Treasury grant program, the production tax credit    and accelerated tax depreciation for certain wind assets. The    investment tax credit provides that taxpayers can elect to claim    an investment tax credit equal to 30% of the cost of certain    qualifying assets in lieu of the production tax credit. The    grant program allows taxpayers that elect to claim the 30%    investment tax credit in lieu of the production tax credit to    receive grants from the U.S. Treasury equal to the amount    of the investment tax credit (which grants shall be in lieu of    such credit). The production tax credit currently provides the    owner of a U.S. wind facility (consisting of the pad,    tower, and turbine) with a ten-year credit against its federal    income tax obligations based on the amount of electricity    produced at such facility by the owner and sold to unrelated    persons during that period. The accelerated depreciation for    wind generation assets provides for a five-year depreciable life    for these assets, rather than the 15- to    20-year    depreciable lives of many non-renewable energy assets. The    Stimulus Act also extends the 50% bonus depreciation deduction    for property placed in service in 2009.     The Stimulus Act also contains several provisions aimed at    improving the U.S.s electrical transmission system in part    to facilitate the transfer of renewable energy from rural areas    to high demand areas, including $6 billion in funds for    renewable energy and transmission loan guarantees. The Stimulus    Act also provides for $7.2 billion in funds for the    development of broadband facilities throughout the United    States. There are, however, many uncertainties surrounding how    these provisions of the Stimulus Act will be implemented and    their effectiveness and we also cannot guarantee you that we    will be able to secure additional work as a result of the    Stimulus Act.     The tax incentives provided by the Stimulus Act, however, have a    finite term. Currently, the election to claim the investment tax    credit in lieu of the production tax credit is only available    for qualified wind facilities placed in service from 2009 to    2012, the U.S. Treasury grant program will only be    applicable to wind projects placed in service in 2009 or 2010    (or after 2010 so long as construction begins in 2009 or 2010    and is completed before 2013), and the production tax credit is    scheduled to expire on December 31, 2012 and will not be    available for energy generated from wind facilities placed in    service after that date unless extended or renewed. We cannot    assure you that the new investment tax credit or    U.S. Treasury grant program will be effective or that any    future efforts to extend or renew the production tax credit, the    investment tax credit, or the U.S. Treasury grant program    will be successful or that any extension or renewal will be on    terms that are as favorable as those that currently exist. In    addition, we cannot assure you that any extension or renewal of    the production tax credit, the investment tax credit, or the    U.S. Treasury grant program would be enacted prior to its    expiration or, if allowed to expire, that any extension or    renewal enacted thereafter would be enacted with retroactive    effect. We also cannot assure you that the tax laws providing    for accelerated depreciation of wind generation assets will not    be modified, amended or repealed in the future. The ability of    our customers to obtain financing for these wind farm    developments would be impaired or eliminated and the resulting    wind farms would be less profitable thereby potentially reducing    demand for our wind power services if the investment tax credit    or the Department of Energy grant program are not effective or    if the federal production tax credit is not extended or renewed,    or is extended or renewed at a lower rate. This ability may be    further impaired or eliminated if the investment tax credit or    the U.S. Treasury grant program in not extended or renewed,    or is extended or renewed at a lower rate. Our revenue and    results of operations could be materially adversely affected if    demand for our wind power services were reduced. Changes    to renewable portfolio standards could negatively impact our    results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.     A significant portion of our business is currently focused on    providing services to owners and operators of wind power    facilities. The development of wind facilities is highly    dependent upon the federal production tax credit (discussed    above) and the existence of renewable portfolio standards and    other state incentives. Renewable portfolio standards are state    specific statutory provisions specifying that electric utilities    generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable energy    sources or devote a certain portion of its plant capacity to    renewable energy sources. Additionally, certified renewable    energy generators earn certificates for every unit of    electricity they produce and can sell these along with their    electricity to supply companies. These standards have spurred    significant growth in the wind energy industry and a    corresponding increase in the demand for our wind power-related    services. Currently, 26 states in the United States as well    as the District of Columbia have adopted renewable portfolio    standards or goals. Eliminations of or changes to existing    renewable portfolio standards may impact the demand for our wind    power-related services.    18Table of ContentsWe    have agreed to keep certain liabilities related to the state    Department of Transportation related projects and assets that    were sold in February 2007.     Effective February 1, 2007, we sold our state Department of    Transportation related projects and assets. On January 24,    2008, we entered into a settlement agreement with the buyer of    our state Department of Transportation projects and assets to    settle previously disclosed warranty, indemnification and other    claims primarily relating to work we had performed on the state    Department of Transportation projects we sold. In connection    with the settlement agreement, the parties also agreed to    further amend and restate the Amended Asset Purchase Agreement    effective as of January 24, 2008, which we refer to as the    Revised Amended Agreement. In connection with the    sale of our state Department of Transportation related projects    and assets and the related settlement, we agreed to keep certain    liabilities, mainly related to the cost to maintain and continue    certain performance and payment bonds, certain obligations under    leases between the parties and certain other litigation matters.    We may also be unable to recover any losses we incur as a result    of any third party claims to the extent any third parties seek    payment from us directly and we are unable to recover such    losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification    obligations contained in the Revised Amended Agreement;    including, in the event the buyer were financially unable to    meet certain obligations, any losses resulting from creditor    claims.     Under the terms of the Revised Amended Agreement, the buyer is    no longer required to issue a standby letter of credit in our    favor in February 2008 to cover any remaining exposure related    to our bonded obligations. Instead, pursuant to the terms of the    settlement agreement, the buyer entered into indemnity    agreements directly with certain surety bonding companies in    connection with our bonded obligations. Therefore, if the buyer    is unable to meet its contractual obligations, the surety    bonding company can seek its remedies under the indemnity    agreement. If the surety bonding company, however, pays the    amounts due under the bonds, the surety bonding company will    seek reimbursement of such payment from us. Accordingly, we may    incur losses in the future related to these contingent    liabilities if the buyer does not complete the bonded contracts    and we are unable to recover such losses from the buyer pursuant    to the indemnification provisions contained in the Revised    Amended Agreement. At December 31, 2008, we estimated that    the remaining cost to complete these state Department of    Transportation projects was $2.6 million on the related    $159.7 million in performance and payment bonds. We may    incur goodwill impairment charges in our reporting entities    which could harm our profitability.     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards,    No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible    Assets, or SFAS No. 142, we periodically    review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether    such carrying values exceed the fair market value. In connection    with our decision to sell substantially all our Canadian net    assets, we wrote off goodwill associated with this entity in the    amount of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31,    2007. When we acquire a business, we record goodwill equal to    the excess amount we pay for the business, including liabilities    assumed, over the fair value of the tangible and intangible    assets of the business we acquire. As a result of the    acquisitions we completed during the years ended    December 31, 2007 and 2008, we have recorded    $52.2 million and $221.5 million, respectively, of    goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets in connection    with acquisitions and payments of earn-outs made during those    periods. We expect to continue to record additions to goodwill    in future periods in connection with these acquisitions,    particularly as a result of future earn-out payments, and future    acquisitions. We may incur additional impairment charges related    to goodwill in connection with any of our acquisitions in the    future if the markets they serve or their business deteriorate. We may    incur restructuring or impairment charges which could reduce our    profitability.     From time to time we review our operations in an effort to    improve profitability. We could incur charges in the future as a    result of:           eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our    business strategy;           reducing or eliminating services that do not produce adequate    revenue or margin;           reducing costs of businesses that provide adequate profit    contributions but need margin improvements; and           reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our    existing human and physical resources.    19Table of Contents     For example, as a result of the sale of our state Department of    Transportation operations, we recorded impairment charges    totaling $44.5 million and $2.9 million for the years    ended December 31, 2006 and 2007, respectively. All charges    related to restructuring or impairment would be reflected as    operating expenses and could materially reduce our profitability    and liquidity. Our    revolving credit facility and senior notes impose restrictions    on us which may prevent us from engaging in transactions that    might benefit us, including responding to changing business and    economic conditions or securing additional financing, if    needed.     At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding    $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our    7.625% senior notes due February 2017. We also have a    revolving credit facility under which we had $42.5 million    outstanding cash draws at December 31, 2008. We amended and    restated our revolving credit facility effective July 29,    2008 and expanded the maximum available borrowing from    $150.0 million to $210.0 million, subject to certain    restrictions. At December 31, 2008, the availability under    the credit facility was approximately $82.2 million net of    outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating    $82.4 million. The terms of our indebtedness contain    customary events of default and covenants that prohibit us from    taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial    tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders. The prohibited    actions include, among other things:           buying back shares in excess of specified amounts;           making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified    amounts;           incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts;           paying cash dividends;           creating certain liens against our assets;           prepaying our other indebtedness, excluding the senior notes;           engaging in certain mergers or combinations; and           engaging in transactions that would result in a change of    control (as defined in the credit facility and indenture).     Our credit facility requires us to comply with a minimum fixed    charge coverage ratio. Should we be unable to comply with the    terms and covenants of our credit facility, we would be required    to obtain further modifications of the facility or secure    another source of financing to continue to operate our business.    A default could result in the acceleration of either our    obligations under the credit facility or under the indenture    relating to the senior notes, or both. In addition, these    covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that    benefit us, including responding to changing business and    economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.    Our business is capital intensive and, to the extent we need    additional financing, we may not be able to obtain such    financing at all or on favorable terms, which may materially    decrease our profitability, cash flows and liquidity. If we    are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled    employees, we will be unable to operate efficiently which could    reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.     Our business is labor intensive, and some of our operations    experience a high rate of employee turnover. In addition, given    the nature of the highly specialized work we perform, many of    our employees are trained in and possess specialized technical    skills. At times of low unemployment rates in the areas we    serve, it can be difficult for us to find qualified and    affordable personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain a    sufficient skilled labor force necessary to support our    operating requirements and growth strategy. Our labor expenses    may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled    personnel. We may also be forced to incur significant training    expenses if we are unable to hire employees with the requisite    skills. Additionally, our business is managed by a number of key    executive and operational officers and is dependent upon    retaining and recruiting qualified management. Labor shortages,    increased labor or training costs or the loss of key personnel    could materially adversely affect our results of operations,    cash flows and liquidity.    20Table of ContentsIncreases    in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating    margins.     The price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is    unpredictable and fluctuates based on events outside our    control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand    for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of the Petroleum    Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war and    unrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns    and environmental concerns. Most of our contracts do not allow    us to adjust our pricing. Accordingly, any increase in fuel    costs could materially reduce our profitability and liquidity. Our    subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us or    other parties, or we may be unable to maintain these    relationships, either of which may have a material adverse    affect our results of operations, cash flows and    liquidity.     We depend on subcontractors to complete some of the work on some    of our projects. There is a risk that we may have disputes with    subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and    timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer    concerns about the subcontractor or our failure to extend    existing task orders or issue new task orders under a    subcontract. In addition, if any of our subcontractors fail to    deliver on a timely basis the    agreed-upon    supplies    and/or    perform the    agreed-upon    services, then our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime    contractor may be jeopardized. In addition, the absence of    qualified subcontractors with whom we have a satisfactory    relationship could adversely affect the quality of our service    and our ability to perform under some of our contracts. Any of    these factors may have a material adverse effect on our results    of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We may    choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our    customers do not pay, or delay paying, us for the related    services.     We use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to    manage work flow. In some cases, we pay our subcontractors    before our customers pay us for the related services. If we    choose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work    performed for customers who fail to pay, or delay paying us for    the related work, we could experience a material decrease in    profitability and liquidity. Our    failure to comply with environmental laws could result in    significant liabilities.     Some of the work we perform is in underground environments. If    the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate, or if    objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the    field location maps, our underground work could strike objects    in the soil containing pollutants and result in a rupture and    discharge of pollutants. In such a case, we may be liable for    fines and damages.     We own and lease several facilities at which we store our    equipment. Some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks    which may be above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak,    we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as    potential fines.     We sometimes perform directional drilling operations below    certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies. Due    to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it    is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface    fracture releasing subsurface materials. These releases may    contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law,    potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines.     In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, stricter    enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of    previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of    new clean-up    requirements could require us to incur significant costs or    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could    have a material negative impact our results of operations, cash    flows and liquidity. Our    failure to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational    Safety and Health Administration, the U.S. Department of    Transportation and other state and local agencies that oversee    transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue,    profitability and liquidity.     The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or    OSHA, establishes certain employer responsibilities, including    maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to    cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards    promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration    and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural    requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices    of    21Table of Contents    hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work, may apply to    our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur,    capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the    ordinary course of our business in complying with OSHA and other    state and local laws and regulations and could incur penalties    and fines in the future, including in extreme cases, criminal    sanctions.     We have, from time to time, received notice from the    U.S. Department of Transportation that our motor carrier    operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our    safety performance could result in suspension or revocation of    vehicle registration privileges. If we cannot successfully    resolve these issues, our ability to service our customers could    be damaged which could lead to a material reduction of our    results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our    financial results are based, in part, upon estimates and    assumptions that may differ from actual results.     In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United    States, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by    management that affect the amounts reported in the financial    statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because    certain information that is used in the preparation of our    financial statements is either dependent on future events or    cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data    available. In some cases, these estimates are particularly    uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates    are primarily used in our assessment of the revenue recognition    for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,    allowance for doubtful accounts, accrued self-insured claims,    valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, asset lives used in    computing depreciation and amortization, including amortization    of intangibles, the fair value of securities available for sale    and accounting for performance-based stock awards, income taxes    (including net deferred tax assets) and other contingencies and    litigation. Actual results could differ materially from the    estimates and assumptions that we use, which could have a    material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows    and liquidity. Our    business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial    liabilities and weaken our financial condition.     Construction projects undertaken by our employees involve    exposure to electrical lines, pipelines carrying potentially    explosive materials, heavy equipment, mechanical failures,    transportation accidents, adverse weather conditions and damage    to equipment and property. These hazards can cause personal    injuries and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of    property and equipment and other consequential damages and could    lead to suspension of operations and large damage claims (which    could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount we charge    for the associated services). In addition, if serious accidents    or fatalities occur or our safety record were to deteriorate, we    may be restricted from bidding on certain work and obtaining    other new contracts, and certain existing contracts could be    terminated. In addition, our safety processes and procedures are    monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus. See Risk    Factors  Our failure to comply with the regulations    of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration,    the U.S. Department of Transportation and other state and    local agencies that oversee transportation and safety compliance    could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity. The    occurrence of accidents in our business could result in    significant liabilities, employee turnover, increase the costs    of our projects or harm our ability to perform under our    contracts or enter into new contracts with customers, which    could materially reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity. Many    of our customers are highly regulated and the addition of new    regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely    impact their demand for our specialty contracting services and    the profitability of those services.     Many of our communications customers are regulated by the    Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and our energy    customers are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory    Commission, or FERC, and, in addition, our utility customers are    regulated by state public utility commissions. These agencies    may interpret the application of their regulations in a manner    that is different than the way such regulations are currently    interpreted and may impose additional regulations. If existing    or new regulations have an adverse affect on our customers and    adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide,    then demand for our specialty contracting services may be    reduced.    22Table of ContentsClaims,    lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability, cash    flows and liquidity.     We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings which    arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions may    seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal    injury, workers compensation, employment discrimination,    breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil    penalties or other losses, consequential damages or injunctive    or declaratory relief. In addition, pursuant to our service    agreements, we generally indemnify our customers for claims    related to the services we provide thereunder. Claimants may    seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve    significant costs. When appropriate, we establish reserves    against these items that we believe to be adequate in the light    of current information, legal advice and professional indemnity    insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from time to    time according to case developments. If our reserves are    inadequate, or if in the future our insurance coverage proves to    be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in    liabilities for which we self-insure, we could experience a    reduction in our profitability and liquidity. An adverse    determination on any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding could    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial    condition or results of operations. In addition, claims,    lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert    management resources away from operating our business. Acquisitions    involve risks that could result in a reduction of our operating    results, cash flows and liquidity.     We have made, and in the future plan to make, strategic    acquisitions such as our recent acquisition of Wanzek    Construction, Inc., our largest strategic acquisition to date.    However, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition    opportunities or may be unable to obtain the consent of our    lenders and therefore not be able to complete such acquisitions.    We may pay for acquisitions with our common stock or convertible    securities which may dilute your investment in our common stock    or decide to pursue acquisitions that investors may not agree    with. In connection with most of our acquisitions, we have also    agreed to substantial earn-out arrangements. To the extent we    defer the payment of the purchase price for any acquisition    through a cash earn-out arrangement, it will reduce our cash    flows in subsequent periods. In addition, acquisitions may    expose us to operational challenges and risks, including:           the ability to profitably manage additional businesses or    successfully integrate the acquired business operations and    financial reporting and accounting control systems into our    business;           increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations    associated with an acquisition;           the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if    anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by    general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal    difficulties;           the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital    needs;           diversion of managements attention; and           the ability to hire qualified personnel required for expanded    operations.     A failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and    risks associated with or resulting from acquisitions could    result in a reduction of our results of operations, cash flows    and liquidity. Borrowings or issuances of convertible securities    associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher    levels of indebtedness which could impact our ability to service    our debt within the scheduled repayment terms. Our    inability to enforce non-competition agreements with former    principals and key management of the businesses we acquire may    adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and    liquidity.     In connection with our acquisitions, we generally require that    key management and the former principals of the businesses we    acquire enter into non-competition agreements in our favor. The    laws of each state differ concerning the enforceability of    non-competition agreements. Generally, state courts will examine    all of the facts and circumstances at the time a party seeks to    enforce a non-competition agreement; consequently, we cannot    predict with certainty whether, if challenged, a court will    enforce any particular non-competition agreement. If one or more    former principals or members of key management of the businesses    we acquire leave us and the courts refuse to enforce the    non-compete agreement entered into by such person or persons, we    might be subject to increased competition, which could    materially and adversely affect our operating results, cash    flows and liquidity.    23Table of ContentsRisks    Related to Our Company and Our Common Stock The    market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to    be, highly volatile.     During 2006, 2007 and 2008, our common stock fluctuated from a    high of $16.25 per share to a low of $5.55 per share. We may    continue to experience significant volatility in the market    price of our common stock. Numerous factors could have a    significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:           announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the    operating results of one of our competitors;           future sales of our common stock or other securities (including    any shares issued in connection with earn-out obligations for    any past or future acquisition);           announcements of new contracts or customers by us or one of our    competitors;           market conditions for providers of services to communications    companies, utilities and government;           changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities    analysts; and           announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.     In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price    and volume fluctuations in recent years that have sometimes been    unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of    companies. The market price for our common stock has been    volatile and such volatility could cause the market price of our    common stock to decrease and cause you to lose some or all of    your investment in our common stock. In    connection with certain completed acquisitions, we have issued    shares of our common stock or securities that are convertible    into shares of our common stock or have the option to issue    shares of our common stock instead of cash as consideration for    future earn-out obligations, and we may agree to issue such    additional securities in connection with other future    acquisitions; which, if issued, would dilute your share    ownership and could lead to volatility in our common stock    price.     We grow our business organically as well as through    acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise    funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of    additional equity securities. In connection with certain    completed acquisitions, we have the option to issue shares of    our common stock instead of cash for certain earn-out    obligations, provided we first register those shares for resale,    including one such obligation for which our earn-out obligation    is unlimited. In addition, in connection with our acquisition of    Wanzek we issued 7.5 million shares and $55.0 million    in principal amount of 8% convertible notes and granted the    sellers certain registration rights. Our Amended and Restated    Articles of Incorporation provide that we may issue up to a    total 100,000,000 shares of common stock, of which    75,454,565 shares were outstanding as of December 31,    2008. We may also agree to issue additional securities in    connection with future acquisitions. Such issuances could have    the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our    existing shareholders individual ownership percentages and    could lead to volatility in our common stock price. A    small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to    influence major corporate decisions.     Jorge Mas, our Chairman, Jose Mas, our President and Chief    Executive Officer, and other members of the Mas family who are    employed by MasTec, beneficially owned approximately 29.3% of    the outstanding shares of our common stock as of    December 31, 2008. Accordingly, they are in a position to    influence:           the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders,    including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or    substantially all of our assets;           the nomination of individuals to our Board of Directors; and           a change in our control.     These factors may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover    attempt that you might consider in your best interest or that    might result in you receiving a premium for your common stock.    24Table of ContentsOur    articles of incorporation and certain provisions of Florida law    contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult    to effect a change in our control.     Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws    and the Florida Business Corporation Act, or the FBCA, could    delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the    replacement of our incumbent directors and management, even if    doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders by providing    them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a    premium over the then market price of our common stock. For    example, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.    At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only    have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the    directors on our Board of Directors. Consequently, it will take    at least two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in    control of our Board of Directors, which may discourage hostile    takeover bids. In addition, our articles of incorporation    authorize our Board of Directors, without further shareholder    approval, to issue preferred stock. The issuance of preferred    stock could also dilute the voting power of the holders of our    common stock, including by the grant of voting control to    others, which could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in    control. "
18,MTZ,MASTEC INC,2008-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the otherinformation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risksfacing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deemto be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. If any of theserisks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer andthe trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Customers IndustriesAn economic downturn or reduced capital expenditures in the industries we serve may result in adecrease in demand for our services.     Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continuing into 2008, a number of key economicindicators including the Consumer Confidence Index, US Leading Index, Consumer Price Index (CPI),and total new housing starts have been trending downward and pointing in the direction of apotential economic downturn during 2008. Because we have been negatively impacted by previouseconomic downturns, we constantly monitor our customers industries and their relative healthcompared to the economy as a whole. The aforementioned reduction in new housing starts, should itcontinue during 2008, could negatively impact our customers who utilize our services to constructtheir last mile of infrastructure. Continued reductions in new housing starts, which generallyfollow overall economic trends, could result in the cancellation of certain projects or a reductionin the utilization of our services until these sectors of the economy improve. Additionally, ourcustomers who provide satellite communications to consumers across the country could be adverselyimpacted by an economic downturn if new subscriptions and upgrades for new and existing consumersare not ordered at the rate that we and our customers anticipate. Moreover, during an economicdownturn, our customers may not have the ability or desire to continue to fund capitalexpenditures for infrastructure at their current levels. A decrease in either last mile projects,new subscriptions and upgrades or any other services we provide could adversely affect our resultsof operations, cash flows and liquidity.Many of the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatorychange, and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could reduce demandfor our services.     We derive, and anticipate that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of ourrevenue from customers in the communications industry. The communications industry is subject torapid changes in technology and governmental regulation. Changes in technology may reduce thedemand for the services we provide. New or developing technologies could displace the wire linesystems used for the transmission of voice, video and data, and improvements in existing technologymay allow communications10Table of Contentsproviders to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them.Additionally, the communications industry has been characterized by a high level of consolidationthat may result in the loss of one or more of our customers. Utilities have also entered into aphase of consolidation similar to the communications industry which could lead to the sameuncertainties.Our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financialperformance.     Our industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with other companies in most of the marketsin which we operate, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firmsservicing regional and national markets. We also face competition from existing or prospectivecustomers that employ in-house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide.There are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and, as a result,any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise andskilled personnel may become one of our competitors.     Most of our customers work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often theprincipal factor in determining which service provider is selected, especially on smaller, lesscomplex projects. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based onprice alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers, and the loss of one of thesecustomers or a reduction in their demand for our services could impair our financial performance.     Forthe year ended December 31, 2007, we derived approximately 44.1%, 9.1% and 6.8% of ourrevenue from DIRECTV®, Verizon, and AT&T, respectively. In the year ended December 31,2006, we derived approximately 37.5%, 10.2% and 8.3% of our revenue from DIRECTV®, AT&T,and Verizon, respectively. In addition, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately76.7%, 76.4% and 74.4% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,respectively.     Because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers, our revenue couldsignificantly decline if we lose one or more of these customers or if the amount of business weobtain from them is reduced, which could result in reduced profitability and liquidity.Our profitability and liquidity could decline if certain customers reduce the amounts they pay forour services or if our customers are unable to pay for our services.     In the past, we incurred significant losses after a number of customers filed for bankruptcyor experienced financial difficulties following a general economic downturn and certain industryspecific factors that worsened the impact of the overall economic downturn on those customers. SeeRisks Related to Our Industry and Our Customers Industries, specifically the risk factorentitled An economic downturn or reduced capital expenditures in the industries we serve mayresult in a decrease in demand for our services. In 2007, 2006 and 2005 total provisions for baddebts aggregated to $17.6 million, $10.0 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of which $14.1million, $7.9 million and $3.7 million, respectively, resulted from anticipated legal settlementsand discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2007, we had remaining receivables from customersundergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling $1.6 million, of which $0.3 million is included inspecific reserves for bad debts, with the remaining amounts expected to be recovered throughsecured and unsecured claims and enforcement of liens or bonds.Most of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects orother work with us.     A significant portion of our revenue is derived from multi-year master service agreements andother service agreements. Under our multi-year master service agreements and other serviceagreements, we contract to provide customers with individual project services, through work orders,within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis. Under these agreements, our customers have noobligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. A significant decline inthe projects customers assign us under these service agreements could result in a decline in ourrevenue, profitability and liquidity.11Table of Contents     We recorded an unrealized loss in 2007 to reduce the carrying value of certain auction ratesecurities we hold, and we may incur additional impairment charges with respect to auction ratesecurities in future periods.     The current overall credit concerns in capital markets may affect our ability to liquidate certainsecurities that we classify as securities available for sale on our balance sheet. As of December31, 2007, we have identified approximately $16.2 million of investments subject to this auctionprocess for which there have been insufficient bidders at the scheduled rollover dates and heldanother approximately $33.0 million of these securities. As a result, we recorded an unrealizedloss of $4.8 million in 2007. Subsequent to year end, of the approximately $33.0 million of thesesecurities, approximately $8.5 million were sold at par, approximately $7.9 million hadinsufficient bidders and failed the reset process, and we believe the remaining approximately $16.6million may be at risk of having this occur. While theinvestments are of a high credit quality and the rating of these securities has not been lowered,at this time we are uncertain when the liquidity issues associated with these investments willimprove, when we will be able to exit these investments at their parvalue or whether we will incurany additional losses as a result of these investments. See Note 5 in Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.Most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, so our revenue is not guaranteed.     Most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice, ranging from immediate cancellation tocancellation upon 180 days notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Many of ourcontracts, including our service agreements, are periodically open to public bid. We may not be thesuccessful bidder on our existing contracts that are re-bid. We also provide a significant portionof our services on a non-recurring, project-by-project basis. We could experience a reduction inour revenue, profitability and liquidity if:  our customers cancel a significant number of contracts;   we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re-bid; or   we complete the required work under a significant number of our non-recurring projectsand cannot replace them with similar projects.We may not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services provided under fixed-pricecontracts which could impair our financial performance.     A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from master service agreements and otherservice agreements that are fixed price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of ourservices on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with ourperformance may be greater than we anticipated. In addition to master or other service agreementswe enter into contracts that require installation or construction of specified units within aninfrastructure system. Under those agreements, we have also contractually agreed to a price perunit. Profitability will be reduced if the actual costs to complete each unit exceed originalestimates. We are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of any estimated costs onthese projects if estimated costs to complete the remaining units for the projects exceed therevenue to be earned on such units.     Our profitability is therefore dependent upon our ability to accurately estimate the costsassociated with our services. These costs may be affected by a variety of factors, such as lowerthan anticipated productivity, conditions at the work sites differing materially from what wasanticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costs of materials and labor. Certainagreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated or losses if actual costs for ourcontracts exceed our estimates, which could reduce our profitability and liquidity.We recognize revenue for our installation/construction fixed price contracts using thepercentage-of-completion method, therefore, variations of actual results from our assumptions mayreduce our profitability.     We recognize revenue on long-term installation/construction fixed price contracts using thepercentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record revenue aswork on the contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at aspecified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to datebear to estimated total contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method therefore relies onestimates of total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewedand revised periodically as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue inthe fiscal period when such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on managements reasonableassumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Variation of actual results from estimates on alarge project or on a number of smaller projects could be material. We immediately recognize thefull amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss. Suchadjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impactour liquidity. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we incurredapproximately $0.3 million, $6.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of losses onpercentage-of-completion contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, $6.5 millionand $2.3 million, respectively, were included in loss from discontinued operations.12Table of ContentsAmounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits.     Approximately 85.3% of our 18-month backlog at December 31, 2007 was comprised of masterservice agreements and other service agreements which do not require our customers to purchase aminimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice. These backlog amounts are based onour estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originallyanticipated period, or at all. In addition, contracts included in our backlog may not beprofitable. We may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delaysor cancellations resulting from weather conditions, external market factors and economic factorsbeyond our control. If our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in ourrevenue, profitability and liquidity.Our business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns ofour customers, exposing us to variable quarterly results.     The budgetary years of many of our specialty infrastructure services customers end December31. As a result, some of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towardsthe end of the year. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, also affectour ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of the United States. As a result, weexperience reduced revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year.     Natural catastrophes such as hurricanes in the United States could also have a negative impacton the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affected regions orutilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions, which could result in a decline inprofitability and liquidity.We are self-insured against many potential liabilities.     Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability, generalliability, workers compensation and employee group health claims, those policies are subject tohigh deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. Since most claimsagainst us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectivelyself-insured for substantially all claims. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaidclaims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, and reflect thoseliabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non-current liabilities. The determination ofsuch claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updatedquarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the manyrelevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, thedetermination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reportedand the effectiveness of our safety program. If our insurance claims increase or costs exceed ourestimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.Increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce ourprofitability, liquidity and availability under our credit facility.     Because of factors such as increases in claims, projected significant increases in medicalcosts and wages, lost compensation and reductions in coverage, insurance carriers may be unwillingto continue to provide us with our current levels of coverage without a significant increase ininsurance premiums or collateral requirements to cover our deductible obligations. An increase inpremiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity aswell as reduce availability under our revolving credit facility.We may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings and theneed for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility.     Some of our contracts require performance and surety bonds. Bonding capacity in theinfrastructure industry has become increasingly difficult to obtain, and bonding companies aredenying or restricting coverage to an increasing number of contractors. Companies that have beensuccessful in renewing or obtaining coverage have sometimes been required to post additionalcollateral to secure the same amount of bonds which reduces availability under our credit facility.We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which couldpreclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certaincustomers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or paymentbonds in the future, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bondswhich would reduce availability under our credit facility. We reported net losses for the past sixyears. If we continue to incur net losses, our overall level of bonding capacity could be reduced.13Table of ContentsWe have agreed to keep certain liabilities related to the state Department of Transportationrelated projects and assets that were sold in February 2007.     In connection with the sale of our state Department of Transportation related projects andassets and the related settlement explained in Item 1  Business  Recent Developments, we agreedto keep certain liabilities, mainly related to the cost to maintain and continue certainperformance and payment bonds, certain obligations under leases between the parties and certainother litigation matters. We may also be unable to recover any losses we incur as a result of anythird party claims to the extent any third parties seek payment from us directly and we are unableto recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification obligations contained in theRevised Amended Agreement; including, in the event the buyer were financially unable to meetcertain obligations, any losses resulting from creditor claims.     Under the terms of the Revised Amended Agreement, the buyer is no longer required to issue astandby letter of credit in our favor in February 2008 to cover any remaining exposure related toour bonded obligations. Instead, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement, the buyerentered into indemnity agreements directly with certain surety bonding companies in connection withour bonded obligations. Therefore, if the buyer is unable to meet its contractual obligations, thesurety bonding company can seek its remedies under the indemnity agreement. If the surety bondingcompany, however, pays the amounts due under the bonds, the surety bonding company will seekreimbursement of such payment from us. Accordingly, we may incur losses in the future related tothese contingent liabilities if the buyer does not complete the bonded contracts and we are unableto recover such losses from the buyer pursuant to the indemnification provisions contained in theRevised Amended Agreement. At December 31, 2007, we estimate that the cost to complete on the$161.8 million in performance and payment bonds related to these projects and assets was $8.4million.We may incur goodwill impairment charges in our reporting entities which could harm ourprofitability.     In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, No. 142, Goodwill and OtherIntangible Assets, or SFAS No. 142, we periodically review the carrying values of our goodwillto determine whether such carrying values exceed the fair market value. In the year ended December31, 2005, we charged $11.5 million, against goodwill related to the decision to sell substantiallyall of our state Department of Transportation related projects and assets. In connection with ourdecision to sell substantially all our Canadian net assets, we wrote off goodwill associated withthis entity in the amount of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. We may incuradditional impairment charges related to goodwill in any of our reporting entities in the future ifthe markets they serve or their business deteriorates.We may incur restructuring charges which could reduce our profitability.     From time to time we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability. We couldincur charges in the future as a result of:  eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business strategy;   reducing or eliminating services that do not produce adequate revenue or margin;   reducing costs of businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but need margin improvements; and   reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources.     All charges related to restructuring would be reflected as operating expenses and could reduceour profitability.14Table of ContentsOur revolving credit facility and senior notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us fromengaging in transactions that might benefit us, including responding to changing business andeconomic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.     At December 31, 2006, we had $121.0 million in senior subordinated notes outstanding dueFebruary 2008 under an indenture. Since then we have issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior notesdue 2017, under a new indenture, the proceeds of which we used to redeem the senior subordinatednotes due February 2008. We also have a $150.0 million revolving credit facility of which we had nooutstanding cash draws at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, the net availability under thecredit facility was approximately $44.0 million which includes outstanding standby letters ofcredit aggregating $86.4 million. The terms of our indebtedness contain customary events ofdefault and covenants that prohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certainfinancial tests or obtaining the consent of the lenders. The prohibited actions include, amongother things:  making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts;   incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts;   paying cash dividends;   creating certain liens against our assets;   prepaying our other indebtedness, excluding the senior notes;   engaging in certain mergers or combinations; and   engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control (as defined in the credit facility and indenture).     Our credit facility provides that if our net borrowing base availability falls below $15.0million we must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. See Item 7. ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition,Liquidity and Capital Resources. In the past, we have not been in compliance with certainfinancial covenants of our credit facility and have had to seek amendments or waivers from ourlenders. Should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility, wewould be required to obtain further modifications of the facility or secure another source offinancing to continue to operate our business. A default could result in the acceleration of eitherour obligations under the credit facility or under the indenture relating to the senior notes, orboth. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us,including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing,if needed. Our business is capital intensive and, to the extent we need additional financing, wemay not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms, which may decrease ourprofitability and liquidity.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees, we will be unableto operate efficiently which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.     Our business is labor intensive, and some of our operations experience a high rate of employeeturnover. At times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve, it can be difficult for us tofind qualified and affordable personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient skilledlabor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy. Our labor expensesmay increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. If we are unable to hireemployees with the requisite skills, we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses.Additionally, our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and isdependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management. Labor shortages, increased labor ortraining costs or the loss of key personnel could result in reduced revenue, profitability andliquidity.Increases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins.     The price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuatesbased on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oiland gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producingcountries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Most of our contracts do notallow us to adjust our pricing. Accordingly, any increase in fuel costs could reduce ourprofitability and liquidity.We may choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay, or delaypaying, us for the related services.     We use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow. In somecases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If wechoose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail topay, or delay paying us for the related work, we could experience a decrease in profitability andliquidity.15Table of ContentsOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.     Some of the work we perform is in underground environments. If the field location mapssupplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated onthe field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil containingpollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants. In such a case, we may be liablefor fines and damages.     We own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these facilitiescontain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, wecould be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.     We sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitiveterrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it ispossible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurfacematerials. These releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law,potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines.     We are currently engaged in litigation related to environmental liabilities in Coos Bay,Oregon. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.     In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws andregulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of newclean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new orincreased liabilities that could negatively impact our profitability and liquidity.Our failure to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration the U.S. Department of Transportation and other state and local agencies thatoversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.     The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or OSHA, establishes certainemployer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likelyto cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements.Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolitionwork, may apply to our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital andoperating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying withOSHA and other state and local laws and regulations.     We have, from time to time, received notice from the U.S. Department of Transportation thatour motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safetyperformance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges. If wecannot successfully resolve these issues, our ability to service our customers could be damagedwhich could lead to a reduction of our revenue, profitability and liquidity.Our financial results are based, in part, upon estimates and assumptions that may differ fromactual results.     In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the United States, a number of estimates and assumptions are made bymanagement that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates andassumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of ourfinancial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a highdegree of precision from data available. In some cases, these estimates are particularly uncertainand we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of therevenue recognition for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, allowance for doubtfulaccounts, accrued self-insured claims, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, asset livesused in computing depreciation and amortization, including amortization of intangibles, andaccounting for performance-based stock awards, income taxes (including net deferred tax assets),contingencies and litigation. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates andassumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,results of operations and cash flows.Our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken ourfinancial condition.     Construction projects undertaken by our employees involve exposure to electrical lines,pipelines carrying potentially explosive materials, heavy equipment, mechanical failures andadverse weather conditions. If serious accidents or fatalities occur, we may be restricted frombidding on certain work and certain existing contracts could be terminated. In addition, if oursafety record were to deteriorate, our ability to bid on certain work could suffer. The occurrenceof accidents in our business could result in significantliabilities or harm our ability to perform under our contracts or enter into new contractswith customers, which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.16Table of ContentsMany of our communications customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations orchanges to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contractingservices and the profitability of those services.     Many of our communications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission,or the FCC. The FCC may interpret the application of its regulations to communication companiesin a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and mayimpose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on ourcommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, thendemand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced.Claims, lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken ourfinancial condition.     We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary courseof business, including those described in Item 3. Legal Proceeding. Claimants may seek largedamage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs. When appropriate, we establishreserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information,legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from timeto time according to case developments. If our reserves are inadequate, or if in the future ourinsurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilitiesfor which we self-insure, we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity. Anadverse determination on any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, claims, lawsuits andproceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating ourbusiness. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.Acquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity.     We have made, and in the future plan to make, strategic acquisitions. However, we may not beable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or may be unable to obtain the consent of ourlenders and therefore not be able to complete such acquisitions. We may pay for acquisitions withour common stock which may dilute your investment in our common stock or decide to pursueacquisitions that investors may not agree with. In addition, acquisitions may expose us tooperational challenges and risks, including:  the ability to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate theacquired business operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems intoour business;   increased indebtedness and contingent purchase price obligations associated with anacquisition;   the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is notrealized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseeninternal difficulties;   the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;   diversion of managements attention; and   the ability to hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.     A failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with orresulting from acquisitions could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity.Borrowings associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtednesswhich could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms.We may incur significant costs as a result of our lawsuit with our excess insurance carrier.     In the second quarter of 2004, several complaints for a purported securities class action werefiled against us and certain of our officers. We have settled these actions without payments to theplaintiffs by us. As part of the settlement, our excess insurance carrier has retained its rightsto seek up to $2.0 million in reimbursement from us based on its claim that notice was not properlygiven under the policy. We may be unable to successfully resolve this dispute without incurringsignificant expense. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.17Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Company and Our Common StockThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.     From 2001 to 2003, for example, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $24.75 per share inthe first quarter of 2001 to a low of $1.31 per share in the first quarter of 2003. During 2006 and2007, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $16.25 per share to a low of $8.68 per share. Wemay continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. SeeItem 5. Market Information for the Registrants Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters andIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities.     Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:  announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors;   future sales of our common stock or other securities;   announcements of new contracts or customers by us or one of our competitors;   market conditions for providers of services to communications companies, utilities and government;   changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and   announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.     In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations inrecent years that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance ofcompanies. The market price for our common stock has been volatile and such volatility could causethe market price of our common stock to decrease and cause you to lose some or all of yourinvestment in our common stock.A small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporatedecisions.     Jorge Mas, our Chairman, Jose Mas, our CEO, and other members of the Mas family who areemployed by MasTec, beneficially own approximately 32.7% of the outstanding shares of our commonstock as of February 25, 2008. Accordingly, they are in a position to influence:  the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders, including any merger,consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;   the nomination of individuals to our Board of Directors; and   a change in our control.     These factors may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that you might consider inyour best interest or that might result in you receiving a premium for your common stock.Our articles of incorporation and certain provisions of Florida law contain anti-takeoverprovisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control.     Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the Florida BusinessCorporation Act could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement ofour incumbent directors and management, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders byproviding them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then marketprice of our common stock. For example, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. Atany annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appointapproximately one-third of the directors on our Board of Directors. Consequently, it will take atleast two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our Board of Directors,which may discourage hostile takeover bids. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorizeour Board of Directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock. Theissuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock,including by the grant of voting control to others, which could delay or prevent an acquisition orchange in control.18Table of Contents"
17,MTZ,MASTEC INC,2007-03-08,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the otherinformation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risksfacing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deemto be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. If any of thefollowing risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations couldsuffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Customers IndustriesAn economic downturn or reduced capital expenditures in the industries we serve may result in adecrease in demand for our services.     Commencing in 2001 and through 2003, the communications industry suffered a severe downturnthat resulted in a number of our customers filing for bankruptcy protection or experiencingfinancial difficulties. The downturn resulted in reduced capital expenditures for infrastructureprojects, even among those customers that did not experience financial difficulties. Although ourstrategy is to increase the percentage of our business derived from large, financially stablecustomers in the communications and utility industries, these customers may not continue to fundcapital expenditures for infrastructure projects at current levels. Even if they do continue tofund projects, we may not be able to increase our share of their business. Bankruptcies ordecreases in our customers capital expenditures and disbursements could reduce our revenue,profitability or liquidity.Many of the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatorychange, and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could reduce demandfor our services.     We derive, and anticipate that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of ourrevenue from customers in the communications industry. The communications industry is subject torapid changes in technology and governmental regulation. Changes in technology may reduce thedemand for the services we provide. New or developing technologies could displace the wire linesystems used for the transmission of voice, video and data, and improvements in existing technologymay allow communications providers to significantly improve their networks without physicallyupgrading them. Additionally, the communications industry has been characterized by a high level ofconsolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers. Utilities have alsoentered into a phase of consolidation similar to the communications industry which could lead tothe same uncertainties.Our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financialperformance.     Our industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with other companies in most of the marketsin which we operate, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firmsservicing regional and national markets. We also face competition from existing or prospectivecustomers that employ in-house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide.There are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and, as a result,any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise andskilled personnel may become one of our competitors.     Most of our customers work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often theprincipal factor in determining which service provider is selected, especially on smaller, lesscomplex projects. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based onprice alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements.11Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our BusinessWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers, and the loss of one of thesecustomers or a reduction in their demand, the amount they pay or their ability to pay, for ourservices could impair our financial performance.     In the year ended December 31, 2006, we derived approximately 37.3%, 9.5% and 8.2% of ourrevenue from DIRECTV®, BellSouth (now AT&T) and Verizon, respectively. In the year endedDecember 31, 2005, we derived approximately 31.8%, 10.2% and 10.0% of our revenue fromDIRECTV®, BellSouth (now AT&T) and Verizon, respectively. In addition, our ten largestcustomers accounted for approximately 75.0%, 71.3% and 71.1% of our revenue in the years endedDecember 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.     Because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers, our revenue couldsignificantly decline if we lose one or more of these customers or if the amount of business weobtain from them is reduced, which could result in reduced profitability and liquidity. Forexample, we experienced a decrease of $103.9 million in revenue from Comcast in the year endedDecember 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 due to the completion of the rebuild andupgrade of their broadband networks in 2004 and we experienced a decrease of $9.6 million inrevenue for Verizon in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the same period in 2005 due totiming of generating work orders. Our revenue, profitability and liquidity could decline if certaincustomers reduce the amounts they pay for our services or if our customers are unable to pay forour services. A number of our customers filed for bankruptcy protection or experienced financialdifficulties commencing in 2001 through 2003 during the last economic downturn in thecommunications industry which negatively impacted our revenue, profitability and liquidity. In2006, 2005 and 2004 total provisions for bad debts aggregated to $10.0 million, $4.9 million and$5.1 million, respectively, of which $8.1 million, $3.3 million and $0.6 million, respectively, areincluded in loss from discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2006, we had remaining receivables fromcustomers undergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling $10.4 million, of which $4.1 million isincluded in specific reserves for bad debts, with the remaining amounts expected to be recoveredthrough secured and unsecured claims and enforcement of liens or bonds.Most of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects orother work with us.     A significant portion of our revenue is derived from multi-year master service agreements andother service agreements. Under our multi-year master service agreements and other serviceagreements, we contract to provide customers with individual project services, through work orders,within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis. Under these agreements, our customers have noobligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. A significant decline inthe projects customers assign us under these service agreements could result in a decline in ourrevenue, profitability and liquidity.Most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, so our revenue is not guaranteed.     Most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice, ranging from immediate cancellation tocancellation upon 180 days notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Many of ourcontracts, including our service agreements, are periodically open to public bid. We may not be thesuccessful bidder on our existing contracts that are re-bid. We also provide a significant portionof our services on a non-recurring, project-by-project basis. We could experience a reduction inour revenue, profitability and liquidity if:  our customers cancel a significant number of contracts;   we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re-bid; or   we complete the required work under a significant number of our non-recurring projectsand cannot replace them with similar projects.We may not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services provided under fixed-pricecontracts which could impair our financial performance.     A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from master service agreements and otherservice agreements that are fixed price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of ourservices on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with ourperformance may be greater than we anticipated. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon ourability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services. These costs may be affectedby a variety of factors, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at the work sitesdiffering materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costsof materials and labor. Certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated orlosses if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates, which could reduce our profitabilityand liquidity.12Table of ContentsWe account for a majority of our projects using units-of-delivery methods orpercentage-of-completion, therefore variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduceour profitability.     For installation/construction projects, we recognize revenue on projects on theunits-of-delivery or percentage-of-completion methods, depending on the type of project. Werecognize revenue on unit based projects using the units-of-delivery method. Under theunits-of-delivery method, revenue is recognized as the units are completed at the contractuallyagreed price per unit. Our profitability is reduced if the actual cost to complete each unitexceeds our original estimates. We are also required to immediately recognize the full amount ofany estimated loss on these projects if the estimated costs to complete the remaining units for theproject exceed the revenue to be earned on such units. For certain customers with unit basedconstruction/installation contracts, we recognize revenue only after the service is performed andas the related work orders are approved. Revenue from completed work orders not collected inaccordance with the payment terms established with these customers is not recognized untilcollection is assured. If we are required to recognize a loss on a project, we could experiencereduced profitability which could negatively impact our liquidity.     We recognize revenue on non-unit based fixed price contracts using thepercentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record revenue aswork on the contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at aspecified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to datebear to estimated total contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method therefore relies onestimates of total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewedand revised periodically as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue inthe fiscal period when such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on managements reasonableassumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Variation of actual results from estimates on alarge project or on a number of smaller projects could be material. We immediately recognize thefull amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss. Suchadjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impactour liquidity. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 we incurredapproximately $6.8 million, $3.3 million and $7.8 million, respectively, of losses onpercentage-of-completion contracts, of which $6.5 million, $2.3 million and $3.7 million,respectively, were included in loss from discontinued operations.Amounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits.     Approximately 85.5% of our 18-month backlog at December 31, 2006 was comprised of masterservice agreements and other service agreements which do not require our customers to purchase aminimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice. These backlog amounts are based onour estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originallyanticipated period or at all. In addition, contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable.We may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays orcancellations resulting from weather conditions, external market factors and economic factorsbeyond our control. If our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in ourrevenue, profitability and liquidity.Our business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns ofour customers, exposing us to variable quarterly results.     The budgetary years of many of our specialty infrastructure services customers end December31. As a result, some of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towardsthe end of the year. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, also affectour ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of the United States. As a result, weexperience reduced revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year.     Natural catastrophes such as the recent hurricanes in the United States could also have anegative impact on the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affectedregions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions, which in turn couldsignificantly impact the results of any one or more of our reporting periods.We are self-insured against many potential liabilities.     Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability, generalliability, workers compensation and employee group health claims, those policies are subject tohigh deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. Since most claimsagainst us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectivelyself-insured for substantially all claims. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaidclaims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, and reflect thoseliabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non-current liabilities. The determination ofsuch claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updatedquarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the manyrelevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, thedetermination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reportedand the effectiveness of13Table of Contentsour safety program. If our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates ofinsurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.Increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce ourprofitability, liquidity and credit facility availability.     Because of factors such as increases in claims (primarily workers compensation claims),projected significant increases in medical costs and wages, lost compensation and reductions incoverage, insurance carriers may be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels ofcoverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums or collateral requirements to coverour deductible obligations. For example, in connection with our 2005 insurance program, we paid ourinsurance carrier $18.0 million for cash collateral during 2005. In January 2006, we provided toour insurance carrier a $6.5 million letter of credit related to our insurance plans. In addition,in November 2006, we provided our insurance carrier with an $18.0 million letter of credit with theinsurance carrier returning cash collateral of $18.0 million plus all accrued interest to us. Ascollateral for this letter of credit, we pledged $18.0 million in cash to our lenders under ourrevolving credit facility. An increase in premiums or collateral requirements could significantlyreduce our profitability and liquidity as well as reduce availability under our revolving creditfacility.We may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings and theneed for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility.     Some of our contracts require performance and surety bonds. Bonding capacity in theinfrastructure industry has become increasingly difficult to obtain, and bonding companies aredenying or restricting coverage to an increasing number of contractors. Companies that have beensuccessful in renewing or obtaining coverage have sometimes been required to post additionalcollateral to secure the same amount of bonds which reduces availability under our credit facility.We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which couldpreclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certaincustomers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or paymentbonds in the future, we may be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bondswhich would reduce availability under our credit facility. We reported net losses for the past sixyears. If we continue to incur net losses, our overall level of bonding capacity could be reduced.We have agreed to keep certain liabilities related to the state Department of Transportationrelated projects and assets that were sold in February 2007.     In connection with the sale of our state Department of Transportation related projects andassets, we agreed to keep certain related liabilities, including certain litigation and the cost tomaintain and continue certain performance and payment bonds. At December 31, 2006, the cost tocomplete on the $207.2 million in performance and payment bonds related to these projects andassets was $21.0 million. While the buyer of the stateDepartment of Transportation related projects has indemnified us forall contracts and liabilities sold, and has agreed to issue a standbyletter of credit in our favor in February 2008 to cover anyremaining exposure, if the buyerwere unable to meet its contractual obligations to a customer and the surety paid the amount dueunder the bond, the surety would seek reimbursement of such payment from us. Accordingly, it ispossible that we may incur losses in the future related to these retained liabilities.New accounting pronouncements including SFAS 123R may significantly impact our future results ofoperations and earnings per share.     Prior to January 2006, we accounted for our stock-based award plans to employees and directorsin accordance with Accounting Principals Board Opinion No. 25 (APB No. 25), Accounting for StockIssued to Employees, under which compensation expense is recorded to the extent that the currentmarket price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price. Under this method, we generallydid not recognize any compensation related to employee stock option grants we issue under our stockoption plans at fair value. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issuedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment,(SFAS 123R). This statement, which became effective for us beginning on January 1, 2006, requiresus to recognize the expense attributable to stock options granted or vested subsequent to December31, 2005 and has had a material negative impact on our future profitability.     SFAS 123R requires us to recognize share-based compensation as compensation expense in ourstatement of operations based on the fair values of such equity on the date of the grant, with thecompensation expense recognized over the vesting period. This statement also required us to adopt afair value-based method for measuring the compensation expense related to share-based compensation.The impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R on our results of operations resulted in share-basedcompensation expense of approximately $7.6 million in 2006, including $0.2 million fromdiscontinued operations. Future annual share-based compensation expense could be affected by, amongother things, the number of stock options issued annually to employees and directors, volatility ofour stock price and the exercise price of the options granted. Future changes in generally acceptedaccounting principles may also have a significant effect on our reported results.14Table of ContentsWe may incur goodwill impairment charges in our reporting entities which could harm ourprofitability.     In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS No. 142, weperiodically review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether such carrying valuesexceed the fair market value. In the year ended December 31, 2004, we charged $12.3 million againstgoodwill in connection with the bankruptcy of our Brazilian subsidiary. In the year ended December31, 2005, we charged $11.5 million against goodwill related to the decision to sell substantiallyall of our state Department of Transportation related projects and assets. These impairment chargesare included in our consolidated statements of operations under discontinued operations. We mayincur additional impairment charges related to goodwill in any of our reporting entities in thefuture if the markets they serve or their business deteriorates.We may incur long-lived assets impairment charges which could harm our profitability.     In accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-LivedAssets, or SFAS No. 144, we review long-lived assets for impairment. In analyzing potentialimpairment of our state Department of Transportation related projects and assets we usedprojections of future discounted cash flows from these assets in 2006 and estimated a selling priceby using a weighted probability cash flow analysis based on managements estimates, as well as ournegotiations with third parties for the sale of these assets which we sold effective February 1,2007.We may incur restructuring charges which could reduce our profitability.     From time to time we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability. We couldincur charges in the future as a result of:  eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business strategy;   reducing or eliminating services that do not produce adequate revenue or margin;   reducing costs of businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but need margin improvements; and   reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources.     All charges related to restructuring would be reflected as operating expenses and could reduceour profitability.Our revolving credit facility and senior notes impose restrictions on us which may prevent us fromengaging in transactions that might benefit us, including responding to changing business andeconomic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.     At December 31, 2006, we had $121.0 million in senior subordinated notes outstanding dueFebruary 2008 under an indenture and $9.2 million in other notes payable outstanding. Since then wehave issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior notes due 2017, under a newindenture, the proceeds of which we used to redeem the senior subordinated notes due 2008. We alsohave a $150.0 million revolving credit facility of which we had no outstanding cash draws atDecember 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, the net availability under the credit facility wasapproximately $35.1 million which includes outstanding standby letters of credit aggregating $83.3million. The terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants thatprohibit us from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining theconsent of the lenders. The prohibited actions include, among other things:  making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts;   incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts;   paying cash dividends;   making capital expenditures in excess of a specified amount;   creating certain liens against our assets;   prepaying our other indebtedness, including the senior notes;   engaging in certain mergers or combinations; and15Table of Contents  engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control (as defined in the credit facility and indenture).     Our credit facility provides that if our net borrowing base availability falls below $20.0million we must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. See Item 7. ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition,Liquidity and Capital Resources. In the past, we have not been in compliance with certainfinancial covenants of our credit facility and have had to seek amendments or waivers from ourlenders. Should we be unable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility, wewould be required to obtain further modifications of the facility or secure another source offinancing to continue to operate our business. A default could result in the acceleration of eitherour obligations under the credit facility or under the indenture relating to the senior notes, orboth. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us,including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing,if needed. Our business is capital intensive and, to the extent we need additional financing, wemay not be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms, which may decrease ourprofitability and liquidity.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees, we will be unableto operate efficiently which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.     Our business is labor intensive, and some of our operations experience a high rate of employeeturnover. At times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve, it can be difficult for us tofind qualified and affordable personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient skilledlabor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy. Our labor expensesmay increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. If we are unable to hireemployees with the requisite skills, we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses.Additionally, our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and isdependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management. Labor shortages, increased labor ortraining costs or the loss of key personnel could result in reduced revenue, profitability andliquidity.Increases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins.     The price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuatesbased on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oiland gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producingcountries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. Most of our contracts do notallow us to adjust our pricing. Accordingly, any increase in fuel costs could reduce ourprofitability and liquidity.We may choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay, or delaypaying, us for the related services.     We use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow. In somecases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If wechoose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail topay, or delay paying us for the related work, we could experience a decrease in profitability andliquidity.Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.     Some of the work we perform is in underground environments. If the field location mapssupplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated onthe field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil containingpollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants. In such a case, we may be liablefor fines and damages.     We own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these facilitiescontain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, wecould be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.     We sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitiveterrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it ispossible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurfacematerials. These releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law,potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines.     We are currently engaged in litigation related to environmental liabilities in Coos Bay,Oregon. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.     In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws andregulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of newclean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new orincreased liabilities that could negatively impact our profitability and liquidity.16Table of ContentsOur failure to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration the U.S. Department of Transportation and other state and local agencies thatoversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.     The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or OSHA, establishes certainemployer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likelyto cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements.Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolitionwork, may apply to our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital andoperating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying withOSHA and other state and local laws and regulations.     We have, from time to time, received notice from the U.S. Department of Transportation thatour motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safetyperformance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges. If wecannot successfully resolve these issues, our ability to service our customers could be damagedwhich could lead to a reduction of our revenue, profitability and liquidity.Our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken ourfinancial condition.     Construction projects undertaken by our employees involve exposure to electrical lines,pipelines carrying potentially explosive materials, heavy equipment, mechanical failures andadverse weather conditions. If serious accidents or fatalities occur, we may be restricted frombidding on certain work and certain existing contracts could be terminated. In addition, if oursafety record were to deteriorate, our ability to bid on certain work could suffer. The occurrenceof accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities or harm our ability to performunder our contracts or enter into new contracts with customers, which could reduce our revenue,profitability and liquidity.Many of our communications customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations orchanges to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contractingservices and the profitability of those services.     Many of our communications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission,or the FCC. The FCC may interpret the application of its regulations to communication companiesin a manner that is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and mayimpose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on ourcommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, thendemand for our specialty contracting services may be reduced.Claims, lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken ourfinancial condition.     We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary courseof business, including those described in Item 3. Legal Proceeding. Claimants may seek largedamage awards and defending claims can involve significant costs. When appropriate, we establishreserves against these items that we believe to be adequate in the light of current information,legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage, and we adjust such reserves from timeto time according to case developments. If our reserves are inadequate, or if in the future ourinsurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liabilitiesfor which we self-insure, we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity. Anadverse determination on any such claim, lawsuit or proceeding could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, claims, lawsuits andproceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating ourbusiness. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.Acquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity.     We have made, and in the future plan to make, strategic acquisitions. However, we may not beable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or may be unable to obtain the consent of ourlenders and therefore not be able to complete such acquisitions. We may pay for acquisitions withour common stock which may dilute your investment in our common stock or decide to pursueacquisitions that investors may not agree with. In addition, acquisitions may expose us tooperational challenges and risks, including:  the ability to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate theacquired business operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems intoour business;   increased indebtedness associated with an acquisition;17Table of Contents  the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is notrealized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseeninternal difficulties;   the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;   diversion of managements attention; and   the ability to hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.     A failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with orresulting from acquisitions could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity.Borrowings associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtednesswhich could impact our ability to service our debt within the scheduled repayment terms.We may incur significant costs as a result of our lawsuit with our excess insurance carrier.     In the second quarter of 2004, several complaints for a purported securities class action werefiled against us and certain of our officers. We have settled these actions without payments to theplaintiffs by us. As part of the settlement, our excess insurance carrier has retained its rightsto seek up to $2.0 million in reimbursement from us based on its claim that notice was not properlygiven under the policy. We may be unable to successfully resolve this dispute without incurringsignificant expense. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.Risks Related to Our Company and Our Common StockThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.     From 2001 to 2003, for example, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $24.75 per share inthe first quarter of 2001 to a low of $1.31 per share in the first quarter of 2003. During 2006 and2005, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $14.75 per share to a low of $6.56 per share. Wemay continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock. SeeItem 5. Market Information for the RegistrantsCommon Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases ofEquity Securities.     Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:  announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors;   future sales of our common stock or other securities;   announcements of new contracts or customers by us or one of our competitors;   market conditions for providers of services to communications companies, utilities and government;   changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and   announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.     In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations inrecent years that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance ofcompanies. The market price for our common stock has been volatile and such volatility could causethe market price of our common stock to decrease and cause you to lose some or all of yourinvestment in our common stock.A small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporatedecisions.     Jorge Mas, our Chairman, and other members of his family who are employed by MasTecbeneficially own approximately 33.7% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of March 5,2007. Accordingly, they are in a position to influence:  the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders, including any merger,consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;   the nomination of individuals to our Board of Directors; and   a change in our control.18Table of Contents     These factors may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that you might consider inyour best interest or that might result in you receiving a premium for your common stock.Our articles of incorporation and certain provisions of Florida law contain anti-takeoverprovisions that may make it more difficult to effect a change in our control.     Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the Florida BusinessCorporation Act could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement ofour incumbent directors and management, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders byproviding them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then marketprice of our common stock. For example, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. Atany annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appointapproximately one-third of the directors on our Board of Directors. Consequently, it will take atleast two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our Board of Directors,which may discourage hostile takeover bids. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorizeour Board of Directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock. Theissuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of the holders of our common stock,including by the grant of voting control to others, which could delay or prevent an acquisition orchange in control"
16,MTZ,MASTEC INC,2006-03-01,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the otherinformation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of ourcommon stock could decline.Risks Related to Our Industry and Our Customers IndustriesAn economic downturn or reduced capital expenditures in the industries we serve may result in adecrease in demand for our services.11Table of Contents     Commencing in 2001 and through 2003, the communications industry suffered a severe downturnthat resulted in a number of our customers filing for bankruptcy protection or experiencingfinancial difficulties. The downturn resulted in reduced capital expenditures for infrastructureprojects, even among those customers that did not experience financial difficulties. Although ourstrategy is to increase the percentage of our business derived from large, financially stablecustomers in the communications and utility industries, these customers may not continue to fundcapital expenditures for infrastructure projects at current levels. Even if they do continue tofund projects, we may not be able to increase our share of their business. Bankruptcies ordecreases in our customers capital expenditures and disbursements could reduce our revenue,profitability or liquidity.Many of the industries we serve are subject to consolidation and rapid technological and regulatorychange, and our inability or failure to adjust to our customers changing needs could reduce demandfor our services.     We derive, and anticipate that we will continue to derive, a substantial portion of ourrevenue from customers in the communications industry. The communications industry is subject torapid changes in technology and governmental regulation. Changes in technology may reduce thedemand for the services we provide. New or developing technologies could displace the wire linesystems used for the transmission of voice, video and data, and improvements in existing technologymay allow communications providers to significantly improve their networks without physicallyupgrading them. Additionally, the communications industry has been characterized by a high level ofconsolidation that may result in the loss of one or more of our customers. Utilities have alsoentered into a phase of consolidation similar to the communications industry which could lead tothe same uncertainties.Our industry is highly competitive which may reduce our market share and harm our financialperformance.     Our industry is highly fragmented, and we compete with other companies in most of the marketsin which we operate, ranging from small independent firms servicing local markets to larger firmsservicing regional and national markets. We also face competition from existing or prospectivecustomers that employ in-house personnel to perform some of the same types of services we provide.There are relatively few barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and, as a result,any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise andskilled personnel may become one of our competitors.     Most of our customers work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often theprincipal factor in determining which service provider is selected, especially on smaller, lesscomplex projects. Smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for these projects based onprice alone due to their lower costs and financial return requirements.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few customers, and the loss of one of thesecustomers or a reduction in their demand, the amount they pay or their ability to pay, for ourservices could impair our financial performance.     In the year ended December 31, 2005, we derived approximately 31.8%, 10.2% and 10.0% of ourrevenue from DIRECTV®, BellSouth and Verizon Communications, respectively. In the yearended December 31, 2004, we derived approximately 24.3% and 13.9% of our revenue fromDIRECTV® and Comcast Cable Communications, Inc. respectively. In addition, our largest10 customers accounted for approximately 63.9%, 71.1% and 71.3% of our revenue in the years endedDecember 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively.     Because our business is concentrated among relatively few major customers, our revenue couldsignificantly decline if we lose one or more of these customers or if the amount of business weobtain from them is reduced, which could result in reduced profitability and liquidity. Forexample, we experienced a decrease of $103.9 million in revenue for Comcast in the year endedDecember 31, 2005 compared to the same period in 2004 due to the completion of the rebuild andupgrade of their broadband networks in 2004. Our revenue, profitability and liquidity could declineif certain customers reduce the amounts they pay for our services or if our customers are unable topay for our services. A number of our customers filed for bankruptcy protection or experiencedfinancial difficulties commencing in 2001 through 2003 during the last economic downturn in thecommunications industry which negatively impacted our revenue, profitability and liquidity. In2003, 2004 and 2005 total provisions for bad debts aggregated to $8.8 million, $5.1 million and$4.9 million, respectively, and were reflected in part in continuing operations and in part indiscontinued operations. As of December 31, 2005, we had remaining receivables from customersundergoing bankruptcy reorganization totaling $14.5 million, of which $8.0 million is included inspecific reserves for bad debts, with the remaining amounts expected to be recovered throughsecured and unsecured claims and enforcement of liens or bonds.12Table of ContentsMost of our contracts do not obligate our customers to undertake any infrastructure projects orother work with us.     A significant portion of our revenue is derived from multi-year master service agreements andother service agreements. Under our multi-year master service agreements and other serviceagreements, we contract to provide customers with individual project services, through work orders,within defined geographic areas on a fixed fee basis. Under these agreements, our customers have noobligation to undertake any infrastructure projects or other work with us. A significant decline inthe projects customers assign us under these service agreements could result in a decline in ourrevenue, profitability and liquidity.Most of our contracts may be canceled on short notice, so our revenue is not guaranteed.     Most of our contracts are cancelable on short notice, ranging from immediate cancellation tocancellation upon 180 days notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. Many of ourcontracts, including our service agreements, are periodically open to public bid. We may not be thesuccessful bidder on our existing contracts that are re-bid. We also provide a significant portionof our services on a non-recurring, project-by-project basis. We could experience a reduction inour revenue, profitability and liquidity if:  our customers cancel a significant number of contracts;   we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re-bid; or   we complete the required work under a significant number of our non-recurring projectsand cannot replace them with similar projects.We may not accurately estimate the costs associated with our services provided under fixed-pricecontracts which could impair our financial performance.     A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from master service agreements and otherservice agreements that are fixed price contracts. Under these contracts, we set the price of ourservices on a per unit or aggregate basis and assume the risk that the costs associated with ourperformance may be greater than we anticipated. Our profitability is therefore dependent upon ourability to accurately estimate the costs associated with our services. These costs may be affectedby a variety of factors, such as lower than anticipated productivity, conditions at the work sitesdiffering materially from what was anticipated at the time we bid on the contract and higher costsof materials and labor. Certain agreements or projects could have lower margins than anticipated orlosses if actual costs for our contracts exceed our estimates, which could reduce our profitabilityand liquidity.We account for a majority of our projects using units-of-delivery methods orpercentage-of-completion, therefore variations of actual results from our assumptions may reduceour profitability.     For installation/construction projects, we recognize revenue on projects on theunits-of-delivery or percentage-of-completion methods, depending on the type of project. Werecognize revenue on unit based projects using the units-of-delivery method. Under theunits-of-delivery method, revenue is recognized as the units are completed at the contractuallyagreed price per unit. Our profitability is reduced if the actual cost to complete each unitexceeds our original estimates. We are also required to immediately recognize the full amount ofany estimated loss on these projects if the estimated costs to complete the remaining units for theproject exceed the revenue to be earned on such units. For certain customers with unit basedconstruction/installation contracts, we recognize revenue only after the service is performed andas the related work orders are approved. Revenue from completed work orders not collected inaccordance with the payment terms established with these customers is not recognized untilcollection is assured. If we are required to recognize a loss on a project, we could experiencereduced profitability which could negatively impact our liquidity.     We recognize revenue on non-unit based fixed price contracts using thepercentage-of-completion method. Under the percentage-of-completion method, we record revenue aswork on the contract progresses. The cumulative amount of revenue recorded on a contract at aspecified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenue that incurred costs to datebear to estimated total contract costs. The percentage-of-completion method therefore relies onestimates of total expected contract costs. Contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewedand revised periodically as the work progresses. Adjustments are reflected in contract revenue inthe fiscal period when such estimates are revised. Estimates are based on managements reasonableassumptions and experience, but are only estimates. Variation of actual results from estimates on alarge project or on a number of smaller projects could be material. We immediately recognize thefull amount of the estimated loss on a contract when our estimates indicate such a loss. Suchadjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability which could negatively impactour liquidity. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005 we incurredapproximately $7.8 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of losses on percentage-of-completioncontracts a part of which were included in continuing operations and a part in discontinuedoperations.13Table of ContentsAmounts included in our backlog may not result in actual revenue or translate into profits.     Approximately 69.3% of our 18-month backlog at December 31, 2005 was comprised of masterservice agreements and other service agreements which do not require our customers to purchase aminimum amount of services and are cancelable on short notice. These backlog amounts are based onour estimates and therefore may not result in actual receipt of revenue in the originallyanticipated period or at all. In addition, contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable.We may experience variances in the realization of our backlog because of project delays orcancellations resulting from weather conditions, external market factors and economic factorsbeyond our control. If our backlog fails to materialize, we could experience a reduction in ourrevenue, profitability and liquidity.Our business is seasonal and is affected by adverse weather conditions and the spending patterns ofour customers, exposing us to variable quarterly results.     The budgetary years of many of our specialty infrastructure services customers end December31. As a result, some of our customers reduce their expenditures and work order requests towardsthe end of the year. Adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter season, also affectour ability to perform outdoor services in certain regions of the United States and Canada. As aresult, we experience reduced revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year.     Natural catastrophes such as the recent hurricanes in the United States could also have anegative impact on the economy overall and on our ability to perform outdoor services in affectedregions or utilize equipment and crews stationed in those regions, which in turn couldsignificantly impact the results of any one or more of our reporting periods.We are self-insured against many potential liabilities.     Although we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability, generalliability, workers compensation and employee group health claims, those policies are subject tohigh deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. Since most claimsagainst us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectivelyself-insured for substantially all claims. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaidclaims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, and reflect thoseliabilities in our balance sheet as other current and non-current liabilities. The determination ofsuch claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updatedquarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the manyrelevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, thedetermination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reportedand the effectiveness of our safety program. If our insurance claims increase or costs exceed ourestimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.Increases in our insurance premiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce ourprofitability, liquidity and credit facility availability.     Because of factors such as increases in claims (primarily workers compensation claims),projected significant increases in medical costs and wages, lost compensation and reductions incoverage, insurance carriers may be unwilling to continue to provide us with our current levels ofcoverage without a significant increase in insurance premiums or collateral requirements to coverour deductible obligations. For example, in connection with our 2005 insurance program, we paid ourinsurance carrier $18.0 million for cash collateral. In January 2006, we provided to our insurancecarrier a $6.5 million letter of credit related to our 2006 insurance plans. An increase inpremiums or collateral requirements could significantly reduce our profitability and liquidity aswell as reduce availability under our revolving credit facility.We may be unable to obtain sufficient bonding capacity to support certain service offerings and theneed for performance and surety bonds may reduce our availability under our credit facility.     Some of our contracts require performance and surety bonds. Bonding capacity in theinfrastructure industry has become increasingly difficult to obtain, and bonding companies aredenying or restricting coverage to an increasing number of contractors. Companies that have beensuccessful in renewing or obtaining coverage have sometimes been required to post additionalcollateral to secure the same amount of bonds which reduces availability under our credit facility.We may not be able to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which couldpreclude us from being able to bid for certain contracts and successfully contract with certaincustomers. In addition, even if we are able to successfully renew or obtain performance or paymentbonds in the future, we14Table of Contentsmay be required to post letters of credit in connection with the bonds which would reduceavailability under our credit facility. We reported net losses for the years ended December 31,2003, 2004, and 2005. If we continue to incur net losses, our overall level of bonding capacitycould be reduced.New accounting pronouncements including SFAS 123R may significantly impact our future results ofoperations and earnings per share.     Prior to January 2006, we accounted for our stock-based award plans to employees and directorsin accordance with APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees under which compensationexpense is recorded to the extent that the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds theexercise price. Under this method, we generally did not recognize any compensation related toemployee stock option grants we issue under our stock option plans at fair value. In December 2004,the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 123R Share-Based Payment or SFAS 123R. Thisstatement, which was effective for us beginning on January 1, 2006, will require us to recognizethe expense attributable to stock options granted or vested subsequent to December 31, 2005 andwill have a material negative impact on our future profitability.     SFAS 123R will require us to recognize share-based compensation as compensation expense in ourstatement of operations based on the fair values of such equity on the date of the grant, with thecompensation expense recognized over the vesting period. This statement also required us to adopt afair value-based method for measuring the compensation expense related to share-based compensation.We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R on our results of operations and weexpect share-based compensation expense to be at least $2.5 million annually. The actual annualshare-based compensation expense could be affected by, among other things, the number of stockoptions issued annually to employees and directors, volatility of our stock price and the exerciseprice of the options granted. The adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material negative impact on ourprofitability. Future changes in generally accepted accounting principles may also have asignificant effect on our reported results.We may incur goodwill impairment charges in our reporting entities which could harm ourprofitability.     In accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, or SFAS No. 142, weperiodically review the carrying values of our goodwill to determine whether such carrying valuesexceed the fair market value. In the year ended December 31, 2004, we charged $12.3 million againstgoodwill in connection with the bankruptcy of our Brazilian subsidiary. In the year ended December31, 2005, we charged $11.5 million against goodwill related to the decision to sell substantiallyall of our state Department of Transportation related projects and assets. These impairment chargesare included in our consolidated statements of operations under discontinued operations. We mayincur additional impairment charges related to goodwill in any of our reporting entities in thefuture if the markets they serve or their business deteriorates.We may incur long-lived assets impairment charges which could harm our profitability.     In accordance with SFAS No. 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-LivedAssets, or SFAS No. 144, we review long-lived assets for impairment. In analyzing potentialimpairment of our state Department of Transportation related projects and assets we usedprojections of future discounted cash flows from these assets in 2006 and estimated a selling priceby using a weighted probability cash flow analysis based on managements estimates. These estimatesare all subject to changes in the future and if we are not able to sell these projects and assetsat the estimated selling price or our cash flow changes because of changes in economic conditions,growth rates or changes in terminal values, we may incur additional impairment charges in thefuture related to these operations.We may incur restructuring charges which could reduce our profitability.     From time to time we review our operations in an effort to improve profitability. We couldincur charges in the future as a result of:  eliminating service offerings that no longer fit into our business strategy;   reducing or eliminating services that do not produce adequate revenue or margin;   reducing costs of businesses that provide adequate profit contributions but need margin improvements; and   reviewing new business opportunities capable of utilizing our existing human and physical resources.15Table of Contents     All charges related to restructuring would be reflected as operating expenses and could reduceour profitability.Our revolving credit facility and senior subordinated notes impose restrictions on us which mayprevent us from engaging in transactions that might benefit us, including responding to changingbusiness and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.     At December 31, 2005, we had $195.9 million in senior subordinated notes outstanding dueFebruary 2008 under an indenture and $0.3 million in other notes payable outstanding. We also havea $150.0 million revolving credit facility of which $4.2 million was outstanding at December 31,2005. The terms of our indebtedness contain customary events of default and covenants that prohibitus from taking certain actions without satisfying certain financial tests or obtaining the consentof the lenders. The prohibited actions include, among other things:  making investments and acquisitions in excess of specified amounts;   incurring additional indebtedness in excess of specified amounts;   paying cash dividends;   making capital expenditures in excess of a specified amount;   creating certain liens against our assets;   prepaying our other indebtedness, including the senior subordinated notes;   engaging in certain mergers or combinations; and   engaging in transactions that would result in a change of control (as defined in the credit facility and indenture).     Our credit facility provides that if our net borrowing base availability falls below $20.0million we must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. See Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Financial Condition, Liquidity andCapital Resources. In the past, we have not been in compliance with certain financial covenants ofour credit facility and have had to seek amendments or waivers from our lenders. Should we beunable to comply with the terms and covenants of our credit facility, we would be required toobtain further modifications of the facility or secure another source of financing to continue tooperate our business. A default could result in the acceleration of either our obligations underthe credit facility or under the indenture relating to the senior subordinated notes, or both. Inaddition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, includingresponding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, ifneeded. Our business is capital intensive and, to the extent we need additional financing, we maynot be able to obtain such financing at all or on favorable terms, which may decrease ourprofitability and liquidity.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers and skilled employees, we will be unableto operate efficiently which could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.     Our business is labor intensive, and some of our operations experience a high rate of employeeturnover. At times of low unemployment rates in the areas we serve, it can be difficult for us tofind qualified and affordable personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain a sufficient skilledlabor force necessary to support our operating requirements and growth strategy. Our labor expensesmay increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. If we are unable to hireemployees with the requisite skills, we may also be forced to incur significant training expenses.Additionally, our business is managed by a number of key executive and operational officers and isdependent upon retaining and recruiting qualified management. Labor shortages, increased labor ortraining costs or the loss of key personnel could result in reduced revenue, profitability andliquidity.Increases in the costs of fuel could reduce our operating margins.     The price of fuel needed to run our vehicles and equipment is unpredictable and fluctuatesbased on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oiland gas, actions by OPEC and other oil and gas producers, war and16Table of Contentsunrest in oil producing countries, regional production patterns and environmental concerns.Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing. Accordingly, any increase in fuelcosts could reduce our profitability and liquidity.We may choose, or be required, to pay our subcontractors even if our customers do not pay, or delaypaying, us for the related services.     We use subcontractors to perform portions of our services and to manage work flow. In somecases, we pay our subcontractors before our customers pay us for the related services. If wechoose, or are required, to pay our subcontractors for work performed for customers who fail topay, or delay paying us for the related work, we could experience a decrease in profitability andliquidity.Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.     Some of the work we perform is in underground environments. If the field location mapssupplied to us are not accurate, or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated onthe field location maps, our underground work could strike objects in the soil containingpollutants and result in a rupture and discharge of pollutants. In such a case, we may be liablefor fines and damages.     We own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment. Some of these facilitiescontain fuel storage tanks which may be above or below ground. If these tanks were to leak, wecould be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines.     We sometimes perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitiveterrains and water bodies. Due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies, it ispossible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture releasing subsurfacematerials. These releases may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law,potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines.     We are currently engaged in litigation related to environmental liabilities in Coos Bay,Oregon. See Legal Proceedings.     In addition, new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws andregulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of newclean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new orincreased liabilities that could negatively impact our profitability and liquidity.Our failure to comply with the regulations of the U.S. Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration the U.S. Department of Transportation and other state and local agencies thatoversee transportation and safety compliance could reduce our revenue, profitability and liquidity.     The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, or OSHA, establishes certainemployer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likelyto cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration and various record keeping, disclosure and procedural requirements.Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolitionwork, may apply to our operations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital andoperating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying withOSHA and other state and local laws and regulations.     We have, from time to time, received notice from the U.S. Department of Transportation thatour motor carrier operations will be monitored and that the failure to improve our safetyperformance could result in suspension or revocation of vehicle registration privileges. If wecannot successfully resolve these issues, our ability to service our customers could be damagedwhich could lead to a reduction of our revenue, profitability and liquidity.Our business is subject to hazards that could result in substantial liabilities and weaken ourfinancial condition.     Construction projects undertaken by our employees involve exposure to electrical lines,pipelines carrying potentially explosive materials, heavy equipment, mechanical failures andadverse weather conditions. If serious accidents or fatalities occur, we may be restricted frombidding on certain work and certain existing contracts could be terminated. In addition, if oursafety record were to deteriorate, our ability to bid on certain work could suffer. The occurrenceof accidents in our business could result in significant liabilities or harm our ability to performunder our contracts or enter into new contracts with customers, which could reduce our revenue,profitability and liquidity.17Table of ContentsMany of our communications customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations orchanges to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty contractingservices and the profitability of those services.     Many of our communications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission.The FCC may interpret the application of its regulations to communication companies in a mannerthat is different than the way such regulations are currently interpreted and may impose additionalregulations. If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our communications customersand adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, then demand for our specialtycontracting services may be reduced.Claims, lawsuits and proceedings could reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken ourfinancial condition.     We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and proceedings which arise in the ordinary courseof business. Claimants may seek large damage awards and defending claims can involve significantcosts. When appropriate, we establish reserves against these items that we believe to be adequatein the light of current information, legal advice and professional indemnity insurance coverage,and we adjust such reserves from time to time according to case developments. If our reserves areinadequate, or if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable orthere is an increase in liabilities for which we self-insure, we could experience a reduction inour profitability and liquidity. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm ourreputation or divert management resources away from operating our business. See LegalProceedings.Acquisitions involve risks that could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity.     We have made, and in the future plan to make, strategic acquisitions. However, we may not beable to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or may be unable to obtain the consent of ourlenders and therefore not be able to complete such acquisitions. We may decide to pay foracquisitions with our common stock which may dilute your investment in our common stock or decideto pursue acquisitions that investors may not agree with. In addition, acquisitions may expose usto operational challenges and risks, including:  the ability to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate theacquired business operations and financial reporting and accounting control systems intoour business;   increased indebtedness associated with an acquisition;   the ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is notrealized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseeninternal difficulties;   the availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;   diversion of managements attention; and   the ability to hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations.     A failure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with orresulting from acquisitions could result in a reduction of our profitability and liquidity.Borrowings associated with these acquisitions may also result in higher levels of indebtednesswhich could impact our ability to service the debt within the scheduled repayment terms.Risks Related to Our Company and Our Common StockWe may incur significant damages and expenses due to the purported class action complaints thatwere filed against us and certain of our officers.     In the second quarter of 2004, several complaints for a purported securities class action werefiled against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the SouthernDistrict of Florida and one was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern Districtof New York. These cases have been consolidated in the Southern District of Florida. The complaintsallege certain violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, asamended, related to current and prior period earnings reports. In addition, in December 2004 aderivative action based on the same factual predicate as the purported securities class actions wasfiled by a shareholder. We may be unable to successfully resolve these disputes without incurringsignificant expenses. See Legal Proceedings.18Table of ContentsThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.     From 2001 to 2003, for example, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $24.75 in the firstquarter of 2001 to a low of $1.31 in the first quarter of 2003. During 2004 and 2005, our commonstock fluctuated from a high of $16.50 to a low of $3.63. We may continue to experience significantvolatility in the market price of our common stock. See Price Range of Common Stock and DividendPolicy.     Numerous factors could have a significant effect on the price of our common stock, including:  announcements of fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors;   future sales of our common stock or other securities;   announcements of new contracts or customers by us or one of our competitors;   market conditions for providers of services to communications companies, utilities and government;   changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and   announcements of acquisitions by us or one of our competitors.     In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations inrecent years that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance ofcompanies. The market price for our common stock has been volatile and could also cause the marketprice of our common stock to decrease and cause you to lose some or all of your investment in ourcommon stock.A small number of our existing shareholders have the ability to influence major corporatedecisions.     Jorge Mas, our Chairman, and other members of his family who are employed by MasTecbeneficially own approximately 34.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of February17, 2006. Accordingly, they are in a position to influence:  the vote of most matters submitted to our shareholders, including any merger,consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets;   the nomination of individuals to our Board of Directors; and   a change in our control.     These factors may discourage, delay or prevent a takeover attempt that you might consider inyour best interest or that might result in you receiving a premium for your common stock.Our articles of incorporation and Florida law contain anti-takeover provisions that may make itmore difficult to effect a change in our control.     Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the Florida BusinessCorporation Act could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement ofour incumbent directors and management, even if doing so might be beneficial to our shareholders byproviding them with the opportunity to sell their shares possibly at a premium over the then marketprice of our common stock. For example, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. Atany annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appointapproximately one-third of the directors on our Board of Directors. Consequently, it will take atleast two annual shareholder meetings to effect a change in control of our Board of Directors,which may discourage hostile takeover bids. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorizeour Board of Directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock. Theissuance of preferred stock could also dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock,including by the grant of voting control to others, which could delay or prevent an acquisition orchange in control.19Table of Contents"
