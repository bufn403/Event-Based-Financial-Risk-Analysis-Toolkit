.The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.SummaryThe principal risk factors that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation include:•Regulatory risks, including the impact that applicable laws, rules and regulations in the highly-regulated and supervised financial services industry, as well as changes to or in the application, interpretation or enforcement of those laws, rules and regulations, can have on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, including JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs associated with assessments, levies or other governmental charges; the ways in which differences in financial services regulation and supervision in different jurisdictions or with respect to certain competitors can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s business; the penalties and collateral consequences, and higher compliance and operational costs, that JPMorgan Chase may incur when resolving a regulatory investigation; the ways in which less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks in certain jurisdictions can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results; and the losses that security holders will absorb if JPMorgan Chase were to enter into a resolution.•Political risks, including the potential negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses due to economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments.•Market risks, including the effects that economic and market events and conditions, governmental policies, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and market fluctuations can have on JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale businesses and its investment and market-making positions and on JPMorgan Chase’s earnings and its liquidity and capital levels.•Credit risks, including potential negative effects from adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, customers, counterparties, custodians and central counterparties; the potential for losses due to declines in the value of collateral in stressed market conditions; and potential negative impacts from concentrations of credit risk with respect to clients, customers, counterparties and other market participants.•Liquidity risks, including the risk that JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired by market-wide illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, the inability to sell assets, default by a significant market participant, unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase; the dependence of JPMorgan Chase & Co. on the cash flows of its subsidiaries; and the potential adverse effects that any downgrade in any of JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may have on its liquidity and cost of funding.•Capital risks, including the risk that any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to support its business activities.•Operational risks, including risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s dependence on its operational systems, its ability to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces and the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees, as well as the systems and employees of third parties, market participants and service providers; the potential negative effects of failing to identify and address operational risks related to the failure of internal or external operational systems, the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms or the adoption of new technologies; legal and regulatory risks related to safeguarding personal information; the harm that could be caused by a successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase or by other extraordinary events; risks related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of First Republic Bank; risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework and control environment, its models and estimations and associated judgments used in its stress testing and financial statements, and controls over disclosure and financial reporting; and potential adverse effects of failing to comply with heightened regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers.•Strategic risks, including the damage to JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results that could occur if management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies; risks associated with the significant and increasing competition that JPMorgan Chase faces; and the potential adverse impacts of climate change on JPMorgan Chase’s business operations, clients and customers.•Conduct risks, including the negative impact that can result from the actions or misconduct of employees, including any failure of employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices.•Reputation risks, including the potential adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with its clients, 9Part Icustomers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders that could arise from employee misconduct, security breaches, inadequate risk management, compliance or operational failures, litigation and regulatory investigations, failure to satisfy expectations concerning environmental, social and governance concerns, failure to effectively manage conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations, or other factors that could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.•Country risks, including potential impacts on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses from an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region; and the potential adverse effects of local economic, political, regulatory and social factors on JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in certain countries in which it operates.•People risks, including the criticality of attracting and retaining qualified and diverse employees; and the potential adverse effects of unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies on JPMorgan Chase’s workforce.•Legal risks, including those relating to litigation and regulatory and government investigations.The above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below.RegulatoryJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business, and financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject to extensive and constantly-evolving regulation and supervision.The regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase significantly affects the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations, and JPMorgan Chase could be required to make changes to its business and operations in response to supervisory expectations or decisions or to new or changed laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs or experiencing a reduction in revenues to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules, and regulations.In response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be, required to:•limit the products and services that it offers•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities•refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue•pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations•incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.Any failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject could result in:•increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny•regulatory and governmental enforcement actions•the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions•increased exposure to litigation, or•harm to its reputation.Differences and inconsistencies in financial services regulation and supervision can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, operations and financial results.The content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms can vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:•larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent supervision, regulation and regulatory scrutiny•financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or •the financial services regulatory and supervisory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.These types of differences in the regulatory and supervisory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.10There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory or supervisory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.In addition, certain national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict with or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risk of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed, as well as regulatory expectations, relating to:•the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries•requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries•the implementation of processes within locally-based subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory requirements or expectations•the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities•requirements for the orderly resolution of financial institutions•requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”), or for depositing funds with other financial institutions or clearing and settlement systems•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives•governance and accountability regimes•conduct of business and control requirements, and•restrictions on compensation.These types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:•divest assets or restructure its operations•maintain higher levels of capital and liquidity, or absorb increased capital and liquidity costs •incur higher operational and compliance costs •change the prices that it charges for its products and services •curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients•curtail other business opportunities, including acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise would have pursued•become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or•incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations.JPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs, including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation or needing to comply with other restrictions. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:•greater exposure in litigation•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or•other direct and indirect adverse effects.Furthermore, government officials in the U.S. and other countries have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:11Part I•loss of clients, customers and business•restrictions on offering certain products or services, and •losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.JPMorgan Chase expects that: •it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions•governmental authorities will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions; and  •governmental authorities will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions.If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:•enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions•pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to higher costs or requests for additional capital in connection with the resolution of governmental investigations and enforcement actions involving newly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in jurisdictions with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.JPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries, states, municipalities, territories and other jurisdictions in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions•conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of intellectual property rights or contractual or other obligations•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive •the threat of regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions that are arbitrary or otherwise contrary to established legal principles in other parts of the world, and  •the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in any jurisdiction is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that jurisdiction. For example, conducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in jurisdictions that have less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses.JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan by these agencies may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.12If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. The agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy. Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either: •in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  •in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.   Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.  PoliticalEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political or geopolitical developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions, could significantly affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets, including:•an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities•monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions•fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending•actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken•governmental actions or initiatives relating to climate risk, or more generally, the impact of business activities on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, and the management of climate and other ESG-related risks•isolationist foreign policies•economic or financial sanctions•the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or•other governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures.These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency 13Part I•provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations •increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time•lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. GSEs”)•result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries •increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole•adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, or•cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.These factors could lead to:•slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession•greater market volatility•a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads •erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets •diminished investor and consumer confidence•lower investments in a particular country or sector of the economy•large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries•reduced commercial activity among trading partners•the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country•the possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution or formation of, a political or economic alliance or treaty•potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, including client assets, or •other market dislocations, including unfavorable economic conditions that could spread from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase the allowance for credit losses or lead to higher net charge-offs, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition or credit rating.JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations may also be adversely affected by actions or initiatives by national, state or local governmental authorities that:•seek to discourage financial institutions from doing business with companies engaged in certain industries, or conversely, to penalize financial institutions that elect not to do business with such companies, or•mandate specific business practices that companies operating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.Because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase may face negative consequences regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not to take, including:•restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental entities in a jurisdiction•the threat of enforcement actions, including under antitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and•harm to its reputation arising from public criticism, including from politicians, activists and other stakeholders.JPMorgan Chase has been prohibited from engaging in certain business activities in specific jurisdictions as a result of these types of governmental actions, and there is no assurance that it will not face similar restrictions on its business and operations in the future.In addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or ability to transact with clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, could be adversely affected if its decisions with respect to doing business with companies in certain sensitive industries are perceived to harm those companies or to align with particular political viewpoints. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's participation in or association with certain environmental and social industry groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or governmental authorities as boycotting or other discriminatory business behavior.MarketEconomic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and investment and market-making positions.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:•investor, consumer and business sentiment•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets•inflation, deflation or recession14•high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market•the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit•levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, as well as the duration of any such changes•the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control, and•the strength of the U.S. and global economies.All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:•severe declines in asset values•unexpected credit events•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)•the inability to effectively hedge risks related to market-making and investment portfolio positions, or•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:•personal and household income distribution•unemployment or underemployment•prolonged periods of exceptionally high or low interest rates•changes in the value of collateral such as residential real estate and vehicles•changes in housing prices•the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services•consumer and small business confidence levels, and•changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt.Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies, including where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:•policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration, employment status and housing•laws, rules and regulations relating specifically to the financial services industry, such as limitations on late payment, overdraft and interchange fees, and•policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses.In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses engaged in capital markets activities, including loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to 15Part Irefinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or•dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuation of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, severe declines in commercial real estate values, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur credit losses on its loans and other commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is or comes under stress.An economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties, including offices, which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions or hybrid work models could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties, impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans and lead to an increase in foreclosures. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio. An increase in foreclosures could result in higher operational risk associated with JPMorgan Chase owning and managing real property, and any inadequacy in governance or control over the foreclosed properties could result in regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings, its liquidity or its capital levels. When interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:•fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans •losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients•the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believe that interest rates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior•losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in the investment securities portfolio•lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings•less liquidity in the financial markets, and•higher funding costs.All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels, and any negative outcomes could be more severe in a prolonged period of high interest rates. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:•net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments16•unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy, and•a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, decreasing revenues.When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.CreditJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, or where clients are unable to access assets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to governmental actions or other factors.A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.Transactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can 17Part Ialso impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant or its ability to fulfill its obligations, can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets, including in circumstances where coordinated action by multiple other market participants is required to address the failure or disruption. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant.JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when:•JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the estimated value of the collateral it holds•collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or•counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons.Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties, or obligors on securities and other financial instruments:•engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries•do business in the same geographic region, or•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of a counterparty, borrower or other obligor could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other counterparties, borrowers or obligors in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses or establish other reserves with respect to certain clients, industries or country exposures in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of counterparties, borrowers or other obligors not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.LiquidityJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained. JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity can be impacted at any given time as a result of factors such as:•market-wide illiquidity or disruption•changes in liquidity or capital requirements resulting from changes in laws, rules and regulations, including those in response to economic effects of systemic events•actions taken by the U.S. government or by the Federal Reserve to reduce its balance sheet, which may reduce 18deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions•inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices•default by a CCP or other significant market participant•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral•unexpected loss of deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements•address obligations under its resolution plan, or•satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the Parent Company. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the Parent Company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the Parent Company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the Parent Company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached, or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Parent Company’s management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the Parent Company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could affect the Parent Company’s ability to:•pay interest on its debt securities•pay dividends on its equity securities•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and•fulfill its other payment obligations.These arrangements could also result in the Parent Company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC are subject.Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:•expected future profitability •risk management practices•legal expenses•ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries•regulatory developments •assumptions about government support, and •economic and geopolitical developments. JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be downgraded in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.19Part IA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:•reducing its access to capital markets •materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities •triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and •decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.CapitalMaintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a Global Systemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage- and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as:•actions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules, and regulations•changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet or developments that could increase RWA, such as increased market risk, customer delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and•increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s SCB.Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, such as:•reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase•requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management strategy•constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or•curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or operations.Banking regulators have released a proposal to amend the Basel III risk-based capital framework which could significantly revise the risk-based capital requirements for banks with assets of $100 billion or more, including JPMorgan Chase. Uncertainty remains as to the manner in which these requirements will ultimately apply to JPMorgan Chase, however it is possible that these requirements could impact JPMorgan Chase’s decisions concerning the business activities in which it will engage and its levels of capital distributions to its shareholders. OperationalJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of internal and external operational systems.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on:•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and•JPMorgan Chase’s ability to continue to maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis in line with technological advancements and evolving security requirements, carefully manage any changes introduced to its systems to maintain security and operational continuity, and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, particularly in regions where JPMorgan Chase may face a heightened risk of malicious activity.JPMorgan Chase has experienced and expects that it will continue to experience failures and disruptions in the stability of its operational systems, including degraded performance of data processing systems, data quality issues, disruptions of network connectivity and malfunctioning software, as well as disruptions in its ability to access and use the operational systems of third parties. These incidents have resulted in various negative effects for customers, including the inability to access account information or to make transactions through ATM, internet or mobile channels, the exfiltration of customer personal data, the recording of duplicative transactions and extended delays for customers requiring services from call 20centers. There can be no assurance that these and other types of operational failures or disruptions will not occur in the future.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage the stability of its operational systems and infrastructure could be hindered by many factors, any of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase and its clients, customers and counterparties, including:•JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively maintain and upgrade systems and infrastructure can become more challenging as the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase•attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers are increasing, evolving and becoming more complex, and during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty, these attempts can be expected to increase in volume•errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, could cause widespread system disruption•failure to detect weaknesses or shortcomings in operational systems in a timely manner•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems could compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues•disruptions in operational systems or in the ability of systems to communicate with each other could be caused by failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors, and•attempts by third parties to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of third parties, including its custodians, vendors (such as those that provide data and cloud computing services, and security and technology services) and other market participants (such as clearing and payment systems, CCPs and securities exchanges), and external operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and processors, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or other parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services.If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, whether authorized or unauthorized, and that party misappropriates that data, this could result in negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including a heightened risk of fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems, losses from fraudulent transactions and reputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business. In addition, the risks associated with the disruption of an operational system of a third party could be exacerbated to the extent that the services provided by that system are used by a significant number or proportion of market participants.The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyber incident or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•delays or other disruptions in providing services, including the provision of liquidity or information to clients and customers•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s ability to execute transactions, including delays or failures in the confirmation or settlement of transactions or in obtaining access to funds or other assets required for settlement•the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously21Part I•financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that has experienced a failure or other disruption •limitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to collect data needed for its business and operations•loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions•dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and •harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of acquired businesses or of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to as “malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These attacks are often designed to:•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•manipulate data•destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems•steal money, or•extort money through the use of so-called “ransomware.”JPMorgan Chase also experiences:•distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt JPMorgan Chase’s websites, including those that provide online banking and other services,•a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions, and•a high volume of disruptions to internet-based services used by JPMorgan Chase that are provided by third parties.JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches because:•the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched or may go undetected for extended periods•cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, well-resourced groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile nation-states that can sustain malicious activities for extended periods, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally•JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and•it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, may gain access to other networks and systems.The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as: •JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services•advances in artificial intelligence, such as the use of machine learning and generative artificial intelligence by malicious actors to develop more advanced social engineering attacks, including targeted phishing attacks•the inability to maintain the security of information transmitted by JPMorgan Chase due to advances in quantum computing that may counteract or nullify existing information protections, and•the acquisition and integration of new businesses.22In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.The dynamic nature of the cyber threat landscape necessitates continuous enhancement and adaptation of cybersecurity controls. Failure to discover or address known vulnerabilities or shortcomings in cybersecurity controls, or to prioritize or complete enhancements to address them, in each case in a timely manner, may leave JPMorgan Chase vulnerable to cyber attacks, potentially resulting in data breaches, financial losses, reputational damage and regulatory penalties, including the failure to prioritize or complete enhancements relating to:•preventing unauthorized access and protecting against the misuse of access, including the maintenance and enhancement of controls related to secure software development practices and identity and access management, such as those relating to the management of administrative access to systems•detecting, escalating and addressing effectively and in a timely manner any vulnerabilities that may be present either in internally-developed software or externally-provided software or services, including vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to exploit unknown security flaws in software and hardware (“zero-day vulnerabilities”)•enhancing early detection of attacks against third-party vendors, including attacks targeting vulnerabilities in third-party open-source software, in support of the secure development and maintenance of internal systems•maintaining and enhancing controls related to technology asset management and inventory systems to prevent the risk of undetected vulnerabilities that could undermine JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate an effective control process •upgrading the coverage and capabilities of systems and controls to protect JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers from the impact of distributed denial-of-service attacks, or to recover from outages that could be caused by a malware or ransomware attack•strengthening network security and management of outbound connections to reduce the risk of data loss •identifying, assessing and mitigating insider threat activities that could lead to the misuse of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or client and customer information, and•integrating acquired businesses where system integration may be complex or may require extensive and lengthy remediation or enhancement of controls.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems•misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators•disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems and those of its clients, customers and counterparties•the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions•demands that JPMorgan Chase pay a ransom to a malicious actor that has perpetrated a cybersecurity breach•unintended violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures•dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers or counterparties•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The extent of a particular cyber attack, the methods and tools used by various actors, and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms or the adoption of new technologies.When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests in a business, makes changes to an existing product, service 23Part Ior delivery platform, or adopts a new technology, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, including increased reliance on third party providers, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:•potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers•higher compliance and operational cost •higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity•regulatory intervention, or •weaker competitive standing.Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations similarly rely on the workforces of third parties, including employees of vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek to acquire. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:•the ineffective implementation of business decisions•any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls•staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets•the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or due to extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control such as natural disasters or an outbreak or escalation of hostilities•a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or•other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses or operations rely.JPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to protect the health and safety of its employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in the processing and safeguarding of personal information.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. Governmental authorities around the world have adopted and are considering the adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data protection and security. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to these laws, rules and regulations could result in fines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change its data-related practices, which could have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide products and otherwise harm its business operations.Implementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:•increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs•hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and •require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Not all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:24•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or•intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties.Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers or employees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations, or any failure to appropriately calibrate, manage and monitor access by employees or third parties to personal information, could subject JPMorgan Chase to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the processing or safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules and regulations can prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from transferring information across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs and operational risk, or restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to customers. Some countries are considering or have adopted legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of JPMorgan Chase’s delivery of products and services. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including material instances of:•cyber attacks•security breaches of its physical premises, including threats to health and safety•power, telecommunications or internet outages, or shutdowns of mass transit•failure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems, including any resulting loss of critical data•damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase•effects of climate change•natural disasters or severe weather conditions•accidents such as explosions or structural failures•health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or•events arising from local or larger-scale civil or political unrest, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or terrorist acts.JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program that is designed to enable it to prepare for, adapt to, withstand and recover from business disruptions that may impact critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology, third party service providers and facilities, in the event of a business disruption, including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business resiliency risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and customers and third parties with which it does business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated. Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control, could:•hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event•cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries25Part I•disrupt market infrastructure systems on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely •expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm its reputation.The occurrence of one or more extraordinary events could also negatively impact the financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, and could lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings.JPMorgan Chase’s acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of First Republic Bank may not result in all of the benefits anticipated.On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC (the “First Republic acquisition”). Actual results associated with the First Republic acquisition may differ from the anticipated positive results, including with respect to:•the settlement of the final purchase price•the total cost of integration•the time required to complete the integration•the overall performance of the assets and liabilities acquired in the First Republic acquisition, or•an improved price for JPMorgan Chase’s common stock.Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and involves the combination of relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. The integration process could result in the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to maintain relationships with clients and customers. In addition, the loss of key employees in connection with the First Republic acquisition could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to successfully conduct its business.JPMorgan Chase could also incur unanticipated costs or losses in connection with the First Republic acquisition, including if JPMorgan Chase fails to comply with the conditions of the shared-loss agreements with the FDIC related to certain loans and lending-related commitments, which could diminish the coverage of the credit losses these agreements are designed to provide.Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:•potential harm to clients and customers, and any liability associated with that harm•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues•increased operational costs, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework and control environment may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems, or in its control environment could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:•hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of Directors•lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase•require significant resources and time to remediate•lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations•attract heightened regulatory scrutiny•expose JPMorgan Chase to litigation, regulatory investigations or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and any liability associated with that harm•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of data, or the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate or untimely risk reporting.26Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or judgments, including those used in its financial statements, are inadequate or incorrect.JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses, including those that use machine learning, artificial intelligence or quantum computing, may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:•reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity•sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.JPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements are inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may experience increased uncertainty in its estimates if assets acquired differ from those used to develop those models, which may lead to unexpected losses.Similarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires significant judgments, including forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers to repay their loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, including when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed. The increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case.Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., requiring continuous enhancements to various disclosures in its financial statements and regulatory reports.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:27Part I•materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition•restrict its ability to access the capital markets •require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase. StrategicIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations. These strategies relate to:•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers•the geographies in which it operates•the types of clients and customers that it serves•the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests•the counterparties with which it does business, and •the methods, distribution channels and third party service providers by or through which it offers products and services. If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:•devise effective business plans and strategies•offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers•allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment•allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations•appropriately assess and monitor principal investments made to enhance or accelerate JPMorgan Chase's business strategies •conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective business acquisitions or investments, or effectively integrate newly-acquired businesses•appropriately address concerns of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, including with respect to climate and other ESG matters•react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs could be material to its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to changes  in financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:•other banks and financial institutions•trading, advisory and investment management firms•finance companies•technology companies, and•other non-bank firms that are engaged in providing similar as well as new products and services.JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. For example, aggressive or less disciplined lending practices by non-bank competitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial services industry and adversely impact other market participants, including JPMorgan Chase.New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-28depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that may not require intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies.Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This competition may be based on quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients to remain competitive.The effects of climate change could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, both directly and as a result of impacts on its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its business, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be adversely affected by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Both physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change could have negative impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and on its exposure to those clients and customers.Physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical cyclones, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as persistent changes in precipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average ambient temperature. Potential adverse impacts of climate-related physical risks include:•declines in asset values, including due to the destruction or degradation of property•reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of JPMorgan Chase•interruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and•population migration or unemployment in affected regions.Transition risks arise from societal adjustment to a low-carbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. Potential adverse impacts of transition risks include:  •sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)•increased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy  •increased energy costs driven by governmental actions and initiatives such as emission pricing and accelerated decarbonization policies•negative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences, and•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including due to any perception that its business practices are contrary to public policy or the preferences of different stakeholders. Climate risks can also arise from inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and financial regulations are implemented in the many regions where JPMorgan Chase operates, including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect. Additionally, internal models and estimations used in climate risk assessments have an increased level of uncertainty due to limited historical trend information and the absence of standardized, reliable and comprehensive greenhouse gas emissions data, which could lead to inaccurate disclosures or financial reporting. ConductConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.29Part IJPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers, counterparties and other market and industry participants, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s Code of Conduct and Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees have not occurred or will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants, employees or others. Some examples of this include:•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading•engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs•facilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers•violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants•using electronic communications channels that have not been approved by JPMorgan Chase•engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace•managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives, and•misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.The consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:•financial losses•increased operational and compliance costs•greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties•regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management•loss of clients or customers, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and practices.ReputationDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, including:•employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace•security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks•failure to safeguard client, customer or employee information•failure to manage risks associated with its client relationships, or with transactions or business activities in which JPMorgan Chase or its clients engage, including transactions or activities that may be unpopular among one or more constituencies30•failure to meet publicly-announced commitments to support ESG initiatives•non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations •operational failures•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions •actions taken in executing regulatory and governmental requirements during a global or regional health emergency, spread of infectious disease, epidemic or pandemic•regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and •failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or other parties, including newly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, or that may be disseminated through disinformation campaigns targeted at JPMorgan Chase. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.Social and environmental activists have been increasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning their business practices, including business relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies:•whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or•whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities. Activists have also taken actions intended to change or influence JPMorgan Chase’s business practices with respect to ESG matters, including public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties, and submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a vote by JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders.In addition, JPMorgan Chase and other companies have been and continue to be criticized by activists, politicians and other members of the public concerning positions taken with respect to matters of public policy. These criticisms can be more widespread during election years in various jurisdictions, and could have the effect of focusing attention on a company such as JPMorgan Chase as part of a wider public debate on public policy matters.These and other types of criticism and actions directed at JPMorgan Chase could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors, employees, government officials and other stakeholders. In all of these cases, JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and its business and results of operations could be harmed by:•greater scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies, or further criticism from politicians and other members of the public•unfavorable coverage or commentary in the media, including through social media campaigns•certain clients and customers ceasing doing business with JPMorgan Chase, and encouraging others to do so•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers, or to hire or retain employees, or•certain investors opting to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan Chase.Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:•consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or•a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers.If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers, employees or other stakeholders.Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation, enforcement actions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related to, the same transaction•identify and address any conflict of interest that a third party with which it is does business may have with respect to a transaction involving JPMorgan Chase•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality31Part I•treat clients and customers fairly and with the appropriate standard of care•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or •handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately and in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations. A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.CountryAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally. Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:•worldwide economic disruption•heightened volatility in financial markets•severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments•sudden increases in prices in the energy and commodity markets or for certain safe haven currencies•substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region•disruption of global trade, and •diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and business activities are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including:•extreme currency fluctuations•high inflation•low or negative growth•defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt and•increased fraud or other misrepresentation of value.The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as:•price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange•expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and•changes in laws, rules and regulations. The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including: •widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general strikes •crime and corruption•security and personal safety issues•an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities•overthrow of incumbent governments•terrorist attacks, and 32•other forms of internal discord. These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.PeopleJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to hire and retain talented and diverse employees could be hindered by factors such as:•the emerging need for more-skilled workers in an evolving labor and workplace environment, including due to changes in technology, and•targeted recruitment of JPMorgan Chase employees by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase’s use of hybrid work models could result in deterioration in employee performance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain employees.Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations.JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.LegalJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions, derivative actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well as criminal proceedings. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.33Parts I and II"
9,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2023-02-21,"Risk Factors
.The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.SummaryThe principal risk factors that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation include:•Regulatory risks, including the impact that applicable laws, rules and regulations in the highly-regulated and supervised financial services industry, as well as changes to or in the application, interpretation or enforcement of those laws, rules and regulations, can have on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations; the ways in which differences in financial services regulation in different jurisdictions or with respect to certain competitors can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s business; the penalties and collateral consequences, and higher compliance and operational costs, that JPMorgan Chase may incur when resolving a regulatory investigation; the ways in which less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks in certain countries can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results; and the losses that security holders will absorb if JPMorgan Chase were to enter into a resolution.•Political risks, including the potential negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses due to economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments.•Market risks, including the effects that economic and market events and conditions, governmental policies, changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and market fluctuations can have on JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale businesses and its investment and market-making positions and on JPMorgan Chase’s earnings and its liquidity and capital levels.•Credit risks, including potential negative effects from adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, customers, counterparties, custodians and central counterparties; and the potential for losses due to declines in the value of collateral in stressed market conditions or from concentrations of credit and market risk.•Liquidity risks, including the risk that JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired by market-wide illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, the inability to sell assets, default by a significant market participant, unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase; the dependence of JPMorgan Chase & Co. on the cash flows of its subsidiaries; the adverse effects that any downgrade in any of JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may have on its liquidity and cost of funding; and potential negative impacts, including litigation risks, associated with the transition to alternative reference rates.•Capital risks, including the risk that any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to support its business activities.•Operational risks, including risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s dependence on its operational systems, its ability to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces and the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees, as well as the systems and employees of third parties, market participants and service providers; the potential negative effects of failing to identify and address operational risks related to the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms; legal and regulatory risks related to safeguarding personal information; the harm that could be caused by a successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase or by other extraordinary events; risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, its models and estimations and associated judgments used in its stress testing and financial statements, and controls over disclosure and financial reporting; and potential adverse effects of failing to comply with heightened regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers.•Strategic risks, including the damage to JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results that could occur if management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies; risks associated with the significant and increasing competition that JPMorgan Chase faces; and the potential adverse impacts of climate change on JPMorgan Chase’s business operations, clients and customers.•Conduct risks, including the negative impact that can result from the actions or misconduct of employees, including any failure of employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices.•Reputation risks, including the potential adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with its clients, customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders that could arise from employee misconduct, security breaches, inadequate risk 9Part Imanagement, compliance or operational failures, litigation and regulatory investigations, failure to satisfy expectations concerning environmental, social and governance concerns, failure to effectively manage conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations, or other factors that could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.•Country risks, including potential impacts on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses from an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region; and the potential adverse effects of local economic, political, regulatory and social factors on JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in certain countries.•People risks, including the criticality of attracting and retaining qualified and diverse employees; and the potential adverse effects of unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies on JPMorgan Chase’s workforce.•Legal risks, including those relating to litigation and regulatory and government investigations.The above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below.RegulatoryJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business, and financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase are subject to extensive regulation and supervision.The regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase significantly affects the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations, and JPMorgan Chase could be required to make changes to its business and operations in response to supervisory expectations or decisions or to new or changed laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules, and regulations.In response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be, required to:•limit the products and services that it offers•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities•refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue•pay higher taxes (including as part of any minimum global tax regime), assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations•incur losses, including with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.Any failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with the laws, rules and regulations to which it is subject could result in:•increased regulatory and supervisory scrutiny•regulatory and governmental enforcement actions•the imposition of fines, penalties or other sanctions•increased exposure to litigation, or•harm to its reputation.Differences and inconsistencies in financial services regulation can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, operations and financial results.The content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:•larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent supervision, regulation and regulatory scrutiny•financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or •the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.These types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For 10example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.In addition, certain national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that may conflict with or prohibit JPMorgan Chase from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risks of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:•the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries•requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries•to implement processes within locally-based subsidiaries to comply with local regulatory requirements•the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities•the resolution of financial institutions•requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives•governance and accountability regimes•conduct of business and control requirements, and•restrictions on compensation.These types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:•divest assets or restructure its operations•absorb increased capital and liquidity costs •incur higher operational and compliance costs •change the prices that it charges for its products and services •curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients•curtail other business opportunities, including acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise would have pursued•become subject to regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or•incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations.JPMorgan Chase is subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory or governmental resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs, including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation, or needing to comply with other restrictions. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:•greater exposure in litigation•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or•other direct and indirect adverse effects.Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:•loss of clients, customers and business•restrictions on offering certain products or services, and •losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.JPMorgan Chase expects that: 11Part I•it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions•governmental authorities will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions; and  •governmental authorities will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions.If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:•enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions•pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.JPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions•conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual property or other obligations•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive •the threat of regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions that are arbitrary or otherwise contrary to established legal principles in other parts of the world, and  •the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in any country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For example, conducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses.JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. The agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy. Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-12absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either: •in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  •in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.   Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.  PoliticalEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. Certain governmental policy initiatives, as well as heightened geopolitical tensions, could significantly affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets, including:•monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions•fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending•actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken•governmental actions or initiatives relating to climate risk, or more generally, the impact of business activities on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, and the management of climate and ESG-related risks•isolationist foreign policies•an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities•economic or financial sanctions•the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or•other governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures.These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency •provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in regulatory, enforcement or diplomatic relations •lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. GSEs”)•increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time13Part I•result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries •increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole•adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, or•cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.These factors could lead to:•slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession•greater market volatility•a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads •erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets •diminished investor and consumer confidence•lower investment growth•large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries•reduced commercial activity among trading partners•the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country•the possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty•potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or •other market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase the allowance for credit losses or lead to higher net charge offs, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations may also be adversely affected by actions or initiatives by national, state or local governmental authorities that:•seek to discourage financial institutions from doing business with companies engaged in certain industries, or conversely, to penalize financial institutions that elect not to do business with such companies, or•mandate specific business practices that companies operating in the relevant jurisdiction must adopt.Because governmental policies in one jurisdiction may differ or conflict with those in other jurisdictions, JPMorgan Chase may face negative consequences regardless of the course of action it takes or elects not to take, including:•restrictions or prohibitions on doing business within a particular jurisdiction, or with governmental entities in a jurisdiction•the threat of enforcement actions, including under antitrust or other anti-competition laws, rules and regulations, and•harm to its reputation arising from public criticism, including from politicians, activists and other stakeholders.In addition, JPMorgan Chase's relationships or ability to transact with clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, could be adversely affected if its decisions with respect to doing business with companies in certain sensitive industries are perceived to harm those companies or to align with particular political viewpoints. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase's participation in or association with certain social and environmental industry groups or initiatives could be viewed by activists or governmental authorities as boycotting or other discriminatory business behavior.MarketEconomic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and investment and market-making positions.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:•investor, consumer and business sentiment•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets•inflation, deflation or recession•high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market•the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit•levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility•the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control, and•the strength of the U.S. and global economies.All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.14In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:•severe declines in asset values•unexpected credit events•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)•the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-making and investment portfolio positions, or•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:•personal and household income distribution•unemployment or underemployment•prolonged periods of exceptionally low or high interest rates•housing prices•the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services•consumer and small business confidence levels, and•changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt.Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:•policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration, employment status and housing, and•policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses.In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwriting. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or•dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur credit losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or 15Part Iholds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.An economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses.Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings, its liquidity or its capital levels. When interest rates are high or increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:•fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans •losses on underwriting exposures or incremental client-specific downgrades, or increases in the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs due to higher financing costs for clients•the loss of deposits, particularly if customers withdraw deposits because they believe that interest rates offered by JPMorgan Chase are lower than those of competitors or if JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior•losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in the investment securities portfolio•lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings•less liquidity in the financial markets, and•higher funding costs.All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:•net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments•unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy, and•a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their 16current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and manage JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.CreditJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, or where clients are unable to access assets held by JPMorgan Chase as custodian due to governmental actions or other factors.A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.Transactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant or its ability to fulfill its obligations, can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets, including in circumstances where coordinated action by multiple other market participants is required to address the failure or disruption. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant.JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when:•JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds•collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or•counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons.Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant 17Part Imarket stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:•engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries•do business in the same geographic region, or•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its ability to diversify or hedge its exposure against those risks may be limited.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted-assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.LiquidityJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained. JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:•market-wide illiquidity or disruption•unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations•inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices•default by a CCP or other significant market participant•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral•unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements•address obligations under its resolution plan, or•satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.18JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding company. The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to:•pay interest on its debt securities•pay dividends on its equity securities•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and•fulfill its other payment obligations.These arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate general, firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:•expected future profitability •risk management practices•legal expenses•ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries•regulatory developments •assumptions about government support, and •economic and geopolitical developments. JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:•reducing its access to capital markets •materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities •triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and •decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.The transition to alternative reference rates could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational risks or litigation and other disputes. Regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in initiatives to introduce and encourage the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain interest rate indices that are deemed to be “benchmarks”, and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants. However, there is no assurance that: •any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace•arrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the transition to alternative reference rates will be fully effective, or•a particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market participants, or that market acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the introduction of other reference rates. 19Part IFor example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are still linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) benchmark, and significant progress has been made by regulators, industry bodies and market participants to introduce and implement the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, if market participants have not implemented effective operational and other arrangements to address the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR to SOFR, this could result in dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and the suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has: •treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments•failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest•made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates•engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or•disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments.These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.CapitalMaintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”), and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as:•actions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules, and regulations•actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S. government in response to the economic effects of systemic events, such as the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage exposure and the GSIB surcharge•changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet or developments that could increase RWA, such as increased market risk, customer delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and•increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s SCB.Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, such as:•reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase•requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management strategy•constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or•curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or operations.OperationalJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective 20functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on:•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and•the ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adherence to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of third parties, including its custodians, vendors (such as those that provide data and cloud computing services, and security and technology services) and other market participants (such as clearing and payment systems, CCPs and securities exchanges). The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•delays or other disruptions in providing services, liquidity or information to clients and customers•the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required•failure to timely settle or confirm transactions•the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences•financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable•client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase’s products and services•limitations on JPMorgan Chase's ability to collect data as required in connection with regulatory or other investigations•regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against JPMorgan Chase•loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:•attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers may increase, evolve or become more complex, particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty•errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues•failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and•third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of newly-acquired businesses or of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to as “malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These attacks are often designed to:•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•manipulate data•destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems21Part I•steal money, or•extort money through the use of so-called “ransomware.”JPMorgan Chase has also experienced:•significant distributed denial-of-service attacks intended to disrupt online banking services and other business activities, and •a higher volume and complexity of cyber attacks against the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions.JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches because:•the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched•cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally•JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and•it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as: •JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services•the acquisition and integration of new businesses, and•the increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems•misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators•disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems and those of its clients, customers and counterparties•the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions•violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures•dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers or counterparties•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.22JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:•potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers•increased operating expenses•higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity•regulatory intervention, or •weaker competitive standing.Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system.External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, payment systems and processors, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or other parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, whether authorized or unauthorized, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems•losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws, rules and regulations•increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach, and•reputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payments processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase's businesses and operations similarly rely on the workforces of third parties, including employees of vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures, and of businesses that it may seek to acquire. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:•the ineffective implementation of business decisions23Part I•any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls•staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets•the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics•a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or•other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses or operations depend.JPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in the processing and safeguarding of personal information.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. Governmental authorities around the world have adopted and are considering the adoption of numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives concerning privacy, data protection and security. Litigation or enforcement actions relating to these laws, rules and regulations could result in fines or orders requiring that JPMorgan Chase change its data-related practices, which could have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide products and otherwise harm its business operations.Implementing processes relating to JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:•increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs•hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and •require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Not all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or•intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties.Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers or employees, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the processing or safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from transferring information across national borders or sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal information when developing or offering products or services to customers. Some countries are considering or have adopted legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data which could increase the cost and complexity of JPMorgan Chase’s delivery of products and services. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.24JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including material instances of:•cyber attacks•security breaches of its physical premises, including threats to health and safety•power, telecommunications or internet outages, or shutdowns of mass transit•failure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems, including any resulting loss of critical data•damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase•effects of climate change•natural disasters or severe weather conditions•accidents such as explosions or structural failures•health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or•events arising from local or larger-scale civil or political unrest, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or terrorist acts.JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business disruption, including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and customers and third parties with which it does business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated. Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control, could:•hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event•cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries•disrupt market infrastructure systems on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely •expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm its reputation.Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:•potential harm to clients and customers, and any liability associated with that harm•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues•increased operational costs, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:25Part I•hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of Directors•lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase•require significant resources and time to remediate•lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations•attract heightened regulatory scrutiny•expose JPMorgan Chase to litigation, regulatory investigations or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and any liability associated with that harm•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate or untimely risk reporting.Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or judgments, including those used in its financial statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:•reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity•sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.JPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. Similarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires significant judgments, including forecasts of how macroeconomic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers to repay their loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. This is particularly true when the current and forecasted environments are significantly different from the historical environments upon which the models were developed, as JPMorgan Chase experienced during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased uncertainty may necessitate a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that JPMorgan Chase may make to model outputs than would otherwise be the case.Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing 26risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:•materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition•restrict its ability to access the capital markets •require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase. StrategicIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations. These strategies relate to:•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers•the geographies in which it operates•the types of clients and customers that it serves•the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests•the counterparties with which it does business, and •the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, are based on incomplete, inaccurate or fraudulent information, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:•devise effective business plans and strategies•offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers•allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment•allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations•conduct appropriate due diligence on prospective business acquisitions or investments, or effectively integrate newly-acquired businesses•appropriately address concerns of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, including with respect to ESG matters•react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs could be material to its results of operations in a given period.JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:•other banks and financial institutions•trading, advisory and investment management firms•finance companies27Part I•technology companies, and•other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar as well as new products and services.JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations. For example, aggressive or less disciplined lending practices by nonbank competitors could lead to a loss of market share for traditional banks, and in an economic downturn could result in instability in the financial services industry and adversely impact other market participants, including JPMorgan Chase.New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, lending and other extensions of credit to consumers, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications using secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies.Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.The effects of climate change could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, both directly and as a result of impacts on its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its business, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be adversely affected by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy. Both physical risks and transition risks associated with climate change could have negative impacts on the financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and on its exposure to those clients and customers.Climate-related physical risks include the increased frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as floods, wildfires and tropical storms, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as persistent changes in precipitation levels, rising sea levels, or increases in average ambient temperature.Potential adverse impacts of climate-related physical risks include:•declines in asset values, including due to the destruction or degradation of property•reduced availability or increased cost of insurance for clients of JPMorgan Chase•interruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and•population migration or unemployment in affected regions.Transition risks arise from societal adjustment to a lower-carbon economy, such as changes in public policy, adoption of new technologies or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. These risks could also be influenced by changes in the physical climate. Potential adverse impacts of transition risks include:  •sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)•increased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy  •increased energy costs driven by governmental actions and initiatives such as higher taxation and accelerated decarbonization policies•negative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences, and•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including due to any perception that its business practices are 28contrary to public policy or the preferences of different stakeholders. Climate risks can also arise from the inconsistencies and conflicts in the manner in which climate policy and financial regulation is implemented in the many regions where JPMorgan Chase operates, including initiatives to apply and enforce policy and regulation with extraterritorial effect.ConductConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s Code of Conduct and How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees have not occurred or will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants, employees or others. Some examples of this include:•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading•engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs•facilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers•violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants•using electronic communications channels that have not been approved by JPMorgan Chase•engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace•managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives, and•misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.The consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:•financial losses•increased operational and compliance costs•greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties•regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management•loss of clients or customers, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and practices.ReputationDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s 29Part Ibusiness and prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, including:•employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace•security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks•failure to safeguard client, customer or employee information•failure to manage risks associated with its business activities or those of its clients, including those that may be unpopular among one or more constituencies•failure to meet publicly-announced commitments to support ESG initiatives•non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations •operational failures•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions •actions taken in executing regulatory and governmental requirements during a global or regional health emergency, spread of infectious disease, epidemic or pandemic•regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and •failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or other parties, including newly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.Social and environmental activists have been increasingly targeting JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms with public criticism concerning their business practices, including business relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, such as companies :•whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or•whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities. Activists have also taken actions intended to change or influence JPMorgan Chase’s business practices with respect to ESG matters, including public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties, and submitting specific ESG-related proposals for a vote by JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders.These and other types of activist criticism and actions directed at JPMorgan Chase could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses ESG concerns in its business activities. In all of these cases, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could:•attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies•cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase •impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers•diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain employees•prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers•cause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan Chase, or•otherwise negatively affect JPMorgan Chase's business and results of operations.Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:•consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or•a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers.If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation, enforcement actions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:30•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related to, the same transaction•identify and address any conflict of interest that a third party with which it is does business may have with respect to a transaction involving JPMorgan Chase•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality•treat clients and customers fairly and with the appropriate standard of care•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or •handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately and in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations. A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.CountryAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally. Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:•worldwide economic disruption•heightened volatility in financial markets•severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments•substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region•disruption of global trade, and •diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and business activities are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including:•extreme currency fluctuations•high inflation•low or negative growth, and•defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as:•price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange•expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and•changes in laws, rules and regulations. The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including: •widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general strikes •crime and corruption31Part I•security and personal safety issues•an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, or other geopolitical instabilities•overthrow of incumbent governments•terrorist attacks, and •other forms of internal discord. These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.PeopleJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase’s increased use of hybrid work models could result in deterioration in employee performance or degradation of JPMorgan Chase's control environment which may have a material and adverse effect on its business and operations. Alternatively, discontinuing hybrid work models could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain employees.Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.LegalJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.32"

and the potential adverse effects of unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies on JPMorgan Chase’s workforce.•Legal risks relating to litigation and regulatory and government investigations.The above summary is subject in its entirety to the discussion of the risk factors set forth below.COVID-19 PandemicOngoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could harm the global economy and negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic, which included the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other countries, resulted in adverse impacts on global economic conditions, including:•significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets•significant disruption of global supply chains, and •closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment.  The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations, including:•reduction in demand for certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting in lower revenue, and•increases in the allowance for credit losses during the early stages of the pandemic.Although global economic conditions have been improving despite the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic, any ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, including as a result of additional waves or variants of the COVID-19 disease or the emergence of other diseases that have similar outcomes, could have significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including:•recognition of charge-offs and increases in the allowance for credit losses, including any delayed recognition of charge-offs due to the impact of government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers•material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets•downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings•constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) related to supporting client activities, downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors, any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity and capital management strategies, and•the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be fully predicted, including:•the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic •the effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines, and their availability in certain regions•actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, and•the effect that the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of the pandemic may have on the pace of economic growth, inflation, the strength of labor markets, particularly in light of the expiration of government assistance programs, and the potential for changes in consumer 10behavior that could have longer-term impacts on certain economic sectors.In addition, JPMorgan Chase's participation in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, whether directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities, newly-acquired businesses or companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to:•increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny•negative publicity, and •increased exposure to litigation, any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below. RegulatoryJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. Regulation of the financial services industry is extensive.The regulation and supervision of financial services firms has expanded significantly over an extended period of time. The increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations. JPMorgan Chase could be required to make further changes to its business and operations in response to expanded supervision or to new or changed laws, rules and regulations. These types of developments could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs in connection with complying with applicable laws, rules and regulations, which could reduce its profitability. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase’s entry into or acquisition of a new business or an increase in its principal investments may require JPMorgan Chase to comply with additional laws, rules, and regulations.In response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be, required to:•limit the products and services that it offers•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities•refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue•pay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations•incur losses with respect to fraudulent transactions perpetrated against its customers•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.In particular, JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws, rules and regulations, or changes in the application, interpretation or enforcement of laws, rules and regulations, that:•proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain financial services activities•impose new requirements relating to the impact of business activities on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) concerns, the management of risks associated with those concerns and the offering of products intended to achieve ESG-related objectives, or•introduce changes to antitrust or anti-competition laws, rules and regulations that adversely affect the business activities of JPMorgan Chase. Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.The content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:•larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation•financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or •the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.These types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.11Part IThere can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:•the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries•requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries•the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities•the resolution of financial institutions•requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives•governance and accountability regimes•conduct of business and control requirements, and•restrictions on compensation.These types of differences, inconsistencies and conflicts in financial services regulation have required and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:•divest assets or restructure its operations•absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs •change the prices that it charges for its products and services •curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients•curtail other business opportunities, including acquisitions or principal investments, that it otherwise would have pursued, or •incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.Resolving regulatory investigations can subject JPMorgan Chase to significant penalties and collateral consequences, and could result in higher compliance costs or restrictions on its operations.JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs, including devoting substantial resources to the required remediation, or needing to comply with other restrictions. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:•greater exposure in litigation•damage to reputation•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or•other direct and indirect adverse effects.Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:•loss of clients, customers and business•restrictions on offering certain products or services, and •losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.JPMorgan Chase expects that: •it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions•regulators will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions; and  12•regulators will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions.If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards and expectations of its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:•enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions•pay additional regulatory penalties or enter into judgments, or•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.JPMorgan Chase can face greater risks of non-compliance and incur higher operational and compliance costs under laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-money laundering, economic sanctions, embargo programs and anti-corruption.JPMorgan Chase must comply with laws, rules and regulations throughout the world relating to anti-money laundering, economic sanctions, embargo programs and anti-corruption which can increase its risks of non-compliance and costs associated with the implementation and maintenance of complex compliance programs. A violation of any of these legal and regulatory requirements could subject JPMorgan Chase, or individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties. In addition, certain national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S. have adopted laws, rules or regulations that conflict with or prohibit a firm such as JPMorgan Chase from complying with laws, rules and regulations to which it is otherwise subject, creating conflict of law issues that also increase its risks of non-compliance in those jurisdictions.JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.JPMorgan Chase conducts existing and new business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions•conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual property or other obligations•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and •the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in a particular country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For example, conducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems.Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its businesses.JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. The agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in 13Part Iways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy. Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either: •in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  •in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.   Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.  PoliticalEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Political developments in the U.S. and other countries can cause uncertainty in the economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could significantly affect U.S. and global economic growth and cause higher volatility in the financial markets, including:•monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions•fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation and spending•actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken•isolationist foreign policies•an outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other geopolitical instabilities•economic sanctions•the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or•other governmental policies or actions adopted or taken in response to political or social pressures.These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency •provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations •lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. GSEs”)•increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time•result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries 14•increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, or influence investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole•adversely affect the financial condition or credit ratings of clients and counterparties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, or•cause JPMorgan Chase to refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue.These factors could lead to:•slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession•greater market volatility•a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads •erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets •diminished investor and consumer confidence•lower investment growth•large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries•reduced commercial activity among trading partners•the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country•the possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty•potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or •other market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, increase credit risk, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.MarketEconomic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and investment and market-making positions.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:•investor, consumer and business sentiment•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets•inflation or deflation•high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market•the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit•levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility•the economic effects of an outbreak or escalation of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics or other extraordinary events beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control, and•the health of the U.S. and global economies.All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:•severe declines in asset values•unexpected credit events•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)•the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-making and investment portfolio positions, or•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions and governmental policies.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:•personal and household income distribution•unemployment or underemployment•prolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates•housing prices•the level of inflation and its effect on prices for goods and services•consumer and small business confidence levels, and•changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt.15Part IHeightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where declining industrial or manufacturing activity has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:•policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration, employment status and housing, and•policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.In addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers. Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses.In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or•dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, or sustained changes in consumer behavior that affect specific economic sectors, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments or economic sectors, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.An economic downturn or sustained changes in consumer behavior that results in shifts in consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Sustained adverse economic conditions could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing increases in the allowance for credit losses, higher delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses.16Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and income streams related to its traditional banking and funding activities. In general, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:•net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments•unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy•JPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount of deposits that it accepts from customers and clients, which could result in lower revenues, and•a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. When interest rates are increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:•fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans•losses on underwriting exposures•the loss of deposits, including in the event that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior•unrealized mark-to-market losses on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities held in the investment securities portfolio•lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings•less liquidity in the financial markets, and•higher funding costs.All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s earnings or its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments that JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and control JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.CreditJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, securities exchanges and government entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations.A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby 17Part Iincreasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. In addition, JPMorgan Chase can be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase can be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.Transactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant.JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when:•JPMorgan Chase fails to realize the fair value of the collateral it holds•collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or•counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons.Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:•engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries•do business in the same geographic region, or•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to increase the allowance for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of 18JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of RWA that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.LiquidityJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained. JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:•market-wide illiquidity or disruption•unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations•inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices•default by a CCP or other significant market participant•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral•unexpected loss of consumer deposits or higher than anticipated draws on lending-related commitments, and•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements•address obligations under its resolution plan, or•satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn generally holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and provides intercompany lending to the holding company. The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to regulatory restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and borrowings from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to:•pay interest on its debt securities19Part I•pay dividends on its equity securities•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and•fulfill its other payment obligations.These arrangements could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws or otherwise entering into resolution proceedings at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:•expected future profitability •risk management practices•legal expenses•ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries•regulatory developments •assumptions about government support, and •economic and geopolitical developments. JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:•reducing its access to capital markets •materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities •triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and •decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.The reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect financial instruments issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase and expose it to litigation and other disputes. Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,” including those in widespread and longstanding use, have been the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives for reform, including:•changes to the rules and methodologies under which certain benchmarks are administered•initiatives designed to discourage or prohibit the use of certain benchmarks by market participants•the introduction of alternative reference rates to be used by market participants in lieu of certain benchmarks, and•legislative proposals and actions providing for the replacement of reference rates under existing contracts and instruments that are linked to certain benchmarks with alternative reference rates.Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These and other reforms relating to benchmarks could: •cause certain benchmarks to be substantially modified or to be permanently discontinued •lead to disruptions in the financial markets, including in connection with the transition to alternative reference rates•give rise to litigation and other disputes•cause reputational harm to the extent that operational and technology systems are not sufficiently prepared for the transition to alternative reference rates, or •have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated.Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.Changes in the manner in which certain benchmarks are administered, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of those benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of those benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to those benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger further changes in the rules or methodologies under which certain benchmarks are 20administered or lead to the discontinuation of certain benchmarks.Regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries continue to engage in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative reference rates to replace certain benchmarks, and certain of these alternative rates have gained or are gaining acceptance among market participants. However, there is no assurance that: •any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace•arrangements by market participants to prepare for the discontinuation of certain benchmarks and the transition to alternative reference rates will be fully effective, or•a particular alternative reference rate will be widely accepted by market participants, or that market acceptance of that rate will not be hindered by the introduction of other reference rates. If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative reference rate has not been successfully introduced or widely accepted within the market, this could result in significant adverse effects on the financial markets. For example, vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) benchmark. ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, has announced that the publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will cease after June 30, 2023, and significant progress has been made by regulators, industry bodies and market participants to introduce and implement the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as a replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. However, if an alternative reference rate such as SOFR has not achieved sufficient market acceptance when the publication of the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR is discontinued, or if market participants have not otherwise implemented effective transitional arrangements to address that discontinuation, this could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets, volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and the suppression of capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on U.S. dollar LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from U.S. dollar LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has: •treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments•failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers,   or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest•made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates•engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or•disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments.These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.CapitalMaintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements. In addition, as a Globally Systemically Important Bank (“GSIB”), JPMorgan Chase is required to hold additional capital buffers, including a GSIB surcharge, a SCB, and a countercyclical buffer, each of which is reassessed at least annually. The amount of capital that JPMorgan Chase is required to hold in order to satisfy these leverage-and risk-based requirements could increase at any given time due to factors such as:•actions by banking regulators, including changes in laws, rules, and regulations•actions taken by the Federal Reserve or the U.S. government in response to the economic effects of systemic events, such as the actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which led to an expansion of the Federal Reserve balance sheet, growth in deposits held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial institutions and, consequently, an increase in leverage exposure and the GSIB surcharge•changes in the composition of JPMorgan Chase’s balance sheet or developments that could increase risk weighted assets such as increased market risk, customer delinquencies, client credit rating downgrades or other factors, and21Part I•increases in estimated stress losses as determined by the Federal Reserve under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s SCB.Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in applicable capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, such as:•reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase•requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management strategy•constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or•curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or operations.OperationalJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on:•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and•the ability of JPMorgan Chase to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies (including those that provide cloud computing services). The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•delays or other disruptions in providing services, liquidity or information to clients and customers•the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required•failure to timely settle or confirm transactions•the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences•financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable•client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase’s products and services•regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against JPMorgan Chase•loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:•attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers may increase, evolve or become more complex, particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty•errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues•failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and•third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of newly-acquired businesses or of external parties on which 22JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous attempted cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to as “malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These attacks are often designed to:•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•manipulate data•destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems•steal money, or•extort money through the use of so-called “ransomware.”JPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services.JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:•the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched•cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally•JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and•it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as: •JPMorgan Chase’s ongoing expansion of its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications, including those that use cloud computing services•the acquisition of new businesses, and•the increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems•misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators•disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems  and those of its clients, customers and counterparties•the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions•violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,  customers, counterparties or employees•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures•dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers or counterparties•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.23Part IThe extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), acquires or invests in a business or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:•potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers•increased operating expenses•higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity•regulatory intervention, or •weaker competitive standing.Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system.External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services, and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems•losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws, rules and regulations•increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach, and•reputational harm arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, clearing banks, CCPs, payment processors, financial technology companies, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that the disruption of an operational system involving one institution or entity, including due to a cyber attack, may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.24JPMorgan Chase’s operations rely on its ability, and the ability of key external parties, to maintain appropriately-staffed workforces, and on the competence, trustworthiness, health and safety of employees.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on its ability to staff its operations appropriately and on the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees. JPMorgan Chase is similarly dependent on the workforces of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:•the ineffective implementation of business decisions•any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls•staffing shortages, particularly in tight labor markets•a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or•other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations depend.JPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include:•JPMorgan Chase’s current, prospective and former clients and customers•clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers•current, prospective and former employees, and•employees of JPMorgan Chase’s vendors, counterparties and other external parties.Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:•increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs•hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and •require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Not all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or•intercepted or otherwise compromised by unauthorized third parties.Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.In recent years, well-publicized incidents involving the  inappropriate collection, use, sharing or storage of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, sharing and storage of personal information. These types of laws, rules and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s 25Part Idevelopment or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by occurrences of extraordinary events beyond its control.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including material instances of:•cyber attacks•security breaches of its physical premises, including threats to health and safety•power, telecommunications or internet outages, or shutdowns of mass transit•failure of, or loss of access to, technology or operational systems, including any resulting loss of critical data•damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase•effects of climate change•natural disasters or severe weather conditions•accidents such as explosions or structural failures•health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, or•events arising from local or larger-scale civil unrest, any outbreak or escalation of hostilities or terrorist acts.JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business disruption, including due to the occurrence of an extraordinary event beyond its control. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase, its clients, and customers and third parties with which it does business, or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple business disruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business disruption event could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if such an event were to occur in an area in which they are concentrated. Further, should extraordinary events or the factors that cause or contribute to those events become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or the occurrence of one or more extraordinary events that are beyond its control, could:•hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption or to address the event•cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries•disrupt market infrastructure systems on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely •expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm its reputation.Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:•potential harm to clients and customers, and any liability associated with that harm•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues•increased operational costs, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:26•hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and Board of Directors•lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase•require significant resources and time to remediate•lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations•attract heightened regulatory scrutiny•expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings•subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•lead to potential harm to customers and clients, and any liability associated with that harm•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior and to some degree are based on management’s subjective judgment or assumptions. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may become uncorrelated at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or judgments, including those used in its financial statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models and estimations as a basis for its stress testing and in connection with the preparation of its financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:•reliance on historical trends that may not persist in the future, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations such as correlations among certain market indicators or asset prices•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not be indicative of severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity•sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.JPMorgan Chase may experience unexpected losses if models, estimates or judgments used or applied in connection with its risk management activities or the preparation of its financial statements prove to have been inadequate or incorrect. For example, where quoted market prices are not available for certain financial instruments that require a determination of their fair value, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. Similarly, JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses related to its credit exposures which requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. These types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. In addition, certain models used by JPMorgan Chase as a basis for the determination of the allowance for expected credit losses experienced heightened performance risk in the economic environment during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. These models are based on historical experience of internally-developed macroeconomic scenarios, and when the current and forecasted environment is significantly different from the scenarios 27Part Iunderlying those models, JPMorgan Chase may need to apply a greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform any adjustments that it has made or may make to model outputs.Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations for calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could result in inaccurate financial reporting which, in turn, could:•materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition•restrict its ability to access the capital markets •require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase. StrategicIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations. These strategies relate to:•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers•the geographies in which it operates•the types of clients and customers that it serves•the businesses that it acquires or in which it invests•the counterparties with which it does business, and •the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:•devise effective business plans and strategies•offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers•allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment•allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations•appropriately address concerns of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, including with respect to social and sustainability matters•react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs could be material to its results of operations in a given period.JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:•other banks and financial institutions•trading, advisory and investment management firms28•finance companies•technology companies, and•other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services.JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities and cryptocurrency trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other products and services, including deposits and other traditional banking products, could be significantly disrupted by the use of new technologies, such as cryptocurrencies and other applications that use secure distributed ledgers, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those technologies.Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.The effects of climate change could adversely impact JPMorgan Chase and its clients. JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its businesses, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be impacted by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, including changes in climate policy or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to risks posed by climate change.Climate-related physical risks include acute weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, and chronic shifts in the climate, such as altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires, rising sea levels, or a rising heat index. Climate-related physical risks could have adverse financial and other impacts on JPMorgan Chase, both directly on its business and operations and as a result of impacts to its clients and customers, including:•declines in asset values, including due to the destruction or degradation of property•reduced availability of insurance•significant interruptions to business operations, including supply chain disruption, and•systemic changes to geographies, regional economies and sectors, and any resulting population migration or unemployment.Transition risks arise from the process of adjusting to a low-carbon economy. In addition to possible changes in climate policy and financial regulation, potential transition risks may include economic and other changes engendered by the development of low-carbon technological advances (e.g., electric vehicles and renewable energy) and/or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. Transition risks could be further accelerated by the occurrence of changes in the physical climate. The possible adverse impacts of transition risks to both JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers include: •sudden devaluation of assets, including unanticipated write-downs (“stranded assets”)•increased operational and compliance costs driven by changes in climate policy and/or regulations •negative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences, and•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation, including as a result of any perception that its business practices are contrary to public policy or stakeholder preferences.Both physical risks and transition risks could have negative impacts on the revenues, financial condition or creditworthiness of JPMorgan’s clients and customers, and on its exposure to those clients and customers.29Part IConductConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s Code of Conduct and How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have engaged in improper or illegal conduct in the past. These instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation, and resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include:•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading•engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs•facilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers•violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants•using electronic communications channels that have not been approved by JPMorgan Chase•engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace•managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives, and•misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.The consequences of any failure by one or more employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:•financial losses•increased operational and compliance costs•greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties•regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management•loss of clients or customers, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The foregoing risks could be heightened with respect to newly-acquired businesses if JPMorgan Chase fails to successfully integrate employees of those businesses or any of those employees do not conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase's expectations, policies and practices.ReputationDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, including:•employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace30•security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks•failure to safeguard client, customer or employee information•failure to manage risks associated with its business activities or those of its clients, including those that may be unpopular among one or more constituencies•failure to fully discharge publicly-announced commitments to support social and sustainability initiatives•non-compliance with laws, rules, and regulations •operational failures•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions •actions taken in executing regulatory and governmental requirements during a global or regional health emergency•regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and •failure or perceived failure to comply with laws, rules or regulations by JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or other parties, including newly-acquired businesses, companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.Social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities. Activists have also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses social and sustainability concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could: •cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase •impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers•diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain employees•prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers.•cause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan Chase, or•attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies.Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:•consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or•a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customersIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest or to satisfy fiduciary obligations can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related to, the same transaction•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality•treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations31Part I•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or •handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations. A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.CountryAn outbreak or escalation of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally. Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:•worldwide economic disruption•heightened volatility in financial markets•severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments•substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region•disruption of global trade, and •diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and business activity are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including:•extreme currency fluctuations•high inflation•low or negative growth, and•defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, such as:•price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange•expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and•changes in laws, rules and regulations. The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including: •widespread demonstrations, civil unrest or general strikes •crime and corruption•security and personal safety issues•an outbreak or escalation of hostilities•overthrow of incumbent governments•terrorist attacks, and •other forms of internal discord. These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.32PeopleJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. JPMorgan Chase's efforts to retain talented and diverse employees can be particularly challenging when members of its workforce are targeted for recruitment by competitors. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Operating Committee and other senior leaders, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.LegalJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.33Parts I and II"

. The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.SummaryThe principal risks that could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation include:•Risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the significant harm that the pandemic has caused and is causing to the global economy and the further negative effects that it could have on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.•Regulatory risks, including the impact that applicable laws, rules and regulations in the highly-regulated financial services industry, as well as changes to or in the interpretation of those laws, rules and regulations, can have on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations; the ways in which differences in financial services regulation in different jurisdictions or with respect to certain competitors can disadvantage JPMorgan Chase’s business; the higher compliance costs and potential for operational restrictions due to heightened regulatory scrutiny; risks associated with complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws; the ways in which less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks in certain countries can negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results;

and the potential for credit losses due to declines in the value of collateral in stressed market conditions or from concentrations of credit and market risk.•Liquidity risks, including the risk that JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired by market-wide illiquidity or disruption, unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, the inability to sell assets, default by a significant market participant, unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, or lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase; the dependence of JPMorgan Chase & Co. on the cash flows of its subsidiaries; the adverse effects that any downgrade in any of JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may have on its liquidity and cost of funding; and potential negative impacts on JPMorgan Chase’s funding, investments and financial products, as well as litigation risks, associated with the transition from LIBOR and other benchmark rates.•Capital risks, including the risk that any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in the capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to distribute capital to shareholders or to support its business activities.•Operational risks, including risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s dependence on its operational systems and the competence, integrity, health and safety of its employees, as well as the systems and employees of external parties; the potential negative effects of failing to identify and address operational risks related to the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms; risks from JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to external operational systems; legal and operational risks related to safeguarding personal information; the harm that could be caused by a successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase or by catastrophes or other events; risks associated with JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, its models and estimations and associated judgments used in its financial statements, and controls over disclosure and financial reporting or from changes in accounting standards or policies; and potential adverse effects of failing to comply with heightened regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers.•Strategic risks, including the damage to JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results that could occur if management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies; risks associated with the significant and increasing competition that JPMorgan Chase faces; and the potential adverse impacts of climate change on JPMorgan Chase’s business operations, clients and customers.8•Conduct risks, including the negative impact that can result from the failure of employees to conduct themselves in accordance with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices.•Reputation risks, including the potential adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with its clients, customers, shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders that could arise from employee misconduct, security breaches, inadequate risk management, compliance or operational failures, litigation and regulatory investigations, failure to satisfy expectations concerning social and environmental concerns or other factors that could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.•Country risks, including potential impacts on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses from an outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region; and the potential adverse effects of local economic, political, regulatory and social factors on JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in certain countries.•People risks, including the criticality of attracting and retaining qualified and diverse employees; and the potential adverse effects of unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies on JPMorgan Chase’s workforce.•Legal risks relating to litigation and regulatory and government investigations.The above summary is subject in its entirety to the more complete inventory and discussion of the risks facing JPMorgan Chase set forth below.COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is causing significant harm to the global economy and could further negatively affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the pandemic led to the institution of social distancing and shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other countries resulting in ongoing severe impacts on global economic conditions, including:•significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets •significant disruption of global supply chains, and •closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment.  A prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the emergence of other diseases that give rise to similar effects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global economy. The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations, including:•reduction in demand for certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting in lower revenue, and•increases in the allowance for credit losses.Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. There can be no assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these developments. A prolongation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic and the negative economic impacts of the pandemic could have other significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, including:•recognition of credit losses and further increases in the allowance for credit losses, especially to the extent that businesses remain closed, unemployment continues at elevated levels, clients and customers draw on their lines of credit or significant numbers of people relocate from metropolitan areas•material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets•downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings•constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) related to supporting client activities, downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory actions or other factors, any or all of which could require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity and capital management strategies, and•the possibility that significant portions of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic.The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccination programs and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic. Those negative effects, including the possible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed 9Part Ibecause of the impact of prior and potential future government stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to clients and customers. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and clients or by affiliated entities, in U.S. government programs designed to support individuals, households and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to:•increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny•negative publicity, and •increased exposure to litigation, any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below. RegulatoryJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and  existing, new or changed laws, rules and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. Regulation of the financial services industry is extensive.The regulation and supervision of financial services firms has expanded significantly over an extended period of time. The increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations. JPMorgan Chase could be required to make further changes to its business and operations in response to expanded supervision, new laws, rules and regulations, and changes to existing laws, rules and regulations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations and could reduce its profitability. In response to new and existing laws, rules and regulations and expanded supervision, JPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the future be, required to:•limit the products and services that it offers•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities•refrain from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue•pay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.In particular, JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in laws, rules and regulations, or changes in the application, interpretation or enforcement of laws, rules and regulations, that:•proscribe or institute more stringent restrictions on certain financial services activities, or•introduce changes to antitrust or anti-competition laws, rules and regulations that adversely affect the business activities of JPMorgan Chase. Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s business.The content and application of laws, rules and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:•larger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation•financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or •the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.These differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant 10countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws, rules and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:•the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries•requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries•the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities•the resolution of financial institutions•requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives•governance and accountability regimes•conduct of business and control requirements, and•restrictions on compensation.These types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws, rules and regulations between different jurisdictions, have required and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:•divest assets or restructure its operations•absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs •change the prices that it charges for its products and services •curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or •incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws, rules and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could result in higher compliance costs and restrictions on its operations.JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:•greater exposure in litigation•damage to reputation•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or•other direct and indirect adverse effects.Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have required that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:•loss of clients, customers and business•restrictions on offering certain products or services, and •losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.JPMorgan Chase expects that: •it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions•regulators will continue to require that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions; and  •regulators will be more likely to pursue formal enforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan Chase to the extent that it has previously been subject to other governmental investigations or enforcement actions.If JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators, it could be required to:•enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions•pay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.11Part IIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.Complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks.JPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations throughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements. Certain governments have enacted laws, which are commonly referred to as “blocking laws,” that are designed to prohibit compliance with some U.S. sanctions and may raise significant conflict of laws issues. A violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations, or enforcement of blocking laws, could subject JPMorgan Chase, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.JPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can be negatively impacted in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.JPMorgan Chase conducts business in certain countries in which the application of the rule of law is inconsistent or less predictable, including with respect to:•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions•conflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual property or other obligations•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and •the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.If the application of the laws, rules and regulations in a particular country is susceptible to producing inconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a more difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its business and could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings with respect to that country. For example, conducting business could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws, rules and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws, rules and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems.Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses and could increase its funding or operational costs or curtail its business.JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. The agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy. Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either: •in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  •in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  12If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.   Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.  Regulatory uncertainties associated with the U.K.’s departure from the EU could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations and operating model.The U.K.’s departure from the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,” was completed on December 31, 2020. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement entered into between the U.K. and the EU in December 2020 included very limited provisions relating to the conduct of financial services activities between the U.K. and the EU. Accordingly, unless or until the U.K. and the EU enter into further agreements relating to financial services, the regulatory environment for financial services in the aftermath of Brexit can be expected to:•significantly limit the ability of U.K.-based financial services firms to conduct business in the EU, and vice versa•prolong uncertainty concerning the levels of market access for trading venues, which could result in a reduction or fragmentation of market liquidity, and•prolong ongoing uncertainties concerning optimal business models for firms providing financial services, especially given that any changes in the regulation of such services by the U.K. may not benefit from equivalence determinations by the EU.As a result of these limitations and uncertainties, JPMorgan Chase:•has made and is continuing to make appropriate changes to its legal entity structure and operations in the U.K. and the EU to address the regulatory environment•is now maintaining, and expects that it will be required to sustain, a more fragmented operating model across its U.K. and EU operating entities, and•expects that, due to considerations such as operating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital, this modified European operating framework will be more complex, less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and EU and U.K. government responses to the pandemic, including travel restrictions and lock-downs, have introduced delays and uncertainties into JPMorgan Chase’s implementation of its plans for maintaining continuity of service for its clients.Any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the financial services market across the U.K. and the EU as well as JPMorgan Chase’s business, operations and earnings in the U.K., the EU and globally.PoliticalEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the U.S. and other countries. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets, including:•monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any sustained large-scale asset purchases or any suspension or reversal of those actions•fiscal policies, including with respect to taxation13Part I•actions that governments take or fail to take in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of any actions taken•isolationist foreign policies•the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or•political and social pressures with respect to governmental policies and actions.These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency •provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations •lead to the withdrawal of government support for agencies and enterprises such as the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association and the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. GSEs”)•increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time•result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries, and •increase investor reliance on actions by the Federal Reserve or other central banks, or investor perceptions concerning government support of sectors of the economy or the economy as a whole.These factors could lead to:•slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession•greater market volatility•a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads •erosion of adequate risk premium on certain financial assets •diminished investor and consumer confidence•lower investment growth•large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries•reduced commercial activity among trading partners•the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country•the possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty•potential expropriation or nationalization of assets, or •other market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.MarketEconomic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and investment and market-making positions.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:•investor, consumer and business sentiment•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets•inflation or deflation•high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market•the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit•levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility•the economic effects of outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyber attacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, and•the health of the U.S. and global economies.All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:•severe declines in asset values•unexpected credit events•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)•the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-making and investment portfolio positions, or•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.14If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:•personal and household income distribution•unemployment or underemployment•prolonged periods of exceptionally low interest rates•housing prices•consumer and small business confidence levels•changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt, and •the number of personal bankruptcies.Heightened levels of unemployment or underemployment that result in reduced personal and household income could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies, additions to the allowance for credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies and industry segments where economic restrictions and shutdowns have occurred related to the COVID-19 pandemic, declining industrial or manufacturing activity that has resulted in or could result in higher levels of unemployment, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, could impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:•policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration, employment status and housing, and•policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as higher taxes and increased regulation which could result in reductions in consumer disposable income.In addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers. Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses.In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or•dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.15Part IAn economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Severe and sustained adverse economic conditions, including higher unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic, could result in reductions in the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from their tenants which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing higher delinquencies, defaults and write-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses.Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and income streams related to the Firm’s traditional banking and funding activities. In general, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:•net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments•unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy•JPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount of deposits that it accepts from customers and clients, which could result in lower revenues, and•a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. When interest rates are increasing, JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:•fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans•losses on underwriting exposures•the loss of deposits, including in the event that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior•lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings•less liquidity in the financial markets, and•higher funding costs.All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s financial instruments which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and control JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase’s hedging and other risk management strategies may not be effective, and it could incur significant losses, if extreme market events were to occur.16CreditJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse changes in the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties such as corporations, financial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds, exchanges and government entities within and outside the U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, including under the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.Transactions with government entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks. Government entities may, among other things, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government. These types of actions have in the past caused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct business in the relevant jurisdiction.In addition, local laws, rules and regulations could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and litigation in the event of a counterparty default or unwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments, which could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting, and JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant.JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when:•JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral it holds•collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or•counterparties are unable to post collateral, whether for operational or other reasons.Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:•engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries•do business in the same geographic region, or•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. 17Part IFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses and investment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may be required to recognize higher allowances for credit losses with respect to certain clients or industries in order to align with directives or expectations of its banking regulators. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of RWA that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.LiquidityJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses could be impaired if its liquidity is constrained. JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:•market-wide illiquidity or disruption•unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations•inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices•default by a CCP or other significant market participant•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral•unexpected loss of consumer deposits, and•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements•address obligations under its resolution plan, or•satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries (including, in particular, its broker-dealer subsidiaries), and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company. The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions 18on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity thresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to:•pay interest on its debt securities•pay dividends on its equity securities•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and•fulfill its other payment obligations.These regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:•expected future profitability •risk management practices•legal expenses•ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries•regulatory developments •assumptions about government support, and •economic and geopolitical trends. JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:•reducing its access to capital markets •materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities •triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and •decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.The reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s funding, investments and financial products, and expose it to litigation and other disputes.Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,” including those in widespread and longstanding use, have been the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These reforms may cause certain benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated. Any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks.Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.Various regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks. There is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants, or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace. If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark, this could result in widespread 19Part Idislocation in the financial markets, engender volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations. To the extent that any guidance provided by accounting standard setters concerning the transition from benchmark rates is not comprehensive, fails to provide the expected relief or the ability to elect or implement that guidance is constrained in any significant respect, the transition could:•affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to a particular benchmark and any related derivatives, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations, or•increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs with respect to the determination of whether the transition has resulted in the modification or extinguishment of specific contracts for accounting purposes.ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, has announced that it will consult on its intention to:•cease publication of (i) all tenors of the euro, sterling, Swiss franc and yen LIBORs and (ii) the one week and two month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, in each case, after December 31, 2021, and•cease publication of all remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR after June 30, 2023.These announcements indicate that it is highly likely that various tenors of the LIBOR benchmark will be discontinued on or about the timeframes mentioned above. Vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the LIBOR benchmark, and any inability of market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption in the financial markets and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has: •treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments•failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers,   or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest•made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates•engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or•disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments.These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.CapitalMaintaining the required level and composition of capital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support business activities, meet evolving regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, including leverage- and risk-based capital requirements, that can change due to actions by banking regulators. JPMorgan Chase’s adherence to these requirements can also evolve dynamically in response to changes in the composition of its balance sheet or other factors. It is possible that these changing requirements, including meeting or exceeding various capital ratio thresholds, could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support its businesses and make capital distributions to its shareholders.Actions by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to an expansion of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, growth in deposit balances held by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial institutions and, consequently, an increase in JPMorgan Chase's leverage exposure. If these trends were to continue, JPMorgan Chase may be required to hold more capital or take other actions in order to satisfy the leverage-based capital requirements applicable to it.JPMorgan Chase is required to submit, at least annually, a capital plan describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders, redemptions and repurchases of its outstanding securities and other capital actions that it intends to take. JPMorgan Chase considers various factors in managing capital, including the impact of stress on its capital levels, as determined by both internal modeling and the Federal Reserve’s modeling of JPMorgan Chase’s capital position in supervisory stress tests. Because the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase use different forecasting models and methodologies when determining stress test results, there can be significant differences between the estimates of stress loss as determined by the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase, respectively. The Federal 20Reserve may require modifications to JPMorgan Chase’s capital plan, and may change the Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”) applicable to JPMorgan Chase, from time to time. Any failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to maintain the required level and composition of capital, or unfavorable changes in the capital requirements imposed by banking regulators, could have an adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, such as:•reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase•requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management strategy•constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock, or•curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or operations.OperationalJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on:•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and•JPMorgan Chase’s ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies. The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•delays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers•the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required•failure to timely settle or confirm transactions•the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with unintended consequences•financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable•client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase’s products and services•regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions against JPMorgan Chase•loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase, it can become more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:•attempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers may increase, evolve or become more complex, particularly during periods of market disruption or economic uncertainty•errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues•failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and•third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the requirements of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations or bank regulatory 21Part Istandards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.A successful cyber attack affecting JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous attempted cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which is commonly referred to as “malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These attacks are typically designed to:•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•manipulate data•destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems•steal money, or•extort money through the use of so-called “ransomware.”JPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services.JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:•the techniques used in cyber attacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched•cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally•JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and•it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications. Furthermore, increased use of remote access and third party video conferencing solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to facilitate work-from-home arrangements for employees, could increase JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to cyber attacks. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems•misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators•disruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems  and those of its clients, customers and counterparties•the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions•violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,  customers, counterparties or employees•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures•dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers or counterparties•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may 22continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:•potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers•increased operating expenses•higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity•regulatory intervention, or •weaker competitive standing.Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer satisfaction could be adversely affected by the failure of an external operational system.External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown or cyber attack involving another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems•losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws, rules and regulations•increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach, and•harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties continues to expand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure or cyber attacks with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure or cyber attack involving one institution or entity may cause industry-wide operational disruptions that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.JPMorgan Chase’s operations could be impaired if its employees, or those of external parties, are not competent and trustworthy, or if measures to protect their health and safety are ineffective.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on the competence and integrity of its employees, as well as employees of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan 23Part IChase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:•the ineffective implementation of business decisions•any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls•a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or•other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations depend.JPMorgan Chase’s operations could also be impaired if the measures taken by it or by governmental authorities to help ensure the health and safety of its employees are ineffective, or if any external party on which JPMorgan Chase relies fails to take appropriate and effective actions to protect the health and safety of its employees.JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws, rules and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include:•JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, and prospective clients and customers•clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers•employees and prospective employees, and•employees of JPMorgan Chase’s vendors, counterparties and other external parties.Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:•increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs•hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and •require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Not all of JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties may have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or•intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties.Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, rules and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.In recent years, well-publicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws, rules and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information. These types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including:•cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises, including data centers•power, telecommunications or internet outages•failures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets24•damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase•effects of climate change•natural disasters or severe weather conditions•accidents such as explosions or structural failures•health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, or•events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a Firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers or that its resiliency plans will be adequate to address the effects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple catastrophes or other business interruption events. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if a catastrophic event occurs in an area in which a critical segment of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure is concentrated. Further, should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions or health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or any catastrophic event, could:•hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption•cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm its reputation.Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase may incur costs in connection with disposing of certain excess properties, premises and facilities, and those costs may be material to its results of operations in a given period. Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:•potential liability to clients and customers•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues•increased operational costs, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Any such inadequacy or lapse could:•hinder the timely escalation of material risk issues to JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and the Board of Directors•lead to business decisions that have negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase•require significant resources and time to remediate•lead to non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations•attract heightened regulatory scrutiny•expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings•subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of 25Part IJPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior.  These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated. Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.JPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations or judgments, including those used in its financial statements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, capital, liquidity, operational and other risks. These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:•reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan Chase also uses internal models in connection with its stress testing. JPMorgan Chase’s capital actions may require regulatory approval and could be constrained if its banking regulators object to a capital plan or require the resubmission of a capital plan due to the perceived inadequacy of JPMorgan Chase’s models, estimations or other factors.Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining the allowance for credit losses, reserves related to litigation and the credit card rewards liability. Certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements, including:•trading assets and liabilities•instruments in the investment portfolio•certain loans•MSRs•structured notes, and •certain repurchase and resale agreements.Where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment, and these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments, which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates or judgments underlying JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan Chase may experience material losses.JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures. It then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the amounts of capital and liquidity that would be needed in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. It is possible that 26JPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have heightened performance risk in the economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. For example, at times certain macroeconomic variables employed in these models remained well outside the range of historical data used to train the models for some stress scenarios. In addition, the historical relationships between these macroeconomic variables and consumer and wholesale credit losses have deteriorated, in part due to the effects of the CARES Act and government stimulus actions. As a result, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the reliability of the projections produced by the models. To compensate for this uncertainty, JPMorgan Chase has made, and may continue to make, significant adjustments to the quantitative results of model calculations to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risks, trends and other factors that are not yet reflected in those calculations. There can be no assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these developments. Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could:•materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition•restrict its ability to access the capital markets •require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies.The preparation of JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as more detailed accounting policies established by JPMorgan Chase’s management. From time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change, and in some cases these changes could have a significant effect on JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results. As of January 1, 2020, JPMorgan Chase implemented a new accounting standard, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) framework, which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments. The allowance for credit losses related to certain of JPMorgan Chase’s loans and other lending-related commitments portfolios increased upon implementation of CECL, which has had a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s capital levels.The ongoing impact of the adoption of CECL could include the following, each of which could result in diminished investor confidence:•greater volatility in JPMorgan Chase’s earnings and capital levels over economic cycles•potential reductions in its capital distributions, or•increases in the allowance for credit losses.In addition, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates, including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products, particularly during periods of economic stress, as well as changes related to non-U.S. financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this accounting standard. StrategicIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations. These strategies relate to:•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers•the geographies in which it operates•the types of clients and customers that it serves•the counterparties with which it does business, and •the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments or the expectations of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective 27Part Ibusiness plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:•devise effective business plans and strategies•offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers•allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment•allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations•appropriately address concerns of clients, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders, including with respect to social and sustainability matters•react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of changes in financial regulation, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and changes in economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:•other banks and financial institutions•trading, advisory and investment management firms•finance companies•technology companies, and•other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services.JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws, rules and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies.Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.Climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could have a material adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s business operations, clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its businesses, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be impacted by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, including changes in climate policy or in the regulation of financial institutions with respect to risks posed by climate change.Climate-related physical risks include both acute weather events and chronic shifts in the climate. Potential physical risks from climate change may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency of wildfires, rising sea levels, or a rising heat index.28Transition risks arise from the process of adjusting to a low-carbon economy. In addition to possible changes in climate policy and financial regulation, potential transition risks may include economic and other changes engendered by the development of low-carbon technological advances (e.g., electric vehicles and renewable energy) and/or changes in consumer preferences towards low-carbon goods and services. Transition risks could be further accelerated by the occurrence of changes in the physical climate.These climate-related physical risks and transition risks could have a financial impact on JPMorgan Chase both directly on its business and operations and as a result of material adverse impacts to its clients and customers, including:•declines in asset values•reduced availability of insurance•significant interruptions to business operations, and•negative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences.ConductConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct, and these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation as well as resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur, lead to a violation of the terms of these resolutions (and associated consequences), or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include:•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading•engaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in connection with government relief programs•facilitating a transaction where a material objective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting or financial disclosure treatment that may be subject to scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities, or where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not reflect the economic substance of the transaction•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers•violating antitrust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices•engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or acting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace•managing or reporting risks in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business performance goals or employee compensation objectives, and•misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.The consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:•financial losses•increased operational and compliance costs•greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties•regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management•loss of clients or customers, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.29Part IReputationDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects, and can arise from numerous sources, including:•employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment with respect to clients, customers or employees, or actions that are contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace•security breaches, including as a result of cyber attacks•failure to safeguard client, customer or employee information•failure to manage risk issues associated with its business activities or those of its clients, including failure to fully discharge publicly-announced commitments to support social and sustainability initiatives•compliance or operational failures•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions •regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and •failure or perceived failure of clients, customers, counterparties or other parties to comply with laws, rules or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.Social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities. Activists have also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses social and sustainability concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients and customers, and with governmental or regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could: •cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase •impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers•diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain employees•prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers.•cause certain investors to divest from investments in securities of JPMorgan Chase, or•attract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory bodies.Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the reputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged by concerns that:•consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, •a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customersIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in, or having one or more investments related to, the same transaction•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality30•treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or •handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and regulations. A failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.CountryAn outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally. Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:•worldwide economic disruption•heightened volatility in financial markets•severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments•substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region•disruption of global trade, and •diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain countries can be adversely affected by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile or may have political, legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local economy and business activity are subject to substantial government influence or control. Some of these countries have in the past experienced economic disruptions, including:•extreme currency fluctuations•high inflation•low or negative growth, and•defaults or reduced ability to service sovereign debt.The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, including:•price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions or forced currency exchange•expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and•changes in laws, rules and regulations. The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions or governmental actions, including: •widespread demonstrations or civil unrest•general strikes and demonstrations•crime and corruption•security and personal safety issues•outbreaks of hostilities•overthrow of incumbent governments•terrorist attacks, and •other forms of internal discord. These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future 31Part Icould lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.PeopleJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified and diverse employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain, develop and motivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified and diverse employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.Unfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration or travel policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or travel to or transfer between, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide or regional operating models that cause its operations to be less efficient or more costly.LegalJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from litigation and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.32"
6,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2020-02-25,"Risk Factors
. The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.RegulatoryJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws, rules and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. Regulation of financial services is extensive.JPMorgan Chase has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, both within and outside the U.S. The supervision of financial services firms also expanded  significantly. The increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations. Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its business and operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce its profitability. For example, existing and new laws and regulations have in the past and could in the future require JPMorgan Chase to:•limit the products and services that it offers•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities•stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue•recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds•pay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other governmental charges, including in connection with the resolution of tax examinations•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s business.The content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:•larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation•financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or •the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.These differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries 6  and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory initiative or standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:•the resolution of financial institutions•the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies or operating subsidiaries•requirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries•the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities•requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives•governance and accountability regimes•conduct of business requirements, and•restrictions on compensation.These types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to:•divest assets or restructure its operations•absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs •change the prices that it charges for its products and services •curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or •incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability. Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations.JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:•greater exposure in civil litigation•damage to reputation•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or•other direct and indirect adverse effects.Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:•loss of clients, customers and business•restrictions on offering certain products or services, and •losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.JPMorgan Chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. JPMorgan Chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions. Furthermore, if JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet   7Part Ithe heightened standards established by its regulators, it could be required to:•enter into further resolutions of investigations or enforcement actions•pay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.Complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks.JPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject JPMorgan Chase, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.JPMorgan Chase’s operations can be constrained in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.If the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less predictable, this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business. For example, any of the following could hamper JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings in these types of countries:•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions•conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual, intellectual property or other obligations•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and •the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the  suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.Conducting business in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory regimes could require JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to fully understand and to conduct its business in compliance with the laws and regulations of all of the jurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of non-compliance can be greater in countries that have less predictable legal and regulatory systems. Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses.JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to serve clients and customers.If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. After two years, if the deficiencies are not cured, the agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy. Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either: •in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  •in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  8  If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.   Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.  PoliticalThe departure of the U.K. from the EU could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations and operating model.It remains highly uncertain how the departure of the U.K. from the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,” will affect financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase that conduct substantial operations in the EU from legal entities that are organized in or operating from the U.K. It is possible that the transition period following the U.K.’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020 will expire on December 31, 2020 without any agreement having been reached between the U.K. and the EU concerning whether or to what extent U.K.-based firms may conduct financial services activities within the EU. It is also possible that any  agreement reached between the U.K. and the EU may, depending on the final outcome of the ongoing negotiations and related legislative developments:•impede the ability of U.K.-based financial services firms to conduct business in the EU•fail to address significant unresolved issues relating to the cross-border conduct of financial services activities, or•apply only temporarily.JPMorgan Chase has been making appropriate modifications to its legal entity structure and operations in the EU, the locations in which it operates and the staffing in those locations to address the departure of the U.K. from the EU. If the U.K. and the EU fail to reach an agreement on their future relationship before the end of the transition period or if any other outcome persists that does not assure ongoing access for U.K.-based financial services firms to the EU market, the types of structural and operational changes that JPMorgan Chase is in the process of making to its European operations may result in JPMorgan Chase having to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its U.K., EU and other operating entities. Due to considerations such as operating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital, the modified European operating framework will be more complex, less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case. A disorderly withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, or unexpected consequences of the withdrawal, could have significant and immediate destabilizing effects on economic and market conditions in the region and globally. In particular, cross-border financial services activities could be severely disrupted depending on circumstances that may exist following the withdrawal, including:•the possibility that financial institutions, their clients and counterparties, and other market participants may not be positioned to continue to do business through EU-based legal entities •reduction or fragmentation of market liquidity that may be caused if significant market participants (including trading venues and CCPs) that are currently based in the U.K. have not completed arrangements to conduct operations from the EU either in the near term or, if authorized to continue to operate from the U.K. on a transitional basis, after any transitional or temporary relief has expired•uncertainties concerning the application and interpretation of laws and regulations relating to cross-border financial services activities•inability to engage in certain financial services activities through EU-based legal entities to the extent that licenses or temporary permission to engage in such activities have not been granted timely by local regulators  9Part I•unexpected or unfavorable changes in laws and regulations, governmental policies or public sentiment, and •losses due to process errors or incorrect judgments concerning economic, political or regulatory developments.Any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the European financial services market as well as JPMorgan Chase’s business, operations and earnings in the U.K., the EU and globally.Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the U.S. and other countries. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets, including:•monetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any suspension or reversal of large-scale asset purchases•inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open•isolationist foreign policies•the implementation of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies•political pressure on monetary policy decisions of central banks, or•the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “U.S. GSEs”). These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency •provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations •increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and•result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries.These factors could lead to:•slower growth rates, rising inflation or recession•greater market volatility •a contraction of available credit and the widening of credit spreads •diminished investor and consumer confidence•lower investment growth•large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries•reduced commercial activity among trading partners•the potential for a currency redenomination by a particular country•the possible departure of a country from, or the dissolution of, a political or economic alliance or treaty•potential expropriation or nationalization of assets •other market dislocations, including the spread of unfavorable economic conditions from a particular country or region to other countries or regions.Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.MarketEconomic and market events and conditions can materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and investment and market-making positions.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:•investor, consumer and business sentiment•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets•inflation or deflation•high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market•the availability and cost of capital, liquidity and credit•levels and volatility of interest rates (including overnight repo rates), credit spreads and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility•the economic effects of outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, cyberattacks, climate change, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, and•the health of the U.S. and global economies.All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions.10  In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s investment portfolio and market-making businesses can suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:•severe declines in asset values•unexpected credit events•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)•the inability to effectively hedge market and other risks related to market-making position, or•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:•interest rates•the rates of inflation and unemployment•housing prices•the level of consumer and small business confidence•changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt, and•the number of personal bankruptcies.A rapid increase in interest rates could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. Sustained low growth, low or negative interest rates, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. These conditions could also increase the cost to provide those products and services. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity, or where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:•policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration and employment status •the inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded, and •policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income.In addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers. Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses.In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including its loan syndication, securities underwriting and leveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions, or•dispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss, or hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress.The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse   11Part Imacroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.An economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Severe and sustained adverse economic conditions could reduce the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from those properties which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing higher delinquencies, defaults and write-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses.Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and income streams. JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are increasing. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:•fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans•losses on underwriting exposures•the loss of deposits, including in the event that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior•lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings•less liquidity in the financial markets, and•higher funding costs.All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may  reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. On the other hand, a low or negative interest rate environment may cause:•net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments•unanticipated or adverse changes in depositor behavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s broader asset and liability management strategy, and•a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s financial instruments which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes, including its stress testing framework, seek to quantify and control JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan Chase could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur. Under extreme market conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at 12  mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions.CreditJPMorgan Chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions and market participants. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation if a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, including under the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.A default by, or the financial or operational failure of, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses. As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to bearing its share of non-default losses incurred by a CCP, including losses from custodial, settlement or investment activities or due to cyber or other security breaches.Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. The financial or operational failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting. JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a significant market participant, and would seek to unwind or hedge positions in securities, derivatives and other obligations in multiple jurisdictions during a period of heightened market volatility. JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to it. Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:•engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries•do business in the same geographic region, or•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or   13Part Idependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital position, funding costs and the profitability of its businesses.LiquidityLiquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses. JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:•market-wide illiquidity or disruption•unforeseen liquidity or capital requirements, including as a result of changes in laws, rules and regulations•inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices•default by a CCP or other significant market participant•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral•unexpected loss of consumer deposits caused by changes in consumer behavior, and•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during periods of market stress, low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity could result in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity. There is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur. JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements•address obligations under its resolution plan, or•satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries (including, in particular, its broker-dealer subsidiaries), and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding company. The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to:•pay interest on its debt securities•pay dividends on its equity securities•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and14  •fulfill its other payment obligations.These regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:•expected future profitability •risk management practices•legal expenses•ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries•regulatory developments •assumptions about government support, and •economic and geopolitical trends. JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:•reducing its access to capital markets •materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities •triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and •decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. The reform and replacement of benchmark rates could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s funding, investments and financial products, and expose it to litigation and other disputes.Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,” including those in widespread and long-standing use, have been the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated. Any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks.Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.Various regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks. There is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants, or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace. If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark, this could result in widespread dislocation in the financial markets, engender volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations. In addition, to the extent that appropriate relief is not provided by accounting standard setters with respect to the transition from benchmark rates, the transition could:•affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to a particular benchmark and any related derivatives, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations, or•increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs with respect to the determination of whether the transition   15Part Ihas resulted in the modification or extinguishment of specific contracts for accounting purposes.Representatives of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), have made a series of public statements during the past several years to the effect that:•the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021, and•once a significant number of banks are no longer submitting such rates, the FCA may make a determination under applicable regulations that the LIBOR benchmark may not meet the standards required under those regulations for use as a benchmark.These statements indicate that it is highly likely that LIBOR will be discontinued on or about the end of 2021. Vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the LIBOR benchmark, and any inability of market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption in the financial markets and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on LIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments which are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase could also become involved in litigation and other types of disputes with clients, customers, counterparties and investors as a consequence of the transition from LIBOR and other benchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims that JPMorgan Chase has: •treated clients, customers, counterparties or investors unfairly, or caused them to experience losses, higher financing costs or lower returns on investments•failed to appropriately communicate the effects of the transition from benchmark rates on the products that JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and customers,   or failed to disclose purported conflicts of interest•made inappropriate product recommendations to or investments on behalf of its clients, or sold products that did not serve their intended purpose, in connection with the transition from benchmark rates•engaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the manipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in connection with the discontinuation of or transition from benchmark rates, or•disadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or investors when interpreting or making determinations under the terms of agreements or financial instruments. These types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to higher legal expenses and operational costs, require it to pay significant amounts in connection with resolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its reputation.CapitalMaintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital is critical to support JPMorgan Chase’s business activities, meet regulatory requirements and distribute capital to shareholders.JPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory capital requirements, and although many of these requirements have been finalized, prudential regulators have recently issued new regulatory capital proposals, and continued uncertainty remains as to the manner in which these requirements ultimately will apply to JPMorgan Chase. As a result, it is possible that these requirements could limit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support its businesses and make capital distributions to its shareholders.JPMorgan Chase is required to submit, on an annual basis, a capital plan describing proposed dividend payments to shareholders, redemptions and repurchases of its outstanding securities and other capital actions that it intends to take. JPMorgan Chase considers various factors in the management of capital, including the impact of stress on its capital levels, as determined by both internal modeling and the Federal Reserve’s modeling of JPMorgan Chase’s capital position in supervisory stress tests and CCAR. Because the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase use different forecasting models and methodologies when determining stress test results, there can be significant differences between the estimates of stress loss as determined by the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase, respectively. The Federal Reserve may object to or require modifications to JPMorgan Chase’s capital plan, or JPMorgan Chase may otherwise modify its capital plan, and any such modification could have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders, including by:•constraining the amount of dividends that may be paid on common stock•reducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan Chase is permitted to repurchase•requiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the redemption of, capital instruments in a manner inconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management strategy•curtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or operations, or•damaging JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.16  OperationalJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on:•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and•JPMorgan Chase’s ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies. The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•delays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers•the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets, including those for which physical settlement and delivery is required•failure to timely settle or confirm transactions•the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences•financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable•client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase’s products and services •loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continue to increase, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:•errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues•failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and•third parties may attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the demanding standards of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. Any significant failure in this regard could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:•potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers•increased operating expenses•higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity  17Part I•regulatory intervention, or •weaker competitive standing.Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s connections to external operational systems expose it to greater operational risks.External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown of another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, cloud computing services and personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems•losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations•increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach, and•harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties expands, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.JPMorgan Chase’s operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, and to maintain an effective risk management framework is highly dependent on the competence and integrity of its employees, as well as employees of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by:•the ineffective implementation of business decisions•any failure to institute controls that appropriately address risks associated with business activities, or to appropriately train employees with respect to those risks and controls•a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or•other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations depend.JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include:•JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, and prospective clients and customers•clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers•employees and prospective employees, and•employees of JPMorgan Chase’s vendors, counterparties and other external parties.Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:•increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs18  •hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and •require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or•intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties.Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.In recent years, well-publicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information. These types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers. These restrictions could also inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers. A successful cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis from various actors, including cyber-criminals and “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change). These cyberattacks can take many forms, but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These viruses or malicious code are typically designed to:•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•manipulate or destroy data•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or•steal money.JPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services.JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks. However, JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:•the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched•cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally•JPMorgan Chase does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business•third parties may seek to gain access to JPMorgan Chase’s systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers,   19Part Ithird-party service providers or other users of JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and•it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.The risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems•misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators•damage to computers or systems of JPMorgan Chase and those of its clients, customers and counterparties•inability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions•violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,  customers, counterparties or employees•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity measures•dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers or counterparties•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide full and reliable information about  the cyberattack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, as well as the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyberattack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack.JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events or contributing factors that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including:•cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises, including data centers•power, telecommunications or internet outages•failures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets•damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase•effects of climate change•natural disasters or severe weather conditions•accidents such as explosions or structural failures•health emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or pandemics, or•events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a firmwide resiliency program that is intended to enable it to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. In particular, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond effectively to a business interruption could be hampered to the extent that the members of its workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure needed to address the event are geographically dispersed, or conversely, if a catastrophic event occurs in an area in which a critical segment of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce, physical assets or systems and other support infrastructure is concentrated. In addition, should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. 20  Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or any catastrophic event, could:•hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption•cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm its reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, governance structure, practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any such inadequacy or lapse could:•require significant resources to remediate•attract heightened regulatory scrutiny•expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings•subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior.  These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated.  Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses. JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate.JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to measure, monitor and implement controls over its market, credit, liquidity, operational and other risks. These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:•reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan Chase’s capital actions could also be constrained if a CCAR submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations.Enhanced regulatory and other standards for the oversight of vendors and other service providers can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced regulatory and other standards associated with doing business with vendors and other service providers, including standards relating to the outsourcing of functions as well as the performance of significant banking and other functions by subsidiaries. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and   21Part Iexpenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its internal and external service providers. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage these relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:•potential liability to clients and customers•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•lower revenues, and the opportunity cost from lost revenues•increased operational costs, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect.Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining the allowance for credit losses and reserves related to litigation. Certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements, including:•trading assets and liabilities•instruments in the investment portfolio•certain loans•MSRs•structured notes, and •certain repurchase and resale agreements.Where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment, and these types of estimates and judgments may not prove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as noted above. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments, which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates or judgments underlying JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan Chase may experience material losses.JPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures. It then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the amounts of capital and liquidity that would be needed in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult,  subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. It is possible that JPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could:•materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition•restrict its ability to access the capital markets •require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies.The preparation of JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as more detailed accounting policies established by JPMorgan Chase’s management. From time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change, and in some cases these changes could have a significant effect on JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results. As of January 1, 2020, JPMorgan Chase has implemented a new accounting standard, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) framework, which requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments. The allowance for credit losses related to JPMorgan Chase’s loans and other lending-related commitments increased as a result of the implementation of CECL, which has a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s capital levels.The ongoing impact of the adoption of CECL could include the following, each of which could result in diminished investor confidence:•greater volatility in JPMorgan Chase’s earnings and capital levels over economic cycles22  •potential reductions in its capital distributions, or•unexpected increases in the allowance for credit losses.In addition, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates, including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products, particularly during periods of economic stress, as well as changes related to non-U.S. financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this accounting standard. StrategicIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and operations. These strategies relate to:•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers•the geographies in which it operates•the types of clients and customers that it serves•the counterparties with which it does business, and •the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.JPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:•devise effective business plans and strategies•offer products and services that meet changing expectations of clients and customers•allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment•allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations•appropriately address shareholder concerns •react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Additionally, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management’s significant strategic decisions, and a failure by the Board to perform this function could also impair JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.JPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing competition in the rapidly evolving financial services industry.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment in which it must evolve and adapt to the significant changes as a result of financial regulatory reform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny and current economic conditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:•other banks and financial institutions•trading, advisory and investment management firms•finance companies and technology companies, and•other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services.JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income   23Part Ithat JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies.Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other factors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.Climate change could have a material adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s business operations, clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and communities around the world where its businesses, and the activities of its clients and customers, could be disrupted by climate change. Potential physical risks from climate change may include:•altered distribution and intensity of rainfall•prolonged droughts or flooding•increased frequency of wildfires•rising sea levels•rising heat indexIn addition, these physical changes may prompt changes in regulations or consumer preferences which in turn could have negative consequences for the business models of JPMorgan Chase’s clients.These climate driven changes could have a material adverse impact on asset values and the financial performance of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, and those of its clients and customers.ConductConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan  Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct, and these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation as well as resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include:•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading•facilitating illegal or aggressive tax-motivated transactions, or transactions designed to circumvent economic sanction programs•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers•violating anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices•engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment•making risk decisions in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to employee compensation objectives, and•misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.The consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:•financial losses•increased operational and compliance costs24  •greater scrutiny by regulators and other parties•regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management•loss of clients or customers, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.ReputationDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects. Harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including:•employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment•security breaches, including cyberattacks•failure to safeguard client, customer or employee information•failure to manage environmental, social and sustainability risk issues associated with its business activities or those of its clients•compliance or operational failures•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions •regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters, and •failure or perceived failure of clients, customers, counterparties or other parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors with which JPMorgan Chase does business.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be published or broadcast by the media or posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet. This latter risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.Social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to human health, or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’  rights or communities. Activists have also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses social and environmental concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients and customers, and with governmental bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could: •cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase •impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers•diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain employees, or•prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients or customers.Actions by the financial services industry generally or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers, can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole. If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, this could weaken its reputation among clients or customers.Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest is highly complex due to the broad range of its business activities which encompass a variety of transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest, including potential conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with providing multiple products and services in the same transaction•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality•treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care  25Part I•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or •handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations. In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.CountryAn outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally. Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyberattacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:•worldwide economic disruption•heightened volatility in financial markets•severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments•substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region•disruption of global trade, and •diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or regions directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyberattacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict. JPMorgan Chase’s business activities with governmental entities can pose an enhanced risk of loss.Several of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, both within and outside the U.S. These activities can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, as governmental entities have in the past, and may in the future, taken actions such as:•defaulting on or restructuring their obligations•claiming that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, or•repudiating transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government.Any or all of these actions could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation, particularly if JPMorgan Chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers.JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including:•extreme currency fluctuations•high inflation•low or negative growth, and•defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt.The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, including:•price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions•expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and•changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations 26  in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. For example, some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to JPMorgan Chase, or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client, being effectively trapped in a country. In addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely, JPMorgan Chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy.In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions, as well as natural disasters, including: •social unrest•general strikes and demonstrations•crime and corruption•security and personal safety issues•outbreaks of hostilities•overthrow of incumbent governments•terrorist attacks, and •other forms of internal discord. These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S.PeopleJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected. Unfavorable changes in immigration policies could adversely affect the quality of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide operating model that are less efficient or more costly.LegalJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase.   27Part IThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters"
7,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2019-02-26,"Risk Factors
. The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm. Any of the risk factors discussed below could by itself, or combined with other factors, materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition, capital position, liquidity, competitive position or reputation, including by materially increasing expenses or decreasing revenues, which could result in material losses or a decrease in earnings.RegulatoryJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its business and operations.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. The regulation of financial services is extensive and comprehensive.JPMorgan Chase has experienced an extended period of significant change in laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, both within and outside the U.S. The supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly during this period. The wave of increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts its business and structures its operations. Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its business and operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations and could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability. More specifically, existing and new laws and regulations could require JPMorgan Chase to:•limit the products and services that it offers•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities•stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue•recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds•pay higher assessments, levies or other governmental charges•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them. Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s business.The content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, and other criteria. For example:•larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation•financial technology companies and other non-traditional competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or •the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that jurisdiction.These types of differences in the regulatory framework can result in a firm such as JPMorgan Chase losing market share to competitors that are less regulated or not subject to regulation, especially with respect to unregulated financial products.There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in other countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when adopting rules that are intended to implement a global regulatory initiative or standard, a national regulator may introduce additional or more restrictive requirements, which can create competitive disadvantages for financial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that may be subject to those enhanced regulations.Legislative and regulatory initiatives outside the U.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in the relevant countries or regions in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:•the resolution of financial institutions•the establishment of locally-based intermediate holding companies•the separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking products and services from markets activities•requirements for executing or settling transactions on exchanges or through central counterparties (“CCPs”)•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives•governance and accountability regimes•conduct of business requirements, and•restrictions on compensation.  7Part IThese types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to:•divest assets or restructure its operations•absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs •change the prices that it charges for its products and services •curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or •incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.Governments in some countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries that operate in those jurisdictions to maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a stand-alone basis. Some regulators outside the U.S. have also proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those jurisdictions. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that impose restrictions on the way JPMorgan Chase organizes its businesses or increase the capital or liquidity requirements that would apply to JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries, could hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs, and result in lower profitability. Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations.JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines, provided other monetary relief, incurred other penalties and experienced other repercussions in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such resolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs or needing to comply with other restrictions. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the  activities that gave rise to the resolution. These types of admissions can lead to:•greater exposure in civil litigation•damage to reputation•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or•other direct and indirect adverse effects.Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including:•loss of clients, customers and business•restrictions on offering certain products or services, and •losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.JPMorgan Chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. JPMorgan Chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions. Furthermore, if JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any resolution of a governmental investigation or enforcement action, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators, it could be required to:•enter into further resolutions•pay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.In these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also become subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution or civil litigation with respect to the conduct that gave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.The long-term impact of U.S. tax reform legislation is uncertain, and may be affected by regulatory implementation.The long-term impact of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Acts (“TCJA”) on JPMorgan Chase and the U.S. economy remains uncertain. While the enactment of the TCJA has had, and should continue to have, a positive impact on JPMorgan Chase’s net income, the competitive environment and other 8  factors will influence the extent to which these benefits are retained by JPMorgan Chase over the longer term, and the specific impact on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, products and geographies may vary. In addition, the Treasury Regulations governing certain TCJA provisions have not been finalized and their ultimate impact on JPMorgan Chase is uncertain. Complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks.JPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject JPMorgan Chase, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.JPMorgan Chase’s operations can be constrained in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory frameworks.If the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less established or predictable, this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business. For example, any of the following could hamper JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings in countries with less established or predictable legal and regulatory regimes:•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions•the adoption of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual obligations•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and •the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.Conducting business in countries with less-developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires JPMorgan Chase to  devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that JPMorgan Chase will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses.JPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of the Firm’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities, which could increase its funding or operational costs.If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to determine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. After two years, if the deficiencies are not cured, the agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy. Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution either: •in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or  •in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).  If the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company will absorb the losses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.   9Part IThe preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent Company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the Parent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.   Accordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the Parent Company would realize value only to the extent available to the Parent Company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the Parent Company have been fully repaid. The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the Parent Company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy. If the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into, a resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Parent Company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than they might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy.  PoliticalThe expected departure of the U.K. from the EU could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations and operating model.It remains highly uncertain how the expected departure of the U.K. from the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,” will affect financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase that conduct substantial operations in the EU from legal entities that are organized in or operating from the U.K. It is possible that the U.K. will depart from the EU in March 2019 without any agreement having been reached between the U.K. and the EU concerning whether or to what extent U.K.-based firms may conduct financial services activities within the EU. It is also possible that any agreement reached between the U.K. and the EU may, depending on the final outcome of the ongoing negotiations and related legislative developments:•impede the ability of U.K.-based financial services firms to conduct business in the EU •fail to address significant unresolved issues relating to the cross-border conduct of financial services activities, or•apply only temporarily.JPMorgan Chase has been making the necessary modifications to its legal entity structure and operations in the EU, the locations in which it operates and the staffing in those locations to address the expected departure of the U.K. from the EU, including the possibility that the U.K. may depart from the EU in March 2019 without a withdrawal agreement in place. If the U.K. departs from the EU with no withdrawal agreement having been reached, the types of structural and operational changes that JPMorgan Chase is in the process of making to its European operations will result in JPMorgan Chase having to sustain a more fragmented operating model across its U.K., EU and other operating entities. Due to considerations such as operating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital, the modified European operating framework will be more complex, less efficient and more costly than would otherwise have been the case. JPMorgan Chase may experience these types of inefficiencies in its business and operations even if a withdrawal agreement is reached, for example in the event that during the transition period contemplated by such an agreement, the U.K. and the EU fail to reach further agreement on future trade relationships between the U.K. and the EU, or if any other outcome persists that does not assure ongoing access for U.K.-based financial services firms to the EU market.A disorderly departure of the U.K. from the EU, or the unexpected consequences of any departure, could have significant and immediate destabilizing effects on cross-border financial services activities, depending on circumstances that may exist following such a withdrawal, including:•the possibility that clients and counterparties of financial institutions are not positioned to continue to do business through EU-based legal entities •reduction or fragmentation of market liquidity that may be caused if trading venues or CCPs currently based in the U.K. have not completed arrangements to conduct operations from the EU either immediately or, if authorized to continue to operate from the U.K. on a transitional basis, after any transitional relief has expired•uncertainties concerning the application and interpretation of laws and regulations relating to cross-border financial services activities•inability to engage in certain capital markets activities through EU-based legal entities to the extent that licenses or temporary permission to engage in such activities have not been granted timely by local regulators, and 10  •lack of legal certainty concerning the treatment of existing transactions.Any or all of the above factors could have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the European financial services market as well as JPMorgan Chase’s business, operations and earnings in the U.K., the EU and globally.Economic uncertainty or instability caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to political developments in the U.S. and other countries. Certain policy initiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets, including:•inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded•isolationist foreign policies•the introduction of tariffs and other protectionist trade policies, or •the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the “GSEs”). These types of political developments, and uncertainty about the possible outcomes of these developments, could:•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets, which could potentially undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency •provoke retaliatory countermeasures by other countries and otherwise heighten tensions in diplomatic relations •increase concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and•result in periodic shutdowns of the U.S. government or governments in other countries.These factors could lead to:•greater market volatility•large-scale sales of government debt and other debt and equity securities in the U.S. and other countries•the widening of credit spreads •inflationary pressures•lower investment growth, and •other market dislocations. Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses on its market-making positions or in its investment securities portfolio, reduce its liquidity and capital levels, hamper its ability to deliver products and  services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations and financial condition.MarketJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market events and conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:•investor, consumer and business sentiment•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets•inflation or deflation•high unemployment or, conversely, a tightening labor market•the availability and cost of capital and credit•monetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks or governmental authorities, including any suspension or reversal of large-scale asset purchases•trade policies implemented by governmental authorities •the economic effects of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities, and•the health of the U.S. and global economies.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively affected by adverse economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. and global economic conditions, including:•interest rates•the rates of inflation and unemployment•housing prices•the level of consumer and small business confidence•changes in consumer spending or in the level of consumer debt, and•the number of personal bankruptcies.A rapid increase in interest rates could negatively affect consumer credit performance to the extent that consumers are less able to service their debts. Sustained low growth, inflationary pressures or recessionary conditions could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. These conditions could also increase the cost to provide those products and services. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity,   11Part Ior where high levels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student loans, impair the ability of customers to pay their other consumer loan obligations.JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by governmental policies and actions that affect consumers, including:•policies and initiatives relating to medical insurance, education, immigration and employment status•the inability to reach political consensus to keep the U.S. government open and funded, and •policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income.In addition, governmental proposals to permit student loan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage certain of JPMorgan Chase’s customers to declare personal bankruptcy and thereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit card and other consumer loans extended to those customers. Unfavorable market and economic conditions can have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses.In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for which it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions•dispose of portions of credit commitments, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings, at a loss, or•hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.An adverse change in market conditions in particular segments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe downturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in commodity prices, could have a material adverse effect on clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or financial condition are directly or indirectly dependent on the health or stability of those market segments, as well as clients that are engaged in related businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses on its loans and other credit commitments to clients that operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of the economy that is under stress. The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing client assets or holding assets under custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds under custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.An economic downturn that results in lower consumer and business spending could also have a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale operations. For example, the businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams of rental income from commercial real estate properties which are owned or being built by those clients. Severe and sustained adverse economic conditions could reduce the rental cash flows that owners or developers receive from those properties which, in turn, could depress the values of the properties and impair the ability of borrowers to service or refinance their commercial real estate loans. These consequences could result in JPMorgan Chase experiencing higher delinquencies, defaults and write-offs within its commercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring higher costs for servicing a larger volume of delinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio and market-making positions can suffer losses due to adverse economic, market and political events and conditions.JPMorgan Chase generally maintains positions in various fixed income instruments in its investment securities portfolio, and positions in various fixed income, currency, commodity, credit and equity instruments as part of its market-making activities. Market-making positions are intended to facilitate demand from JPMorgan Chase’s clients for these instruments and to provide liquidity for clients. The value of the positions that JPMorgan Chase holds can be significantly affected by factors such as: •JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively hedge market and other risks on its positions•changes in the levels and volatility of interest rates, credit spreads, and market prices for currencies, equities and commodities, and the duration of any changes in levels or volatility, and12  •the availability of liquidity in the capital markets.All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions on market-making activities.JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio and market-making businesses can also suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:•severe declines in asset values•unexpected credit events•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa), or•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment securities portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its liquidity and capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and income streams. JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are increasing. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:•fewer originations of commercial and residential real estate loans•losses on underwriting exposures•lower returns on JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio•the loss of deposits to the extent that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior•lower net interest income if central banks introduce interest rate increases more quickly than anticipated and this results in a misalignment in the pricing of short-term and long-term borrowings, and•less liquidity in the financial markets and higher funding costs.All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.  On the other hand, a low interest rate environment may cause:•net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments, and•a reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby decreasing revenues.When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. JPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by market fluctuations and significant changes in the value of financial instruments.The value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets can be materially affected by market fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and other disruptions in the financial markets may make it extremely difficult to value certain financial instruments, particularly during periods of market displacement. Subsequent valuations of financial instruments in future periods, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the value of these instruments. In addition, at the time of any disposition of these financial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase ultimately realizes will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could cause a decline in the value of financial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets, which may have an adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations.Under extreme market conditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may not be as effective at mitigating losses as they would be under more normal market conditions. Furthermore, under these conditions, market participants are particularly exposed to trading strategies employed by many market participants simultaneously and on a large scale. JPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring processes seek to quantify and mitigate risk to more extreme market moves. However, severe market events have historically been difficult to predict and JPMorgan Chase could realize significant losses if extreme market events were to occur.  13Part ICreditJPMorgan Chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of clients, counterparties, custodians and CCPs.JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation in the event that a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to provide custodial services for client assets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud or the failure to abide by existing laws and obligations, including under the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.A default by a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes contracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace those contracts, thereby increasing its operational costs and potentially resulting in losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a CCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults on its obligations to the CCP because of requirements that each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those losses.Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses can be harmed by the insolvency of a significant market participant.The failure of a significant market participant, such as a major financial institution or a CCP, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a market participant, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting. These risks could be magnified in the event of the default, insolvency or resolution of a major global financial counterparty, as JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant interrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such a counterparty, and would seek to unwind or hedge positions in securities, derivatives and other obligations in multiple jurisdictions during a period of heightened market volatility. JPMorgan Chase’s clearing services business is exposed to the risk of client or counterparty default.As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is a member of several CCPs. In the event that another member of such an organization defaults on its obligations to the CCP, JPMorgan Chase may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. As a clearing member, JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to bearing its share of nondefault losses incurred by a CCP due to a business or operational failure affecting the CCP, including due to a cyberattack, litigation, fraud or a systems failure. JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to it. Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral.JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:•engage in similar or related businesses, or in businesses in related industries•do business in the same geographic region, or•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other 14  borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit, liquidity and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its market-making businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by bank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition for certain types of consumer loans could prompt industry-wide reactions such as significant reductions in the pricing or margins of those loans or the making of loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.Disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets could cause JPMorgan Chase to be unable to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions in various debt instruments, loans, derivatives and other obligations, and thereby lead to increased risk concentrations. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could increase JPMorgan Chase’s capital requirements and funding costs and adversely affect the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.LiquidityLiquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chase’s ability to fund and operate its businesses. JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:•market-wide illiquidity or disruption•unforeseen cash or capital requirements •inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices•default by a CCP or other significant market participant•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral•unexpected loss of consumer deposits caused by changes in consumer behavior, and•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. A diminution of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, periods of low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity resulted in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity, including securitized debt issuances. There is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur in the future.JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements•address obligations under its resolution plan, or•satisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to the holding company. The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also   15Part Ilimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to:•pay interest on its debt securities•pay dividends on its equity securities•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and•fulfill its other payment obligations.These regulatory restrictions and limitations could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of the capital and liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm-specific and industry-specific factors when determining credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:•expected future profitability •risk management practices•legal expenses•ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries•regulatory developments •assumptions about government support, and •economic and geopolitical trends JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including:•reducing its access to capital markets  •materially increasing its cost of issuing and servicing securities •triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and •decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.The regulation, reform and replacement of benchmark rates could have adverse consequences on JPMorgan Chase’s securities issuances and its capital markets and investment activities.Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,” including those in widespread and long-standing use, have been the subject of ongoing international, national and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented or are under consideration. These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated. Any of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed or implemented, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with regulations or requirements relating to benchmarks. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks.Any of these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued, funded or held by JPMorgan Chase.Various regulators, industry bodies and other market participants in the U.S. and other countries are engaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and encourage the use of alternative rates to replace certain benchmarks. There is no assurance that these new rates will be accepted or widely used by market participants, or that the characteristics of any of these new rates will be similar to, or produce the economic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek to replace. If a particular benchmark were to be discontinued and an alternative rate has not been successfully introduced to replace that benchmark, this could result in widespread 16  dislocation in the financial markets, engender volatility in the pricing of securities, derivatives and other instruments, and suppress capital markets activities, all of which could have adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations. In addition, the transition of a particular benchmark to a replacement rate could affect hedge accounting relationships between financial instruments linked to that benchmark and any related derivatives, which could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s results.On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021, and there is a substantial risk that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. Vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial instruments are linked to the LIBOR benchmark, and any failure by market participants and regulators to successfully introduce benchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement effective transitional arrangements to address the discontinuation of LIBOR could, as noted above, result in disruption in the financial markets, suppress capital markets activities and give rise to litigation claims, all of which could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on LIBOR-linked securities or other instruments which are issued, funded or held by JPMorgan Chase.OperationalJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction execution, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on:•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality or reliability of a particular system and other systems to which it transmits or from which it receives information, and•JPMorgan Chase’s ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure security and operational continuity and adhere to all applicable legal and regulatory requirements.JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and  other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies. The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of operational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends, including due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or other systems failure, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•delays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers•the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets•the possibility that funds transfers, capital markets trades or other transactions are executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences•financial losses, including due to loss-sharing requirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market infrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients and customers•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable•client or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan Chase’s products and services•loss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase, or financial institutions generally, to protect against and withstand operational disruptions, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.As the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and complexity of transactions continues to increase, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain and upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:•errors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market participant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues•failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, could cause disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and•third parties attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of external parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the demanding standards of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations, or if they fail   17Part Ior have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with the introduction of or changes to products, services and delivery platforms.When JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service, introduces a new platform for the delivery or distribution of products or services (including mobile connectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing), or makes changes to an existing product, service or delivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with those changes. For example, ineffective controls over newly-developed electronic trading platforms could inadvertently permit the rapid build-up of unexpected, abnormal or unusually large positions in securities or other financial instruments, or fail to anticipate or address a downturn in market liquidity which leads to sudden or severe changes in asset prices. Any significant failure to identify and mitigate operational risks associated with new products or services or new platforms for delivering or distributing products or services, or changes to existing products, services or delivery platforms, could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:•potential liability to clients, counterparties and customers•increased operating expenses•higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity•regulatory intervention, or •weaker competitive standing.Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s connections to external operational systems expose it to greater operational risks.External operational systems with which JPMorgan is connected, whether directly or indirectly, can be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems failure that may be experienced by a vendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan Chase is directly connected, but also to a systems breakdown of another party to which such a vendor or infrastructure is connected. Similarly, retailers, data aggregators and other external parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational risk. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems,  including through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. If an external party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•heightened risk that external parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems•losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations•increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the external party’s security breach, and•harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.As JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients, customers and other external parties expands, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to the systems of those parties. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting other external parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information, including restricting the access of customers to their accounts. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction.Furthermore, the widespread and expanding interconnectivity among financial institutions, central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.JPMorgan Chase’s operations depend on the competence and integrity of its employees and those of external parties.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses efficiently and profitably, and to offer products and services that meet the expectations of its clients and customers, is highly dependent on the competence and trustworthiness of its employees, as well as employees of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations rely, including vendors, custodians and financial markets infrastructures. JPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure, theft, fraud or other unlawful conduct, or other negative outcomes caused by human error or misconduct by an 18  employee of JPMorgan Chase or of another party on which JPMorgan Chase’s operations depend.JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include:•JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, and prospective clients and customers•clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers•employees and prospective employees, and•employees of JPMorgan Chase’s vendors, counterparties and other external parties.Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:•increase JPMorgan Chase’s compliance and operating costs•hinder the development of new products or services, curtail the offering of existing products or services, or affect how products and services are offered to clients and customers•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and •require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers, vendors, counterparties and other external parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or•intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties.Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection  laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.Recent, well-publicized allegations involving the misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal information have led to expanded governmental scrutiny of practices relating to the safeguarding of personal information and the use or sharing of personal data by companies in the U.S. and other countries. That scrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in the future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws and regulations relating to the use and sharing of personal information. These types of laws and regulations could prohibit or significantly restrict financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from sharing information among affiliates or with third parties such as vendors, and thereby increase compliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s use of personal data when developing or offering products or services to customers. These restrictions could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s development or marketing of certain products or services, or increase the costs of offering them to customers.A successful cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis. These cyberattacks can take many forms, but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These viruses or malicious code are typically designed to:•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•manipulate or destroy data•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or•steal money.JPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services.JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks. However, JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.  19Part IA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because:•the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched•cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally, and•third parties may seek to gain access to JPMorgan Chase’s systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of JPMorgan Chase’s systems.The risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile-payments and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of web-based products and applications.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems•misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators•damage to computers or systems of JPMorgan Chase and those of its clients, customers and counterparties•inability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions•violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,  customers, counterparties or employees•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity measures•dissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients, customers or counterparties•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate  confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.JPMorgan Chase may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security breach due to a cyberattack.A successful breach of JPMorgan Chase’s computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets due to a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to:•the breadth of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and the high volume of transactions that it processes•the large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which JPMorgan Chase does business•the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, and•the possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyberattack, and that damage may continue to spread. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyberattack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack.JPMorgan Chase’s operations, results and reputation could be harmed by catastrophes or other events.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted, and its reputation could be harmed, by events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including:•cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises, including data centers•power, telecommunications or internet outages•failures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets•damage to or loss of property or assets of JPMorgan Chase or third parties, and any consequent injuries, including in connection with any construction projects undertaken by JPMorgan Chase•natural disasters or severe weather conditions20  •health emergencies or pandemics, or •events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a firm-wide resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure the ability to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. Furthermore, should emergency or catastrophic events such as severe or abnormal weather conditions become more chronic, the disruptive effects of those events on JPMorgan Chase’s business and operations, and on its clients, customers, counterparties and employees, could become more significant and long-lasting. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems, or any catastrophic event, could:•hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to provide services to its clients and customers or to transact with its counterparties•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption•cause it to incur losses or liabilities, including from loss of revenue, damage to or loss of property, or injuries•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and•harm its reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework and procedures may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework is intended to mitigate risk and loss. The framework includes both the “first line of defense,” consisting of each line of business  and Treasury and the Chief Investment Office, including their aligned Operations, Technology and Control Management groups, and the “second line of defense,” consisting of Independent Risk Management. JPMorgan Chase has established processes and procedures to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject. However, there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may be existing or future risks that JPMorgan Chase has not appropriately anticipated or identified.Any inadequacy or lapse in JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework, governance structure, procedures and practices, models or reporting systems could expose it to unexpected losses, and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any such inadequacy or lapse could:•require significant resources to remediate •attract heightened regulatory scrutiny•expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings•subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.JPMorgan Chase establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures. It then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. It is possible that JPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.  Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior.  These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated.  Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements could, in some circumstances, limit the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate.JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to assess and implement mitigating controls over its market, credit, liquidity, operational and other risks. These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to   21Part Iidentify, observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:•reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan Chase’s capital actions could also be constrained if a CCAR submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations.Enhanced standards for vendor risk management can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with doing business with vendors and other third-party service providers. These requirements are contained both in bank regulatory regulations and guidance and in certain consent orders to which JPMorgan Chase has been subject. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could result in:•potential liability to clients and customers•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•increased operational costs, or •harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.Requirements for physical settlement and delivery in trading agreements could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational and other risks.Certain of JPMorgan Chase’s markets transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that JPMorgan Chase does not own. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to obtain the obligations within the required timeframe, JPMorgan Chase could forfeit payments otherwise due. Failures could also result in settlement delays, which could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and ability to transact business. Failure to timely settle and confirm transactions could also subject JPMorgan Chase to heightened credit and operational risk, and losses in the event of a default. JPMorgan Chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect.Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation. Certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements, including:•trading assets and liabilities•instruments in the investment securities portfolio•certain loans•MSRs•structured notes, and •certain repurchase and resale agreements.Where quoted market prices are not available for these types of financial instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. Sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain financial instruments, which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates or judgments underlying JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan Chase may experience material losses.Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could:22  •materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition•restrict its ability to access the capital markets •require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or policies.The preparation of JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements is based on accounting standards established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as more detailed accounting policies established by JPMorgan Chase’s management. From time to time these accounting standards or accounting policies may change, and in some cases these changes could have a material effect on JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements and may adversely affect its financial results or investor perceptions of those results. For example, on January 1, 2020, JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. companies will be required to implement a new accounting standard, commonly referred to as the Current Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) framework, which will require earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. JPMorgan Chase expects that under CECL, it will need to, among other things, increase the allowance for credit losses related to its loans and other lending-related commitments, which may have a negative impact on its capital levels. This new accounting standard may result in greater volatility of JPMorgan Chase’s earnings and capital levels over economic cycles and could potentially affect JPMorgan Chase’s capital distribution plans, depending upon final guidance from the regulators. In addition, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely impacted by associated changes in the competitive environment in which it operates, including changes in the availability or pricing of loan products, particularly during periods of economic stress, as well as changes related to non-U.S. financial institutions or other competitors that are not subject to this new accounting standard.  StrategicIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, and to anticipate changes affecting those strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and results of operations. These strategies relate to:•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers•the geographies in which it operates•the types of clients and customers that it serves•the counterparties with which it does business, and •the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. If management makes choices about these strategies and goals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or fail to address changing regulatory and market environments, then the franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer and its earnings could decline.JPMorgan Chase’s growth and prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by any failure on the part of management to:•devise effective business plans and strategies•effectively implement business decisions, including  minimizing bureaucratic processes•institute controls that appropriately address the risks associated with business activities and any changes in those activities•offer products and services that are appropriately priced, meet the changing expectations of clients and customers and are delivered in ways that enhance client and customer satisfaction•allocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term stability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest in market-leading businesses, even in a highly stressed environment•allocate capital appropriately due to imprecise modeling or subjective judgments made in connection with those allocations•adequately respond to regulatory requirements•appropriately address shareholder concerns  23Part I•react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Additionally, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management’s strategic decisions, and a failure by the Board to perform this function could also impair JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations. ConductConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm clients and customers, impact market integrity, damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Conduct risk management is also an integral component of JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct, and these instances of misconduct have resulted in litigation as well as resolutions of governmental investigations or enforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and other civil or criminal sanctions. There is no assurance that further inappropriate or unlawful actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be detected, deterred or prevented.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include:•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading•facilitating illegal or aggressive tax-motivated transactions, or transactions designed to circumvent economic sanction programs•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers •violating anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices•engaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment•making risk decisions in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to employee compensation objectives, and•misappropriating property, confidential or proprietary information, or technology assets belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.The consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies or practices could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:•financial losses•increased operational and compliance costs•greater regulatory scrutiny•regulatory actions that require JPMorgan Chase to restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s managementloss of clients or customers, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.ReputationDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects. Harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including:•employee misconduct, including discriminatory behavior or harassment•security breaches, including cyberattacks•failure to safeguard client or customer information•not appropriately managing social and environmental risk issues associated with its business activities or those of its clients•compliance or operational failures•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and •regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or resolutions of these matters.24  JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of certain third parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.Social and environmental activists are increasingly targeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries, including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to the health of consumers, or whose activities negatively affect or are perceived to negatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or communities. Activists have also engaged in public protests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other properties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients, customers, investors and employees with how JPMorgan Chase addresses social and environmental concerns in its business activities. Alternatively, yielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive industries could damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships with clients and customers, and with governmental bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase does business, whose views are not aligned with those of social and environmental activists. In either case, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could: •cause certain clients and customers to cease doing business with JPMorgan Chase •impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new clients and customers, or to expand its relationships with existing clients and customers•diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain employees, or•prompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with certain clients.Any of the above factors could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and its ability to maintain its competitive standing.Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers, can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole. If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have  engaged in these types of behaviors, the measures needed to address the associated reputational issues could increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and compliance costs and negatively affect its earnings. Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as its business activities encompass more transactions, obligations and interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to:•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality•treat clients and customers with the appropriate standard of care•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or •handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations. In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.CountryAdverse economic and political developments in a country or region, or globally, can have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings can be affected by the monetary, fiscal and other policies adopted by regulatory authorities and agencies in the countries in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Changes in fiscal policies by central banks or regulatory authorities, and the manner in which those policies are executed, are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control and may be difficult to predict. Consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies or the ways in which they are implemented could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations. Some countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase operates or invests, or in which JPMorgan Chase may do business in the future, have in the past experienced severe   25Part Ieconomic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. Concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries, or the possibility that a particular country may decide to depart from a trade, monetary or political pact, can result in a deterioration of economic and market conditions within the affected countries or regions, including:•slowing growth rates, rising inflation or recessionary economic conditions•a contraction of available credit•diminished investor and consumer confidence, including loss of confidence in local banking systems•increased market volatility•reduced commercial activity among trading partners, or •the potential for currency redenomination or the dissolution of a political or economic alliance or treaty.Any or all of these factors could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations in the affected country or region.These developments can also lead to a contagion which causes similar conditions to arise in other countries in the same region or beyond. Furthermore, governments in particular countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase or its clients do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions or as countermeasures to policies or actions taken by other countries or regions. Any or all of these developments could lead to diminished cross-border trade and financing activity within that country or region, all of which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and earnings in those jurisdictions and increase its operational costs. If JPMorgan Chase takes steps to reduce its market and credit risk exposure within a particular country or region that is experiencing economic or political disruption, it may incur losses that are higher than expected because it will be disposing of assets when market conditions are likely to be highly unfavorable.An outbreak of hostilities between countries or within a country or region could have a material adverse effect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses within the affected region or globally. Aggressive actions by hostile governments or groups, including armed conflict or intensified cyberattacks, could expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other countries or escalating into full-scale war with potentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if one or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons. Depending on the scope of the conflict, the hostilities could result in:•worldwide economic disruption•heightened volatility in financial markets •severe declines in asset values, accompanied by widespread sell-offs of investments•substantial depreciation of local currencies, potentially leading to defaults by borrowers and counterparties in the affected region•disruption of global trade, and •diminished consumer, business and investor confidence.Any of the above consequences could have significant negative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and earnings, both in the countries or region directly affected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if the U.S. were to become directly involved in such a conflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any operations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the affected countries or region, as well as in any nation that is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities. JPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and aggressive cyberattacks launched by or under the sponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such a conflict.JPMorgan Chase’s business activities with governmental entities can pose an enhanced risk of loss.Several of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, both within and outside the U.S. These activities can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may:•default on or restructure its obligations•claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, or•repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government.Any or all of these actions could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation, particularly if JPMorgan Chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers.JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local economic, political, regulatory and social factors.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including:•extreme currency fluctuations26  •high inflation•low or negative growth, and•defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt.The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive policies that adversely affect the local and regional business environment, including:•price, capital or exchange controls, including imposition of punitive transfer and convertibility restrictions•expropriation or nationalization of assets or confiscation of property, including intellectual property, and•changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. For example, some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to JPMorgan Chase, or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client, being effectively trapped in a country. In addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely, JPMorgan Chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy.In addition, emerging markets countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions, including: •social unrest•general strikes and demonstrations•crime and corruption•security and personal safety issues•outbreaks of hostilities•overthrow of incumbent governments•terrorist attacks, and •other forms of internal discord. These economic, political, regulatory and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations. In addition, any of these events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S. CompetitionThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations will suffer if it is not a strong, effective and forward-looking competitor.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:•other banks and financial institutions•trading, advisory and investment management firms•finance companies and technology companies, and•other nonbank firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services.JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.New competitors in the financial services industry continue to emerge. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payments processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payments processing and other services could be significantly disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. In addition, new technologies may be used by customers, or breached or infiltrated by third parties, in unexpected ways, which can increase JPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws and regulations that apply to the offering of products and services through those technologies and reduce the income that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing products and services through those new technologies.Ongoing or increased competition may put pressure on the pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share, particularly with respect to traditional banking products such as deposits and bank accounts. This competition may be on the basis of quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions, under-performance, a decision not to offer a particular product or service, changes in client and customer expectations or other   27Part Ifactors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.Non-U.S. competitors of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses outside the U.S. are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial services institutions can put JPMorgan Chase and those firms at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors. This could reduce the revenue and profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, resulting from: •prohibitions on engaging in certain transactions •higher capital and liquidity requirements•making JPMorgan Chase’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients, and•adversely affecting JPMorgan Chase’s cost structure for providing certain products.PeopleJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.Unfavorable changes in immigration policies could adversely affect the quality of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and expertise of employees located throughout the world. Changes in immigration policies in the U.S. and other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for employees or their family members to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and thereby dilute the quality of its workforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make structural changes to its worldwide operating model that are less efficient or more costly. LegalJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory and government investigations.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in many legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory and government investigations related to its businesses and operations.Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in resolutions or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal, state or local agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences. In addition, the extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters"
13,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2018-02-27,"Risk Factors
. The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.RegulatoryJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and the laws and regulations that apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact on its operations.JPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with operations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with the laws and regulations that apply to its operations in all of the jurisdictions around the world in which it does business. The regulation of financial services activities is typically extensive and comprehensive.In recent years, legislators and regulators adopted a wide range of new laws and regulations affecting the financial services industry, both within and outside the U.S. The supervision of financial services firms also expanded significantly during this period. The wave of increased regulation and supervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way that it conducts and structures its operations. Existing and new laws and regulations and expanded supervision could require JPMorgan Chase to make further changes to its operations. These changes could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring additional costs for complying with laws and regulations or losing a significant amount of revenue, and could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability. More specifically, existing and new laws and regulations could require JPMorgan Chase to:•limit the products and services that it offers•reduce the liquidity that it can provide through its market-making activities•stop or discourage it from engaging in business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue•recognize losses in the value of assets that it holds8  •pay higher assessments, levies or other governmental charges•dispose of certain assets, and do so at times or prices that are disadvantageous•impose restrictions on certain business activities, or•increase the prices that it charges for products and services, which could reduce the demand for them.Differences in financial services regulation can be disadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s business.The content and application of laws and regulations affecting financial services firms sometimes vary according to factors such as the size of the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized or operates, or other criteria. For example:•larger firms are often subject to more stringent supervision and regulation•financial technology companies and other competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be supervised by a national or state regulatory agency that does not have the same resources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory agencies which supervise more diversified financial services firms, or •the financial services regulatory framework in a particular jurisdiction may favor financial institutions that are based in that country.There can also be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, legislative and regulatory initiatives within the EU could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant modifications to its operations and legal entity structure in that region in order to comply with those requirements. These include laws and regulations that have been adopted or proposed relating to:•the resolution of financial institutions•the establishment by non-EU financial institutions of intermediate holding companies in the EU•the separation of trading activities from core banking services•mandatory on-exchange trading•position limits and reporting rules for derivatives•governance and accountability regimes•conduct of business requirements, and•restrictions on compensation.These types of differences in financial services regulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between laws and regulations between different jurisdictions, could require JPMorgan Chase to, among other things: •divest assets or restructure its operations•absorb increased operational, capital and liquidity costs •change the prices that it charges for its products and services •curtail the products and services that it offers to its customers and clients, or •incur higher costs for complying with different legal and regulatory frameworks. Any or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan Chase’s ability to compete against other firms that are not subject to the same laws and regulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and profitability.Governments in some countries in which JPMorgan Chase does business have adopted laws or regulations which require that JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries which operate in those countries maintain minimum amounts of capital or liquidity on a stand-alone basis. Some regulators outside the U.S. have also proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that impose restrictions on the way JPMorgan Chase organizes its businesses or increase the capital or liquidity requirements that would apply to JPMorgan Chase subsidiaries, could hinder JPMorgan Chase’s ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs, and result in lower profitability. Heightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses has increased its compliance costs and could result in restrictions on its operations.JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened oversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in many jurisdictions where JPMorgan Chase does business. JPMorgan Chase has paid significant fines or provided other monetary relief in connection with resolving several investigations and enforcement actions by governmental agencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to similar regulatory settlements or other actions in the future, and addressing the requirements of any such settlement could result in JPMorgan Chase incurring higher operational and compliance costs. In connection with resolving specific regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, certain regulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions to admit wrongdoing with respect to the activities that gave rise to the settlement. These types of admissions can lead to:•greater exposure in civil litigation•damage to reputation•disqualification from doing business with certain clients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or  9Part I•other direct and indirect adverse effects.Furthermore, U.S. government officials have demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions and have increasingly demanded that institutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or admit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, these resolutions have included:•JPMorgan Chase’s agreement in May 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities, and•the non-prosecution agreement entered into by a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase with the U.S. Department of Justice in November 2016 in connection with settlements to resolve various governmental investigations relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. Resolutions of this type can have significant collateral consequences for the subject financial institution, including loss of clients, customers and business, the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, either temporarily or permanently.JPMorgan Chase expects that it and other financial services firms will continue to be subject to expanded regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions. JPMorgan Chase also expects that regulators will continue to insist that financial institutions be penalized for actual or deemed violations of law with formal and punitive enforcement actions, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving these matters through informal supervisory actions. Furthermore, if JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of any governmental settlements and other actions to which it is subject, or to maintain risk and control processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators, it could be required to, among other things:•enter into further orders and settlements•pay additional regulatory fines, penalties or judgments, or•accept material regulatory restrictions on, or changes in the management of, its businesses.The extent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in some cases, exceed the amount of reserves that JPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.Requirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to restructure or reorganize its businesses.JPMorgan Chase is required under the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules to prepare and submit  periodically to those agencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly resolution in bankruptcy without extraordinary government support, in the event of material financial distress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of the Firm’s resolution plan may change, and the requirements for resolution plans may be modified from time to time. Any such determinations or modifications could result in JPMorgan Chase making changes to its legal entity structure or to certain internal or external activities that could increase funding or operational costs.If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to determine that a future resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan Chase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities or operations. After two years, if the deficiencies are not cured, the agencies could also require that JPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest assets or businesses in ways that could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and strategy. Holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if it were to enter into a resolution.Federal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “holding company”) maintain minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible LTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s operating subsidiaries if the holding company were to enter into a resolution either:•in a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or •in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).If the holding company were to enter into a resolution, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the holding company will absorb the losses of the holding company and its affiliates.The preferred “single point of entry” strategy under JPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that only the holding company would enter bankruptcy proceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be divested or wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, the holding company’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the holding company’s equity securities and thereafter on its unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of the holding company. Accordingly, in a resolution of the holding company in bankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of the holding company would realize value only to the 10  extent available to the holding company as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of the holding company have been fully repaid.The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as the holding company, under Title II. However, the FDIC has not, to date, formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy.If the holding company were to enter into a resolution, none of the holding company, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan Chase’s preferred strategy, and losses to holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the holding company, under whatever strategy is ultimately followed, could be greater.PoliticalPolitical developments can cause uncertainty concerning the regulatory environment in which JPMorgan Chase operates its businesses.Recent elections and referendums in the U.S. and abroad have introduced uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment in which JPMorgan Chase and other financial services firms will operate in the future. For example, the U.K.’s planned departure from the EU has engendered significant uncertainty concerning the regulatory framework under which global financial services institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, will need to conduct their business in the U.K. and the EU. Depending on the nature of the arrangements agreed between the U.K. and the EU, including with respect to the ability of financial services companies to engage in business in the EU from legal entities organized in or operating from the U.K., JPMorgan Chase may need to make significant changes to its legal entity structure and operations and the locations in which it operates. These types of structural and operational changes could result in JPMorgan Chase needing to implement an operating model across its European legal entities that is less efficient or cost-effective. The result of an election may suggest that the new administration will ease the regulatory requirements that apply to financial services firms. However, it is equally possible that the potential for reduced regulation does not occur or is reversed by another regulator or by a subsequent administration, or that deregulation measures that are ultimately enacted deliver significant competitive advantages to financial services firms that are structured differently or serve different markets than JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase cannot predict political developments of this nature, or whether they will have favorable or unfavorable long-term effects on its businesses.Economic uncertainty caused by political developments can hurt JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.The economic environment and market conditions in which JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain due to  recent political developments in the U.S. and abroad. Certain policy proposals, including isolationist foreign policies, protectionist trade policies or the possible withdrawal or reduction of government support for GSEs, could cause a contraction in U.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility in the financial markets. These types of political developments could, among other things:•erode investor confidence in the U.S. economy and financial markets•heighten concerns about whether the U.S. government will be funded, and its outstanding debt serviced, at any particular time, and •undermine the status of the U.S. dollar as a safe haven currency.These factors could lead to greater market volatility, large-scale sales of U.S. government debt and other U.S. debt and equity securities, the widening of credit spreads and other market dislocations. Any of these potential outcomes could cause JPMorgan Chase to suffer losses in its investment securities portfolio, reduce its capital levels, hamper its ability to deliver products and services to its clients and customers, and weaken its results of operations.Political developments in other parts of the world have also led to uncertainty in global economic conditions, including:•concerns about the capabilities and intentions of the government of North Korea, and•regional hostilities, and political or social upheavals, in other parts of the world.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be adversely affected by the uncertainty arising from significant political developments and any market volatility or disruption that results from that uncertainty.The positive impact of U.S. tax reform legislation on JPMorgan Chase may diminish over time. The long-term impact of the tax reform legislation recently enacted in the U.S. on JPMorgan Chase and the U.S. economy is not yet known. While the tax reform will have a positive impact on JPMorgan Chase’s net income, the competitive environment and other factors will influence the extent to which these benefits are retained by JPMorgan Chase over the longer term. In addition, the specific impact on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, products and geographies may vary.MarketJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations can be negatively affected by adverse changes in any of the following:•the liquidity in the U.S. and global financial markets•the level and volatility of market prices and rates, including those for debt and equity instruments,   11Part Icurrencies, commodities, interest rates and other market indices•investor, consumer and business sentiment•events that reduce confidence in the financial markets•inflation and unemployment•the availability and cost of capital and credit•the economic effects of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, health emergencies or pandemics, cyberattacks, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities•monetary and fiscal policies and actions taken by governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve and other central banks, and •the health of the U.S. and global economies.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including:•U.S. interest rates•the rate of unemployment•housing prices•the level of consumer confidence•changes in consumer spending, and•the number of personal bankruptcies.Sustained low growth in the U.S. economy could diminish customer demand for the products and services offered by JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses. It could also increase the cost to provide those products and services. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to an increase in delinquencies in mortgage, credit card, auto and other loans and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These consequences could be significantly worse in certain geographies where high levels of unemployment have resulted from declining industrial or manufacturing activity. JPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by changes in government policies that affect consumers, including those relating to medical insurance, immigration and employment status, as well as governmental policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in, among other things, higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income.In JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients and, therefore, the revenue that JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions. These factors can also influence the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in capital markets transactions that JPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings. Furthermore, if a significant and sustained  deterioration in market conditions were to occur, the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses could be reduced to the extent that those businesses:•earn less fee revenue due to lower transaction volumes, including when clients are unwilling or unable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations in unfavorable market conditions•dispose of portions of credit commitments, such as loan syndications or securities underwritings, at a loss, or•hold larger residual positions in credit commitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio and market-making positions can suffer losses due to adverse economic, market and political events and conditions.JPMorgan Chase generally maintains positions in various fixed income instruments in its investment securities portfolio, and positions in various fixed income, currency, commodity, credit and equity instruments as part of its market-making activities. Market-making positions are intended to facilitate demand from JPMorgan Chase’s clients for these instruments and to provide liquidity for clients. The value of the positions that JPMorgan Chase holds can be significantly affected by factors such as: •JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively hedge market and other risks on its positions•volatility in interest rates and debt, equity and commodities markets•changes in interest rates and credit spreads, and•the availability of liquidity in the capital markets.All of these are affected by global economic, market and political events and conditions, as well as regulatory restrictions on market-making activities.JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio and market-making businesses can also suffer losses due to unanticipated market events, including:•severe declines in asset values•unexpected credit events•unforeseen events or conditions that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa), or•other market risks that may not have been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument.If JPMorgan Chase experiences significant losses in its investment securities portfolio or from market-making activities, this could reduce JPMorgan Chase’s profitability and its capital levels, and thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.12  JPMorgan Chase’s asset and wealth management and custody businesses may earn lower fee revenue during adverse macroeconomic conditions.The fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing third-party assets or holding assets in custody for clients could be diminished by declining asset values or other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For example, higher interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Similarly, adverse macroeconomic or market conditions could prompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts, or cause clients to invest in products that generate lower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals from a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the investment performance of the fund, particularly if the outflows create the need for the fund to dispose of fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and could lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker investment performance.Changes in interest rates and credit spreads can adversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue and income streams. JPMorgan Chase can generally be expected to earn higher net interest income when interest rates are high or increasing. However, higher interest rates can also lead to:•fewer originations of commercial and residential loans•lower returns on JPMorgan Chase’s investment securities portfolio, and•the loss of deposits to the extent that JPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about depositor behavior.All of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s revenues and capital levels. Higher interest rates can also negatively affect the payment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s consumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked to variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable rate loans are unable to afford higher interest payments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making payments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur losses and increased operational costs related to servicing a higher volume of delinquent loans. On the other hand, a low interest rate environment may cause JPMorgan Chase’s net interest margins to be compressed, which could reduce:•the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its investment securities portfolio to the extent that it is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding instruments, and•the value of JPMorgan Chase’s mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby reducing its net interest income and other revenues.When credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive for JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads  may widen or narrow not only in response to events and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan Chase but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in JPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect, positively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on certain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are recorded at fair value. High market volatility can impact JPMorgan Chase’s markets businesses.While JPMorgan Chase’s markets businesses may earn higher flow revenue during periods of elevated market volatility, sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities, loans, derivatives and other instruments can:•curtail the trading markets for those instruments•make it difficult to sell or hedge those instruments•increase JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs, or•adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, capital or liquidity.The Federal Reserve has observed that market volatility may be exacerbated by regulatory restrictions. It noted that market participants that are subject to the Volcker Rule are likely to decrease their market-making activities, and thereby constrain market liquidity, during periods of market stress. Furthermore, market participants that are not required to hold substantial amounts of capital may retreat more quickly from volatile markets, which could further reduce market liquidity. In a difficult or less liquid market environment, JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies. In these circumstances, it may be difficult for JPMorgan Chase to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of other market participants or widespread market dislocations. Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues.CreditJPMorgan Chase can be adversely affected by the financial condition of its clients, customers and counterparties.JPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan Chase to the credit risk of its clients and counterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in disputes and litigation in the event that a client or counterparty defaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses or liability where a financial institution that it has appointed to   13Part Iprovide custody services for assets of JPMorgan Chase’s clients becomes insolvent.Disputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives contracts with regard to the terms, the settlement procedures or the value of underlying collateral. The disposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan Chase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and legal costs, or result in credit losses. These consequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to effectively manage its credit risk exposure from its market activities.JPMorgan Chase’s markets businesses can be harmed by the insolvency of a significant market participant.The failure of a significant market participant, or concerns about the creditworthiness of such a firm, can have a cascading effect within the financial markets. JPMorgan Chase’s markets businesses could be significantly disrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads to other market participants incurring significant losses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting.JPMorgan Chase’s clearing services business is exposed to the risk of client or counterparty default.As part of its clearing services activities, JPMorgan Chase is a member of various central counterparty clearinghouses (“CCPs”). In the event that another member of such an organization defaults on its obligations to the CCP, JPMorgan Chase may be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the CCP as a result of that default. As a clearing member, JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate collateral. JPMorgan Chase is exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to those clients. If a client for which JPMorgan Chase provides these services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase may incur losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject to regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing events can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and litigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses to the extent that any collateral that it has received is insufficient to cover those losses.JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of collateral declines in stressed market conditions.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, JPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased when JPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to it. Furthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning the valuation of collateral may increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or to manage declines in the value of collateral. JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising from concentrations of credit and market risk.JPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market risk to the extent that groupings of its clients or counterparties:•engage in similar businesses•do business in the same geographic region, or•have business profiles, models or strategies that could cause their ability to meet their obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries. This type of interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s credit and market risk exposure and potentially cause it to incur losses, including fair value losses in its trading businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions that affect a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or counterparties not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located. These conditions could also heighten concerns about the ability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses who live in those areas or work in those affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit and market risk exposures to assess the potential risks of concentration or contagion, but its efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against those risks may not be successful.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be harmed by an excessive, industry-wide expansion of consumer credit. For example, heightened competition among financial institutions for certain types of consumer loans, including credit card, mortgage, auto or other loans, could prompt significant reductions in the pricing of those loans and thereby decrease their profitability, or result in loans being extended to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large numbers of consumers subsequently default on their loans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an economic downturn or other factors, this could impair their ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan Chase and result in higher charge-offs and other credit-related losses. More broadly, widespread defaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary conditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an environment.Disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets could cause JPMorgan Chase to be unable to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions in various debt instruments, loans, derivatives and other obligations, and thereby lead to increased risk concentrations. If JPMorgan 14  Chase is unable to reduce positions effectively during a market dislocation, this can increase both the market and credit risks associated with those positions and the level of risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) that JPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These factors could increase JPMorgan Chase’s capital requirements and funding costs and adversely affect the profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.LiquidityLiquidity is critical to JPMorgan Chase’s ability to fund and operate its businesses. JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any given time by factors such as:•market-wide illiquidity or disruption•unforeseen cash or capital requirements•inability to sell assets, or to sell assets at favorable times or prices•default by a CCP or other significant market participant•unanticipated outflows of cash or collateral, and•lack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan Chase or financial institutions in general. A diminution of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be caused by events over which it has little or no control. For example, during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, periods of low investor confidence and significant market illiquidity resulted in higher funding costs for JPMorgan Chase and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity, including securitized debt issuances. There is no assurance that severe conditions of this type will not occur in the future.JPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from alternative sources if its access to stable and lower-cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits and borrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced. Alternative sources of funding could be more expensive or limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding costs could also be negatively affected by actions that JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:•satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements•continue to satisfy requirements under the TLAC rules concerning the amount of eligible LTD that JPMorgan Chase must have outstanding•address obligations under its resolution plan, or•satisfy regulatory requirements in countries outside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.More generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively manage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability to fund or invest in its businesses, and thereby adversely affect its results of operations. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments on its outstanding securities.JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds the stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to the holding company. The holding company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from securities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock).The ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC to make payments to the holding company is also limited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, as well as capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the holding company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of Directors. As a result of these arrangements, the ability of the holding company to make various payments is dependent on its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. These limitations could affect the holding company’s ability to:•pay interest on its debt securities•pay dividends on its equity securities•redeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and•fulfill its other payment obligations.Collectively, these regulatory restrictions and limitations could significantly limit the holding company’s ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. They could also result in the holding company seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would have been the case absent the existence of those thresholds.Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including:•economic and geopolitical trends •regulatory developments •expected future profitability   15Part I•risk management practices•legal expenses•assumptions about government support, and •ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries.JPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the extent that it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings. However, there is no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade could occur at times of broader market instability when JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.A reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could curtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and reduce its profitability in a number of ways, including by:•reducing access to capital markets •materially increasing the cost of issuing and servicing securities •triggering additional collateral or funding requirements, and •decreasing the number of investors and counterparties that are willing or permitted to do business with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.Any rating reduction could also increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This could, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries.Regulation and reform of benchmarks could have adverse consequences on securities and other instruments that are linked to those benchmarks.Interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of recent international, national and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be fully anticipated. Any of the international, national or other proposals for reform or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks could also increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of benchmarks and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the effect of discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks or lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks. On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021, and it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021.Any of the these developments, and any future initiatives to regulate, reform or change the manner of administration of benchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for securities and other instruments whose returns are linked to any such benchmark, including those issued by JPMorgan Chase or its subsidiaries.OperationalJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly dependent on the effectiveness of its operational systems and those of other market participants.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely comprehensively on the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, trading, data processing and other operational systems to process, record, monitor and report a large number of transactions on a continuous basis, and to do so accurately and quickly. In addition to proper design, installation, maintenance and training, the effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems depends on, among other things:•the quality of the information contained in those systems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can significantly compromise the functionality of a particular operational system and other systems to which it transmits information, and•JPMorgan Chase’s ability to appropriately maintain and upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to ensure that any changes introduced to its systems are managed carefully to ensure operational continuity.JPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access and use the operational systems of its vendors, custodians and other market participants, including clearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities exchanges and data processing, security and technology companies. The ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of the operational systems of JPMorgan Chase or another significant market participant, including due to a cyberbreach, could result in unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets and for JPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers, including:•delays or other disruptions in providing information, services and liquidity to clients and customers•the inability to settle transactions or obtain access to funds and other assets16  •the possibility that transactions such as funds transfers or capital markets trades are executed erroneously, illegally or with unintended consequences•financial losses, including possible restitution to clients and customers•higher operational costs associated with replacing services provided by a system that is unavailable•customer dissatisfaction and loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s products and services, and•harm to reputation.Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities exchanges, clearing houses and other financial market infrastructures, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to conduct business.As the speed, frequency, volume and complexity of transactions increases, it becomes more challenging to effectively maintain JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and infrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks that:•errors, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause widespread system disruption•isolated or seemingly insignificant errors in operational systems compound, or migrate to other systems over time, to become larger issues•failures in synchronization or encryption software, or degraded performance of microprocessors due to design flaws, causes disruptions in operational systems, or the inability of systems to communicate with each other, and•third parties attempt to block the use of key technology solutions by claiming that the use infringes on their intellectual property rights.If JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of third parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses depend, are unable to meet the demanding standards of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase relies on the skill and integrity of its employees and those of third parties in running its operational systems.The effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems also depends on the competence and reliability of its employees, as well as the employees of third parties on whom JPMorgan Chase depends for technological support, security or other services. JPMorgan Chase could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure caused by human error or  misconduct by an employee of JPMorgan Chase or a third party. JPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails to identify and address operational risks associated with new products or processes.When JPMorgan Chase changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions, JPMorgan Chase may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from those changes, or may fail to implement adequate controls to mitigate the risks associated with new business activities. Any of these occurrences could diminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses or result in:•potential liability to clients and customers•increased operating expenses•higher litigation costs, including regulatory fines, penalties and other sanctions•damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation•impairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity•regulatory intervention, or •weaker competitive standing.Any of the foregoing consequences could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s connections to third-party operational systems expose it to greater operational risks.Third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business, as well as retailers, data aggregators and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase. This is particularly the case where activities of customers or those third parties are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems, including through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. If a third party obtains access to customer account data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that third party experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or misappropriates that data, this could result in a variety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and its customers, including:•heightened risk that third parties will be able to execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan Chase’s systems•losses from fraudulent transactions, as well as potential liability for losses that exceed thresholds established in consumer protection laws and regulations•increased operational costs to remediate the consequences of the third party’s security breach, and•harm to reputation arising from the perception that JPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.  17Part IAs JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with customers and other third parties expands, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems. Security breaches affecting JPMorgan Chase’s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting those other third parties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information. These actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction. JPMorgan Chase faces substantial legal and operational risks in safeguarding personal information.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected parties can include:•JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers•clients and customers of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers•JPMorgan Chase’s employees, and•employees of JPMorgan Chase’s suppliers, counterparties and other third parties.Ensuring that JPMorgan Chase’s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information comply with all applicable laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can:•increase JPMorgan Chase’s operating costs•affect the development of new products or services•demand significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management, and •require JPMorgan Chase to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Furthermore, JPMorgan Chase cannot ensure that all of its clients and customers, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and JPMorgan Chase, particularly where information is transmitted by electronic means. JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused, such as situations where such information is:•erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or•intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties.Concerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause  JPMorgan Chase to lose existing or potential clients and customers, and thereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore, any failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, significant liabilities or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of these could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s operations and results could be vulnerable to catastrophes or other events that disrupt its business.JPMorgan Chase’s business and operational systems could be seriously disrupted by events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, including:•cyberbreaches or breaches of physical premises•electrical or telecommunications outages•failures of, or loss of access to, operational systems, including computer systems, servers, networks and other technology assets•damage to or loss of property or assets•natural disasters or severe weather conditions•health emergencies or pandemics, or •events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure the ability to recover critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers. Any significant failure or disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations or operational systems could, among other things:•hinder its ability to provide services to its clients and customers•require it to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption•cause it to incur financial losses, both from loss of revenue and damage to or loss of property, and•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions.A successful cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase could cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.JPMorgan Chase experiences numerous cyberattacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets on a daily basis. These cyberattacks can 18  take many forms, but a common objective of many of these attacks is to introduce computer viruses or malware into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These viruses or malicious code are typically designed to, among other things:•obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers•manipulate or destroy data•disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or•steal money.JPMorgan Chase has also been the target of significant distributed denial-of-service attacks which are intended to disrupt online banking services.JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems to protect them against cyberattacks. However, JPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due to cyberattacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches will occur in the future. Any such breach could result in serious and harmful consequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and customers.A principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide absolute security against cyberattacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches. This is because, among other things:•the techniques used in cyberattacks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched•cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments, and•third parties may seek to gain access to JPMorgan Chase’s systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of JPMorgan Chase’s systems.The risk of a security breach due to a cyberattack could increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase continues to expand its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of web-based products and applications.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of a supplier, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including:•significant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems •misappropriation of confidential information of JPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers, counterparties or employees•damage to computers or systems of JPMorgan Chase and those of its clients, customers and counterparties•inability to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions•violations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy and other laws•financial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients and customers•loss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity measures•client and customer dissatisfaction•significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase could also suffer some of the above consequences if a third party were to misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.JPMorgan Chase may not be able to immediately address the consequences of a security breach due to a cyberattack.A successful breach of JPMorgan Chase’s computer systems, software, networks or other technology assets due to a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected due to, among other things:•the breadth of JPMorgan Chase’s operations and the high volume of transactions that it processes•the large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which JPMorgan Chase does business•the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, and•the possibility that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems.The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could   19Part Ifurther increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework and procedures may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework is intended to mitigate risk and loss. JPMorgan Chase has established processes and procedures to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which JPMorgan Chase is subject. However, there are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may be existing or future risks that JPMorgan Chase has not appropriately anticipated or identified.JPMorgan Chase could be exposed to unexpected losses, and JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, by any inadequacy or lapse in its risk management framework, governance structure, procedures and practices, models or reporting systems. An inadequacy or lapse could:•require significant resources to remediate•attract heightened regulatory scrutiny•expose JPMorgan Chase to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings•subject it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •diminish confidence in JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chase relies on data to assess its various risk exposures. Any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s data gathering and validation processes could result in ineffective risk management practices. These deficiencies could also result in inaccurate risk reporting.JPMorgan Chase establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposures. It then employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and financial condition. They require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. It is possible that JPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper factors or that it will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.  Many of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies and techniques consider historical market behavior.  These strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in  the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated.  Conversely, previously-correlated indicators may make unrelated movements at those times. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have, in some circumstances, limited the effectiveness of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing it to incur losses.JPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses and face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations are inadequate.JPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations to assess and implement mitigating controls over its market, credit, operational and other risks. These models and estimations are based on a variety of assumptions and historical trends, and are periodically reviewed and modified as necessary. The models and estimations that JPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases to observe and mitigate risk due to a variety of factors, such as:•reliance on historical trends that may not accurately predict future events, including assumptions underlying the models and estimations which predict correlation among certain market indicators or asset prices•inherent limitations associated with forecasting uncertain economic and financial outcomes•historical trend information may be incomplete, or may not anticipate severely negative market conditions such as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of liquidity•technology that is introduced to run models or estimations may not perform as expected, or may not be well understood by the personnel using the technology•models and estimations may contain erroneous data, valuations, formulas or algorithms, and•review processes may fail to detect flaws in models and estimations.JPMorgan Chase could incur substantial losses, its capital levels could be reduced and it could face greater regulatory scrutiny if its models or estimations prove to be inadequate. Some of the models and other analytical and judgment-based estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing risks are subject to review by, and require the approval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These reviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use those models and estimations in connection with calculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan Chase’s models or estimations are not approved by its regulators, it may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit the ability to expand its businesses. JPMorgan Chase’s capital actions could also be constrained if a CCAR submission is not approved by its banking regulators due to the perceived inadequacy of its models or estimations.20  Enhanced standards for vendor risk management can result in higher costs and other potential exposures.JPMorgan Chase must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with doing business with vendors and other third-party service providers. These requirements are contained both in bank regulatory regulations and guidance and in certain consent orders to which JPMorgan Chase has been subject. JPMorgan Chase incurs significant costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. JPMorgan Chase’s failure to appropriately assess and manage third-party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. Specifically, any such failure could subject JPMorgan Chase to:•potential liability to clients and customers•regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•increased operational costs, or•harm to its reputation.Requirements for physical settlement and delivery in trading agreements could expose JPMorgan Chase to operational and other risks.Certain of JPMorgan Chase’s markets transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that JPMorgan Chase does not own. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to obtain the obligations within the required timeframe, JPMorgan Chase could forfeit payments otherwise due. Failures could also result in settlement delays, which could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and ability to transact business. Failure to timely settle and confirm transactions could also subject JPMorgan Chase to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, market and operational losses. JPMorgan Chase could incur unexpected losses if estimates and judgments underlying its financial statements are incorrect.Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain financial instruments require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements, including:•trading assets and liabilities•instruments in the investment securities portfolio•certain loans•MSRs•structured notes, and  •certain repurchase and resale agreements.Where quoted market prices are not available for these types of instruments, JPMorgan Chase may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. Sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which could lead to valuations being subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates or judgments underlying JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan Chase may experience material losses.Lapses in controls over disclosure or financial reporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance, or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies could:•materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and results of operations or financial condition•restrict its ability to access the capital markets •require it to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies•expose it to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions•harm its reputation, or •otherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan Chase.StrategicIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and execute effective business strategies, JPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results could suffer. JPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly affect its competitive standing and results of operations. These strategies relate to:•the products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers•the geographies in which it operates•the types of clients and customers that it serves•the counterparties with which it does business, and •the methods and distribution channels by which it offers products and services. The franchise values and growth prospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, and its earnings and results of operations, may suffer and revenues could decline if management makes choices about these strategies and goals that:•prove to be incorrect  21Part I•do not accurately assess the competitive landscape and industry trends, or •fail to address changing regulatory and market environments in the U.S. and abroad.JPMorgan Chase’s growth and prospects also depend on management’s ability to develop and execute effective business plans to address these strategic priorities, both in the near term and over longer time horizons. Management’s effectiveness in this regard will affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to develop and enhance its resources, control expenses and return capital to shareholders. Each of these objectives could be adversely affected by management’s failure to:•devise effective business plans and strategies•effectively implement business decisions, including by minimizing bureaucratic processes•institute controls that appropriately address the risks associated with business activities and any changes in those activities•offer products and services that meet the expectations of clients and customers, and in ways that enhance their satisfaction with those products and services•allocate capital to JPMorgan Chase’s businesses in a manner that promotes their long-term profitability•adequately respond to regulatory requirements•appropriately address shareholder concerns•react quickly to changes in market conditions or market structures, or•develop and enhance the operational, technology, risk, financial and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Additionally, JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors plays an important role in exercising appropriate oversight of management’s strategic decisions, and a failure by the Board to perform this function could also impair JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations. ConductMisconduct by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm its clients and customers, damage its reputation and trigger litigation and regulatory action.JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties, and with each other, every day. All employees are expected to demonstrate values and exhibit the culture and behaviors that are an integral part of JPMorgan Chase’s How We Do Business Principles, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way.” JPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed culture and conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management. Culture and conduct risk management are  also important to JPMorgan Chase’s promotion and compensation processes.Notwithstanding these expectations, policies and practices, certain employees have in the past engaged in improper or illegal conduct resulting in litigation as well as settlements involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, as well as other civil and criminal settlements with regulators and other governmental entities. There is no assurance that further inappropriate actions by employees will not occur or that any such actions will always be deterred or quickly prevented.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and collateral consequences could result, from a failure by one or more employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations, including by acting in ways that harm clients, customers, other market participants or other employees. Some examples of this include:•improperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s products or services•engaging in insider trading, market manipulation or unauthorized trading•facilitating illegal or aggressive tax-motivated transactions, or transactions designed to circumvent economic sanction programs•failing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other duties owed to clients or customers•violating anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding with other market participants to manipulate markets, prices or indices•making risk decisions in ways that subordinate JPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to employee compensation objectives, and•misappropriating property or confidential or proprietary information or technology belonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers or third parties.The consequences of any failure by employees to act consistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations could include litigation, or regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions. Any of these proceedings or actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other sanctions, or lead to:•financial losses•increased operational and compliance costs•greater regulatory scrutiny•requirements that JPMorgan Chase restructure, curtail or cease certain of its activities•the need for significant oversight by JPMorgan Chase’s management•the undermining of JPMorgan Chase’s culture22  •loss of clients or customers, and•harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.ReputationDamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could harm its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees. Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to JPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects. Harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including:•employee misconduct•security breaches•compliance failures•litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, or •regulatory investigations, enforcement actions or settlements.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of certain third parties to comply with laws or regulations, including companies in which JPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties to joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors and other third parties with which JPMorgan Chase does business.JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels.Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect JPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by a financial institution, or that a financial institution has acted inappropriately with respect to the methods used to offer products to customers, can damage the reputation of the industry as a whole. If JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in these types of behaviors, the measures needed to address the associated reputational issues could increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and compliance costs and negatively affect its earnings. Furthermore, events that undermine JPMorgan Chase’s reputation can hinder its ability to attract and retain clients, customers, investors and employees.Failure to effectively manage potential conflicts of interest can result in litigation and enforcement actions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as its business activities encompass more transactions, obligations and  interests with and among JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan Chase can become subject to litigation and enforcement actions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the failure or perceived failure to, among other things:•adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest•deliver appropriate standards of service and quality•treat clients and customers fairly•use client and customer data responsibly and in a manner that meets legal requirements and regulatory expectations•provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or •handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations. In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately address conflicts or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.CountryJPMorgan Chase can incur losses due to unfavorable economic developments around the world.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the monetary, fiscal and other policies adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. For example, the Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in fiscal policies by central banks or regulatory authorities, and the manner in which those policies are executed, are beyond JPMorgan Chase’s control and may be difficult to predict. Consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies or the ways in which they are implemented could have a negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and revenues are also subject to the risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others:•negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions•the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which those companies operate, and•the other risks and considerations discussed below.  23Part IAdverse economic and political developments in a country or region can have a wider negative impact on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.Some countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase operates or invests, or in which JPMorgan Chase may do business in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced commercial activity among trading partners within the affected countries or region. These developments can also create market volatility which can lead to a contagion affecting other countries in the same region or beyond. Furthermore, governments in particular countries or regions in which JPMorgan Chase or its clients do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions. Any or all of these developments could lead to diminished cross-border trade and financing activity within that country or region, all of which could negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s business and earnings in those jurisdictions. If JPMorgan Chase takes steps to reduce its market and credit risk exposure within a particular country or region that is experiencing economic or political disruption, it may incur losses that are higher than expected because it will be disposing of assets when market conditions are likely to be highly unfavorable.JPMorgan Chase’s business activities with governmental entities pose a greater risk of loss.Several of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities, both within and outside the U.S. These activities can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may:•default on or restructure its obligations•claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, or•repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government.Any or all of these actions could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and results of operations and could hurt its reputation, particularly if JPMorgan Chase pursues claims against a government obligor in a jurisdiction in which it has significant business relationships with clients or customers.JPMorgan Chase’s business and revenues in emerging markets can be hampered by local political, social and economic factors.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts business have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable,  than the U.S. and other developed markets in which JPMorgan Chase operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including:•extreme currency fluctuations•high inflation•low or negative growth, or •defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt.The governments in these countries have sometimes reacted to these developments by imposing restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have been susceptible to unfavorable social developments arising from poor economic conditions and related governmental actions, including: •social unrest•general strikes and demonstrations•crime and corruption•security and personal safety issues•outbreaks of hostilities•overthrow of incumbent governments•terrorist attacks, or •other forms of internal discord. These economic, political and social developments have in the past resulted in, and in the future could lead to, conditions that can adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in those countries and impair the revenues, growth and profitability of those operations.If the legal and regulatory system in a particular country is less established or predictable, this can create a more difficult environment in which to conduct business. For example, any of the following could hamper JPMorgan Chase’s operations and reduce its earnings in countries with less established or predictable legal and regulatory regimes:•the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions•the adoption of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations•uncertainty concerning the enforceability of contractual obligations•difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive, and 24  •the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.JPMorgan Chase’s operations in or involving emerging markets countries can also be affected by governmental actions such as:•monetary policies•expropriation, nationalization or confiscation of assets•price, capital or exchange controls, and •changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these actions could be accentuated in trading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than more-developed markets. These types of government actions can negatively affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the relevant country, either directly or by suppressing the business activities of local clients or multi-national clients that conduct business in the jurisdiction. For example, some or all of these governmental actions can result in funds belonging to JPMorgan Chase, or that it places with a local custodian on behalf of a client, being effectively trapped in a country. In addition to the ultimate risk of losing the funds entirely, JPMorgan Chase could be exposed for an extended period of time to the credit risk of a local custodian that is now operating in a deteriorating domestic economy. JPMorgan Chase’s revenues from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations can be negatively affected by the foregoing economic, political and social conditions in a particular country in which it does business. In addition, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase’s operations in the emerging markets can subject it to higher operational and compliance costs.Conducting business in countries with less-developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires JPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that JPMorgan Chase will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. Complying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and compliance costs and risks. JPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar national and multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations throughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher costs and face greater compliance risks in structuring and operating its businesses to comply with these requirements. Furthermore, a violation of a sanction or embargo program or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering laws and regulations could subject JPMorgan Chase, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.CompetitionThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations will suffer if it is not a strong and effective competitor.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors include:•other banks and financial institutions•trading, advisory and investment management firms•finance companies and technology companies, and•other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services.JPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.New competitors have emerged. For example, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products. These advances have also allowed financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payment processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both financial institutions and their non-banking competitors face the risk that payment processing and other services could be disrupted by technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require no intermediation. New technologies have required and could require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain clients and customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. Ongoing or increased competition may put downward pressure on prices and fees for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services or may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share. This competition may be on the basis of, among other factors, quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. The failure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to   25Part Imeet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract or retain clients and customers. Any such impact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Increased competition also may require JPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.Non-U.S. competitors of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses outside the U.S. are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial services institutions can put JPMorgan Chase and those firms at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors. This could reduce the revenue and profitability of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, resulting from: •prohibitions on engaging in certain transactions •higher capital and liquidity requirements•making JPMorgan Chase’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients, and•adversely affecting JPMorgan Chase’s cost structure for providing certain products.PeopleJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.Changes in immigration policies could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase. There is the potential for changes in immigration policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including in the U.S. If immigration policies were to unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations or conducts its business, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected. LegalJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from private actions and formal and informal regulatory investigations.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan Chase may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to JPMorgan Chase. Any of these matters could materially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations.Regulators and other government agencies conduct examinations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries both on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened regulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an investigation or examination, may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. There is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.If another financial institution violates a law or regulation relating to a particular business activity or practice, this will often give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar activity or practice by JPMorgan Chase. These and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or require JPMorgan Chase to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services. All of these potential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences"
5,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2017-02-28,"Risk Factors
.The following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.Regulatory RiskJPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the Firm is subject.As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The financial services industry has in recent years experienced an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, both in the U.S. and globally. The cumulative effect of the new and currently proposed legislation and regulations could require the Firm to make further changes to its businesses or operations, which could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm and impose additional compliance and other costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firm’s profitability. These changes could also: limit the products and services that the Firm offers; reduce the liquidity that the Firm is able to offer its clients or counterparties through its market-making activities; impede the Firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging; require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain 8  businesses; affect the value of assets that the Firm holds; require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products; or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s businesses. To the extent that these initiatives have been, or continue to be, imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), the requirements to which the Firm may be subject under such laws and regulations could require the Firm to restructure further its businesses, or further re-price or curtail the products or services that it offers to customers, which could result in the Firm not being able to compete effectively with other institutions that are not impacted in the same way.Authorities in some non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Firm has operations have enacted legislation or regulations requiring that certain subsidiaries of the Firm operating in those countries maintain independent capital and liquidity. In addition, some non-U.S. regulators have proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that seek to impose restrictions on the way the Firm organizes its business units or increase the capital or liquidity requirements on non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm, could hinder the Firm’s ability to efficiently manage its operations, increase its funding and liquidity costs and  thereby decrease the Firm’s net income. In addition, there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, recent legislative and regulatory initiatives within the EU, including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions, the establishment by non-EU financial institutions of intermediate holding companies in the EU, the separation of trading activities from core banking services, mandatory on-exchange trading, position limits and reporting rules for derivatives, governance and accountability regimes, conduct of business requirements and restrictions on compensation, could require the Firm to make significant modifications to its non-U.S. business, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements. These differences in implemented or proposed non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could subject the Firm to increased compliance and legal costs, as well as higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations and profitability.Recent political developments in the U.S. and abroad have increased the uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment in which the Firm will operate. Although certain of the proposals being mentioned in the U.S. include the possibility of regulatory reform related to the financial services industry, it is too early to determine the full extent to which these measures will ultimately modify or reduce the regulatory requirements currently imposed on the Firm, and the resulting possible effect on the Firm and its business and operations. In addition, the U.K.’s planned  departure from the EU has engendered significant uncertainty concerning the regulatory framework under which global financial services institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, will need to conduct their business and operations in the EU after the U.K.’s departure.Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may continue to increase the Firm’s costs and risks.The Firm’s businesses and operations are subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny. The Firm has paid significant fines (or has provided significant monetary and other relief) to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies. The Firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject, which increases the Firm’s operational and compliance costs.Certain regulators have taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions against financial institutions (including the Firm) that require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters. Such admissions and conditions can lead to, among other things, greater exposure in civil litigation, harm to reputation, disqualification from providing business to certain clients and in certain jurisdictions, and other direct and indirect adverse effects.In addition, U.S. government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions, including the Firm, and have increasingly sought, and obtained, resolutions that include criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing from those institutions, such as the Firm’s agreement in May 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities, and the non-prosecution agreement entered into by a subsidiary of the Firm with the U.S. Department of Justice in November 2016 in connection with settlements to resolve various governmental investigations relating to a former hiring program for candidates referred by clients, potential clients and government officials in the Asia Pacific region. Such resolutions, whether with U.S. or non-U.S. authorities, could have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution, including loss of customers and business, or the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, for a period of time (absent the forbearance of, or the granting of waivers by, applicable regulators).The Firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than with informal supervisory action. In addition, if the Firm fails to meet the requirements of the various governmental settlements to which it is subject, or more   9Part Igenerally, to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses. The extent of the Firm’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the Firm has established for such matters.Requirements for the orderly resolution of the Firm could require JPMorgan Chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses.Under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title I”) and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules, the Firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a detailed plan (the “Resolution Plan”) for the rapid and orderly resolution, without extraordinary government support, of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its subsidiaries under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress of the Firm.  In April 2016, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly provided firm-specific feedback on the 2015 Resolution Plans of eight systemically important domestic banking institutions, and determined that five of these 2015 Resolution Plans, including that of the Firm, were not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In addition to the identified deficiencies, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC also identified certain shortcomings which were required to be satisfactorily addressed in the Firm’s Resolution Plan due on July 1, 2017. On October 1, 2016, the Firm filed with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its submission (the “2016 Resolution Submission”) describing how the Firm remediated the identified deficiencies and providing a status report of its actions to address the identified shortcomings.  On December 13, 2016, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC advised the Firm of their determinations that the Firm’s 2016 Resolution Submission adequately remediated the deficiencies in the Firm’s 2015 Resolution Plan identified by the agencies. On July 1, 2017, the Firm will file with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its 2017 Resolution Plan which will, among other things, describe how the Firm has remediated the remaining shortcomings identified by the agencies in April 2016. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that the Firm did not remediate the identified shortcomings, or that the Firm’s 2017 Resolution Plan, or any future update of that plan, is not credible, and the Firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the Firm or restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the Firm, and could, if such deficiencies are not remedied within two years after such a determination, require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest businesses, legal entities, operational systems and/or intercompany transactions in ways that could  materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations and strategy. In addition, in order to continue to maintain a Title I Resolution Plan that the Federal Reserve and FDIC determine is credible, the Firm may need to make additional changes to its legal entity structure and to certain intercompany and external activities, which could result in increased funding or operational costs.Holders of JPMorgan Chase’s debt and equity securities will absorb losses if JPMorgan Chase were to enter into a resolution.The Federal Reserve has issued final rules (the “TLAC rules”) regarding the minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity that bank holding companies are required to have issued and outstanding, as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments, to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalizing the Firm’s operating subsidiaries (“eligible LTD”). If JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to enter into a resolution, either in a proceeding under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Firm will absorb the losses of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates. Under the Firm’s Resolution Plan, the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy contemplates that only JPMorgan Chase & Co. would enter bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code pursuant to a “single point of entry” recapitalization strategy. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s subsidiaries would be recapitalized as needed so that they could continue normal operations or subsequently be wound down in an orderly manner. As a result, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s losses and any losses incurred by its subsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s equity securities and thereafter on unsecured creditors, including holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s eligible LTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of those debt securities would have a junior position to the claims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s subsidiaries and to the claims of priority (as determined by statute) and secured creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Accordingly, in a resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. would realize value only to the extent available to JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, and only after any claims of priority and secured creditors of JPMorgan Chase & Co. have been fully repaid. If JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to enter into a resolution, none of JPMorgan Chase & Co., the Federal Reserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy under its Resolution Plan.The FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point of entry recapitalization model could be a desirable strategy to resolve a systemically important financial institution, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. Pursuant to that strategy, the FDIC would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for JPMorgan Chase & Co.; 10  transfer the systemically important and viable parts of its business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity; recapitalize those subsidiaries using assets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. that have been transferred to the bridge entity; and exchange external debt claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. for equity in the bridge entity. Under this Title II resolution strategy, the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of eligible LTD and other debt securities of JPMorgan Chase & Co. may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such securities. To date, the FDIC has not formally adopted a single point of entry resolution strategy and it is not obligated to follow such a strategy in a Title II resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co.Market RiskJPMorgan Chase’s results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and global financial market and economic conditions and political developments.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates, currency and commodities prices (including oil prices) and other market indices; investor, consumer and business sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, health emergencies or pandemics, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities; monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks; and the health of the U.S. and global economies. Recent political developments in the U.S. and abroad have increased the uncertainty regarding the economic environment in which the Firm will operate. Although certain of the proposals being considered in the U.S., such as tax reform or increased expenditure on infrastructure projects, could lead to higher levels of U.S. economic activity and more expansive U.S. domestic economic growth, others, such as protectionist trade policies or isolationist foreign policies, could contract economic growth. The uncertainty around the manner and extent to which these economic policies are ultimately enacted could impact market volatility and affect the Firm’s businesses, both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the Firm’s clients and customers. In addition, the effects of various referenda in Europe, including the vote by the U.K. electorate to leave the EU, as well as the uncertainties regarding the outcome of Eurozone presidential elections in 2017, have triggered political and economic uncertainty in the Eurozone. There is no assurance that such uncertainty, and any resultant market volatility, will not adversely affect the Firm’s results of operations.In the Firm’s wholesale businesses, market and economic factors can affect the volume of transactions that the Firm  executes for its clients and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives, as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm.The Firm generally maintains market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities, credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; interest rate and credit spreads; and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions, political events and regulatory restrictions on market-making activities. In addition, the Firm’s market-making businesses can expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not having been appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument. The Firm may be adversely affected by declining asset values. This is particularly true for businesses that earn fees for managing third-party assets or receive or post collateral. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firm’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount of assets under management or custody. Macroeconomic or market concerns, as well as legislative and regulatory developments (such as, for example, the recently-adopted SEC rules relating to money-market funds), may also prompt outflows from the Firm’s funds or accounts or cause clients to invest funds in products that generate lower revenue.Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. An increasing or high interest rate environment, while generally increasing the net interest income earned by the Firm, may under certain circumstances also result in lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the investment securities portfolio (to the extent that the Firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding assets), thereby adversely affecting the Firm’s revenues and capital levels. Conversely, a low interest rate environment may compress net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby reducing the Firm’s net interest income and other revenues. The Firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest   11Part Irates, the rate of unemployment, housing prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies. Sustained low growth in the U.S. economy could diminish demand for the products and services offered by the Firm’s consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as economic dislocations in certain geographies due to high levels of unemployment resulting from declining industrial or manufacturing activity, or other market or economic factors, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card, auto, student and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firm’s earnings. The Firm’s earnings from its consumer businesses could also be adversely affected by changes in government policies that affect consumers, including those relating to medical insurance, immigration, employment status and taxation, as well as governmental policies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as infrastructure spending and global trade, which could result in, among other things, higher inflation or reductions in consumer disposable income.Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis, and may adversely affect the credit markets and the Firm’s businesses. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firm’s credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firm’s earnings on certain liabilities that are recorded at fair value. Sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets (including loans and derivatives) may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets, make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets, adversely affect the Firm’s profitability, capital or liquidity, or increase the Firm’s funding costs. The Federal Reserve has recently observed that market volatility may be exacerbated by regulatory restrictions, as market participants that are subject to the Volcker Rule are likely to decrease their market-making activities, and thereby constrain market liquidity, during periods of market stress. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants or widespread market dislocations. Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and decreased revenue for the Firm. Credit RiskThe financial condition of JPMorgan Chase’s clients and counterparties, particularly other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm.The Firm routinely executes transactions with clients and counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other types of financial institutions. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to the credit risk of its counterparties and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. Disputes with counterparties may also arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts, including with respect to the value of underlying collateral, which could cause the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, operational, legal and litigation costs, or result in credit losses, all of which may impair the Firm’s ability to manage effectively its credit risk exposure from these products.The failure of a significant market participant, or concerns about a default by such an institution, could also lead to significant liquidity problems for, or losses or defaults by, other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect the Firm. In addition, in recent years the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the Firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding to manipulate markets, prices or indices, and there is no assurance that such allegations will not arise in the same or similar contexts in the future.As part of providing clearing services, the Firm is a member of a number of CCPs, and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. As a clearing member, the Firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. In addition, the Firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to such clients. If a client for which the Firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may suffer losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more CCPs, or the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. All of such events can increase the Firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the Firm is insufficient to cover such losses.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors concerning the valuation of collateral could increase in 12  times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and the Firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when clients or counterparties are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firm’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries and thereby could exacerbate the Firm’s credit risk exposure and potentially increase its losses, including mark-to-market losses in its trading businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions affecting a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of the Firm’s borrowers or counterparties, not only in that particular industry or geography but in related or dependent industries, wherever located, or about the ability of customers of the Firm’s consumer businesses living in such areas or working in such affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to the Firm. Although the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its exposures to assess potential concentration or contagion risks, the Firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against concentration risks may not be successful.In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firm’s inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but may also increase the level of risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) on the Firm’s balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firm’s businesses.Liquidity RiskIf JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (“SPEs”) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, default by a CCP or other counterparty, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and  resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future.If the Firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, is reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. In addition, the Firm’s cost of funding could be affected by actions that the Firm may take in order to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements, to lower its GSIB systemic risk score, to satisfy the amount of eligible LTD that the Firm must have outstanding under the TLAC rules, to address obligations under the Firm’s Resolution Plan or to satisfy regulatory requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal entities.JPMorgan Chase is a holding company and depends on the cash flows of its subsidiaries to fund payments of dividends on its equity securities, principal and interest payments on its debt securities and redemptions and repurchases of its outstanding securities.As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is dependent on the earnings of its subsidiaries to meet its payment obligations. Under the arrangements contemplated by the Firm’s Resolution Plan, JPMorgan Chase & Co. has established a new intermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”), and has contributed to the IHC the stock of substantially all of its direct subsidiaries (other than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.) as well as other assets and intercompany indebtedness owing to it. Under these arrangements, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received by it from securities issuances (including, without limitation, issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common stock). As a result of these arrangements, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s ability to pay interest on its debt securities and dividends on its equity securities, to redeem or repurchase its outstanding securities and to fulfill its other payment obligations is dependent on it receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to restrictions on its dividend distributions, capital adequacy and liquidity coverage requirements, and other regulatory restrictions on its ability to make payments to JPMorgan Chase & Co., and the IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to JPMorgan Chase & Co. if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the Firm’s management or Board of Directors. These regulatory restrictions and limitations on the payments that JPMorgan Chase & Co. is permitted to receive from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC could reduce or hinder its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations, or result in JPMorgan Chase & Co. seeking protection under bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than   13Part Iwould have been the case absent the existence of such thresholds. Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, legal expenses, assumptions surrounding government support, and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages, to the extent it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings, there is no assurance that the Firm’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future, or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the Firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.Furthermore, a reduction in the Firm’s credit ratings could reduce the Firm’s access to capital markets, materially increase the cost of issuing securities, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future.Legal RiskJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious harm to the Firm’s reputation. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations.In addition, and as noted above, the Firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the Firm and its subsidiaries on both a routine- and targeted-exam basis, and there is no assurance  that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the Firm in the future. A violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulators and other governmental agencies of the same or similar practices by the Firm. For example, various regulatory and governmental agencies have made inquiries to the Firm about its sales practices with retail customers, including, among other matters, the Firm’s incentive compensation structures related to such practices. In addition, a single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These and other initiatives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities and officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm the Firm’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firm’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences as discussed above.Other Business RisksAny significant failure by the Firm’s management to anticipate and respond quickly and appropriately to changes in the Firm’s operating environment or trends affecting the financial services industry, to make prudent decisions regarding the Firm’s strategy or to execute on that strategy could adversely affect the Firm’s competitive standing and its earnings and future results of operations. The Firm operates in many jurisdictions and offers a wide variety of products and services to its clients and customers. The Firm’s strategies concerning the products and services that it will offer, the geographies in which it will operate, the types of clients and customers that it will serve and the counterparties with which it will do business, and the methods and distribution channels by which it will offer its products and services, will all affect the Firm’s competitive standing and its results of operations. If the Firm’s management makes choices about the Firm’s business strategies and goals that later prove to have been incorrect, does not accurately assess the competitive landscape and the industry trends affecting the Firm or does not formulate effective business plans to address the Firm’s near- and longer-term strategic priorities, as well as the changing regulatory and market environments in which the Firm operates both in the U.S. and abroad, the franchise values and  growth prospects of the Firm’s businesses will suffer and revenues will decline. The prospects of the Firm will also depend on management’s ability to execute effectively against the Firm’s strategic plans and to manage the Firm’s resources to grow revenues, control expenses and return capital to the Firm’s shareholders. Any significant failure by the Firm’s Board of Directors to exercise appropriate oversight of management’s strategic decisions, or any significant failure by the Firm’s management to develop and execute on the Firm’s strategic plans and business initiatives, or the ineffectual 14  implementation of business decisions, the failure of the Firm’s products or services or dealings with customers to meet customer expectations, inadequate responses to regulatory requirements, the failure to react quickly to changes in market conditions or structure, or the failure to develop the necessary operational, technology, risk, financial, and managerial resources necessary to grow and manage the Firm and its various businesses could adversely affect the Firm’s competitive standing and negatively  affect the Firm’s earnings and future results of operations. JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the U.S. and around the world.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies, such as “pegging” the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others) are beyond the Firm’s control and may be difficult to predict, and consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the Firm’s activities and results of operations.The Firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions, or the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below.Several of the Firm’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations, claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials or repudiate transactions authorized by a previous incumbent government, any or all of which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations.Further, various countries or regions in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to “market contagion” affecting other countries in the same region or beyond the  region. In addition, governments in particular countries or regions in which the Firm or its client do business may choose to adopt protectionist economic or trade policies in response to concerns about domestic economic conditions which could lead to diminished cross-border trade and financing activity within that country or region, all of which could negatively affect the Firm’s business and earnings in those jurisdictions.Political and economic uncertainty can also undermine consumer, business and investor confidence, and thereby contribute to market volatility. For example, uncertainties concerning the timing and terms of the U.K.’s planned departure from the EU could have an adverse effect on global financial markets and may adversely impact global economic conditions more generally. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the arrangements agreed between the U.K. and the EU, including with respect to the ability of financial services companies to engage in business in the EU from legal entities organized in or operating from the U.K., it is possible that under some scenarios, the Firm may need to make changes to its legal entity structure and operations and the locations in which it operates, which might result in a less efficient operating model across the Firm’s European legal entities. Accordingly, it is possible that political or economic developments in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities, may adversely affect the Firm.The Firm must comply with economic sanctions and embargo programs administered by OFAC and similar multi-national bodies and governmental agencies outside U.S., including, most recently, sanctions targeted at individuals and companies in Russia. A violation of a sanction or embargo program could subject the Firm, and individual employees, to regulatory enforcement actions as well as significant civil and criminal penalties.JPMorgan Chase’s operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and may be subject to additional compliance costs and risks.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, low or negative growth, or defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have recently been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments; these developments have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest,   15Part Igeneral strikes and demonstrations, crime and corruption, security and personal safety issues, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firm’s operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the Firm conducts its businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations.Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firm’s operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions; the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the termination of licenses required to operate in the local market or the suspension of business relationships with governmental bodies.Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including monetary policies, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect, and in the past conditions of these types have affected, the Firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firm’s operations in the U.S. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firm’s business and results of operations.Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that the Firm will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring and operating its businesses outside the U.S. to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. JPMorgan Chase relies on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes, operational systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such processes or systems, or errors or misconduct by such employees, could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the Firm’s ability to process, record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis. The Firm’s front- and back-office trading systems similarly rely on their access to, and on the functionality of, the operational systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems, central counterparties, securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies. If the Firm’s financial, accounting, trading or other data processing systems, or the operational systems of third parties on which the Firm’s businesses are dependent, are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, as the speed, frequency, volume and complexity of transactions (and the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and financial intermediaries) increases, the risk of human and/or systems error in connection with such transactions increases, and it becomes more challenging to maintain the Firm’s operational systems and infrastructure. The effective functioning of the Firm’s operational systems is also dependent on the competence and reliability of its employees, as well as the employees of third parties on whom the Firm relies for technological support, and the Firm could be materially and adversely affected by a significant operational breakdown or failure caused by human error or misconduct by an employee of the Firm or a third party. In addition, when the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients and customers, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), damage to reputation, impairment of liquidity, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm.Third parties with which the Firm does business, including retailers, data aggregators and other third parties with which the Firm’s customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, particularly where activities of customers or such third parties are beyond the Firm’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. As the Firm’s interconnectivity with customers and other third parties increases, the Firm increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems. Security breaches affecting the Firm’s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or human error or misconduct affecting such other third 16  parties, may require the Firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Firm or its customers, thereby increasing the Firm’s operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact the Firm’s ability to conduct business.The Firm’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including clients, client’s clients, employees of the Firm and its suppliers and other third parties). Ensuring that the Firm’s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can increase the Firm’s operating costs, impact the development of new products or services and require significant oversight by management, and may require the Firm to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Furthermore, the Firm may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and the Firm, particularly where such information is transmitted by electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of clients, customers, employees or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), the Firm could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Firm’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause the Firm to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce the Firm’s revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure by the Firm to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage the Firm’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operational systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firm’s control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firm’s property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure  that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm or its customers and clients. Any failures or disruptions of the Firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or those of other market participants, could disrupt the Firm’s businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage the Firm’s reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm.Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of the Firm’s security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other companies, as well as governmental and political organizations, have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites, networks or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. The Firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses, and has experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services.Despite the Firm’s efforts to ensure the security and integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside the Firm, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments, and such third parties may seek to gain access to the Firm’s systems either directly or using equipment or security passwords belonging to employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the Firm’s systems. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and   17Part Iexpands its internal usage of web-based products and applications.Given the breadth of the Firm’s operations, the high volume of transactions that it processes, the large number of customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which the Firm does business, and the proliferation and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, a particular cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. The extent of a particular cyberattack and the steps that the Firm may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation could be completed and full and reliable information about the attack is known. During such time the Firm may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated, any or all of which could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyberattack.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firm’s systems or the systems of another market participant could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firm’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its clients, customers, counterparties or employees, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firm’s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Firm’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm.Risk ManagementJPMorgan Chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Firm, thereby resulting in losses.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Firm relies on data to aggregate and assess its various risk exposures, and any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of the Firm’s data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting. Any lapse in the Firm’s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firm’s risk management framework, governance, procedures, practices, models or risk reporting systems could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firm’s  financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposures, and also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firm’s financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.Certain of the Firm’s trading transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. Many of the Firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, including difficult or less liquid market environments, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the Firm’s risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses.Many of the models used by the Firm are subject to review not only by the Firm’s Model Risk function but also by the Firm’s regulators in order that the Firm may utilize such models in connection with the Firm’s calculations of market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under Basel III. The Firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators.18  In addition, the Firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the Firm. These requirements apply to the Firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and, more specifically, under certain of the consent orders to which the Firm has been subject. The Firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Failure by the Firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the Firm’s regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the Firm’s reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm.Other RisksActions or inaction by employees of the Firm may cause harm to the Firm’s clients and customers, damage the Firm’s reputation, negatively impact the Firm’s culture and lead to liability and regulatory and other governmental actions against the Firm. JPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients, customers and counterparties every day, and they are expected through their conduct to demonstrate the Firm’s values and exhibit the culture and behaviors that are an integral part of the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles, including the Firm’s commitment to “do first class business in a first class way”. If an employee takes an action (including a failure to act) that does not comply with the Firm’s Code of Conduct, is inconsistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business Principles or that otherwise harms clients, consumers or the market, such as improperly selling and marketing the Firm’s product or services, acting illegally with others to establish market prices, improperly hiring individuals related to “politically exposed persons” or misappropriating Firm property or confidential or proprietary information or technology belonging to the Firm, its customers or third parties, such activities could give rise to litigation, regulatory or other governmental investigations or enforcement actions, and judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, and lead to requirements that the Firm restructure certain of its operations and activities, all of which could harm the Firm’s reputation or result in collateral consequences. Although the Firm endeavors to embed culture and conduct risk management throughout an employee’s life cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training and development, and performance management, as well as through the Firm’s promotion and compensation processes, employees of the Firm have, from time to time in the past, engaged in improper or illegal conduct resulting in litigation as well as settlements involving consent orders, deferred prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements, as well as other civil and criminal settlements with regulators and other governmental entities, and there is no assurance that further inappropriate actions by employees will not occur or  that any such actions will always be deterred or quickly prevented.The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and the Firm expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors of the Firm include other banks and financial institutions, trading, advisory and investment management firms, finance companies and technology companies and other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading, payment processing and online automated algorithmic-based investment advice. New technologies have required and could require the Firm to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. Ongoing or increased competition, on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation, price or other factors, may put downward pressure on prices and fees for the Firm’s products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. In addition, the failure of any of the Firm’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance (relative to competitors or to benchmarks), could impact the Firm’s ability to retain clients and customers or attract new clients and customers, thereby reducing the Firm’s revenues. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.Non-U.S. competitors of the Firm’s wholesale businesses outside the U.S. are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on the Firm, making the Firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firm’s cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firm’s wholesale businesses.  19Part IJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are the Firm’s most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The Firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. There is the potential for changes in immigration policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including the U.S., and to the extent that immigration policies were to unduly restrict or otherwise make it more difficult for qualified employees to work in, or transfer among, jurisdictions in which the Firm has operations or conducts its business, the Firm could be adversely affected. The Firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession for the Firm’s Operating Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer position, and senior positions below the Operating Committee. The Firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a next-level role. In addition, the Firm’s Board of Directors is deeply involved in succession planning, including review of the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Operating Committee. If the Firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, the Firm’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements are based in part on estimates and judgments which, if incorrect, could result in unexpected losses in the future.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firm’s financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, instruments in the investment securities portfolio, certain loans, MSRs, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firm’s financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If estimates or judgments underlying the Firm’s financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses. Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations, profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that the Firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could damage its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firm’s business and prospects. Harm to the Firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. The Firm’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the Firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, the Firm’s reputation or prospects may be significantly damaged by adverse publicity or negative information regarding the Firm, whether or not true, that may be posted on social media, non-mainstream news services or other parts of the internet, and this risk can be magnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which information is disseminated through those channels. Management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firm’s clients. The failure or perceived failure to adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions. Likewise, the failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, to treat customers and clients fairly, to provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions. In the future, a failure or perceived failure to appropriately  address conflicts or fiduciary obligations could result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions, all of which can lead to lost 20  revenue and higher operating costs and cause serious harm to the Firm’s reputation.Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firm’s reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms during and after the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions or that a financial institution had acted inappropriately with respect to the methods employed in offering products to customers, have damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firm’s reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to its reputation could not adversely affect the Firm’s earnings and results of operations, or that damage to the Firm’s reputation will not impair the Firm’s ability to retain its existing or attract new customers, investors and employees"
17,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2016-02-23,": RISK FACTORSThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.Regulatory RiskJPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the Firm is subject.As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. The financial services industry has experienced and continues to experience an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, both in the U.S. and globally, and the cumulative effect of all of the new and proposed legislation and regulations on the Firm’s business, operations and profitability remains uncertain.The recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the U.S. and in the other countries in which the Firm operates, and any required changes to the Firm’s business or operations resulting from such developments and actions, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, impose additional compliance and other costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firm’s profitability, limit the products and services that the Firm offers or its ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s businesses. In addition, to the extent that legislative or regulatory initiatives are imposed on a limited subset of financial institutions (based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), the requirements to which the Firm may be subject under such laws and regulations could require the Firm to restructure its businesses, or re-price or curtail the products or services that it offers to customers, which could result in the Firm not being able to compete effectively with other institutions that are not impacted in the same way. In addition, there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in the U.S. and in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, recent legislative and regulatory initiatives within the EU, including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions, the separation of trading activities from core banking services, mandatory on-exchange trading, position limits and reporting rules for derivatives, conduct of business requirements, restrictions on compensation and governance and accountability regimes, could require the Firm to make significant modifications to its non-U.S. business, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements. These differences in implemented or proposed non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could subject the Firm to increased compliance and legal costs, as well as higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations and profitability.Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may continue to increase the Firm’s costs and risks.The Firm’s businesses and operations are increasingly subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny. The Firm has paid significant fines (or has provided significant monetary and other relief) to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies. The Firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject, which increases the Firm’s operational and compliance costs.Certain regulators have taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions against financial institutions (including the Firm) that require admissions of wrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection with settling such matters. Such admissions and conditions can lead to, among other things, greater exposure in civil litigation, harm to reputation, disqualification from providing business to certain clients and in certain jurisdictions, and other direct and indirect adverse effects.In addition, U.S. government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions, including the Firm, and have increasingly sought, and obtained, resolutions that include criminal pleas from those institutions, such as the Firm’s agreement in May 2015 to plead guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law in connection with its settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities. Such resolutions, whether with U.S. or non-U.S. authorities, could have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution, including loss of customers and business, or the inability to offer certain products or services, or losing permission to operate certain businesses, for a period of time (absent the 8  forbearance of, or the granting of waivers by, applicable regulators). The Firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than with informal supervisory action.In addition, if the Firm fails to meet the requirements of the various governmental settlements to which it is subject, or more generally, to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses. The extent of the Firm’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the Firm has established for such matters.Requirements for the orderly resolution of the Firm could require JPMorgan Chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses, and holders of JPMorgan Chase’s debt and equity securities would be at risk of absorbing losses if the Firm were to enter into a resolution.Under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title I”) and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules, the Firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a detailed plan for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its subsidiaries under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure. In August 2014, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced the completion of their reviews of the second round of Title I resolution plans submitted by eleven large, complex banking organizations in 2013, including the Firm. The agencies jointly identified specific shortcomings with the 2013 resolution plans, including the Firm’s 2013 plan. The FDIC’s board of directors determined under Title I that the 2013 resolution plans, including the Firm’s 2013 plan, were not credible and did not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Federal Reserve Board determined that the eleven banking organizations must take immediate actions to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 plans. The Firm has devoted significant resources to its resolution planning efforts, and believes that in its most recent Title I resolution plan submitted to the Federal Reserve and FDIC in July 2015, it has addressed, or has made substantial progress in addressing, each of the shortcomings previously identified by the agencies.However, if the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that the Firm’s 2015 plan, or any future update of that plan, is not credible, and the Firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital,  leverage or liquidity requirements on the Firm or restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the Firm, and could, if such deficiencies are not remedied within two years after such a determination, require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest businesses, legal entities, operational systems and/or intercompany transactions in ways that could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations and strategy. In addition, in order to develop a Title I resolution plan that the Federal Reserve and FDIC determine is credible, the Firm may need to make certain changes to its legal entity structure and to certain intercompany and external activities, which could result in increased funding or operational costs.In addition to the Firm’s plan for orderly resolution, the Firm’s resolution plan also recommends to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its proposed optimal strategy to resolve the Firm under the special resolution procedure provided in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”). The Firm’s recommendation involves a “single point of entry” recapitalization model in which the FDIC would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for JPMorgan Chase; transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the Firm’s business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity; recapitalize those subsidiaries by, among other things, converting some or all of such intercompany claims to capital; and exchange external debt claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. for equity in the bridge entity. As discussed below, the Federal Reserve has also proposed rules regarding the minimum levels of unsecured external long-term debt and other loss-absorbing capacity that bank holding companies would be required to have issued and outstanding, as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments, to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalization of the bridge entity and operating subsidiaries (“eligible LTD”). If JPMorgan Chase & Co. were to enter into a resolution, either in a proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or in a receivership administered by the FDIC under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, holders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity securities of the Firm would be at risk of absorbing the losses of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its affiliates. If JPMorgan Chase & Co. commenced proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, creditors and shareholders of JPMorgan Chase & Co. would realize value only to the extent available to JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its other subsidiaries, after the payment to the creditors of such subsidiaries. In addition, even under the Firm’s preferred resolution strategy under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act, the value of the stock of the bridge entity that would be redistributed to holders of the Firm’s eligible LTD and other debt securities may not be sufficient to repay all or part of the principal amount and interest on such debt. It is also possible that the application of the Firm’s recommended Title II strategy could result in greater losses to security holders of JPMorgan Chase & Co. than the losses that would result from a different resolution strategy for the Firm.  9Part IMarket RiskJPMorgan Chase’s results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and global financial market and economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates, currency and commodities prices (including oil prices) and other market indices; investor, consumer and business sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, health emergencies or pandemics, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of hostilities, terrorism or other geopolitical instabilities; monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks; and the health of the U.S. and global economies. These conditions can affect the Firm’s businesses both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the Firm’s clients and customers.In the Firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its clients and customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives, as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm.The Firm generally maintains market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities, credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; interest rate and credit spreads; and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions. Certain of the Firm’s market-making positions could be adversely affected by the lack of liquidity, which will be influenced by many of these factors, and which could affect the Firm’s ability to realize returns from such activities and adversely affect the Firm’s earnings.The Firm may be adversely affected by declining asset values. This is particularly true for businesses that earn fees for managing third-party assets or receive or post collateral. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the client assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firm’s revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firm’s funds or accounts or cause clients to invest funds in products that generate lower revenue.Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment may compress net interest margins,  reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) asset, thereby reducing the Firm’s net interest income and other revenues. Conversely, increasing or high interest rates may result in increased funding costs, lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the investment securities portfolio (to the extent that the Firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding assets), thereby adversely affecting the Firm’s revenues and capital levels.The Firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates, the rate of unemployment, housing prices, the level of consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies. If the recent positive trends in the U.S. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firm’s consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment due to economic dislocations in certain geographies or industries caused by falling oil and gas prices or other market or economic factors, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card, auto, student and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firm’s earnings.Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis, and may adversely affect the credit markets and the Firm’s businesses. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firm’s credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firm’s earnings on certain liabilities that are recorded at fair value. Sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets (including loans and derivatives) may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets, make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets, adversely affect the Firm’s profitability, capital or liquidity, or increase the Firm’s funding costs. Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and decreased revenue for the Firm.Credit RiskThe financial condition of JPMorgan Chase’s customers, clients and counterparties, particularly other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm.The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. The failure of a significant market participant, or concerns about a default by such an institution, could also 10  lead to significant liquidity problems for, or losses or defaults by, other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect the Firm. In addition, in recent years the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the Firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding to manipulate markets, prices or indices, and there is no assurance that such allegations will not arise in the same or similar contexts in the future.As part of providing clearing services, the Firm is a member of a number of central counterparties (“CCPs”), and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. As a clearing member, the Firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. In addition, the Firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients in connection with providing cash management, clearing, custodial and other transaction services to such clients. If a client for which the Firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may suffer losses, become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more CCPs, or the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. All of such events can increase the Firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the Firm is insufficient to cover such losses.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and the Firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers or counterparties are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. For example, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firm’s borrowers or counterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other borrowers or counterparties in similar, related or dependent industries and thereby could exacerbate the Firm’s credit risk exposure and potentially increase its losses, including mark-to-market losses in its trading businesses. Similarly, challenging economic conditions affecting a particular industry or geographic area could lead to concerns about the credit quality of the Firm’s borrowers or counterparties, not only in that particular industry or geography but in  related or dependent industries, wherever located, or about the ability of customers of the Firm’s consumer businesses living in such areas or working in such affected industries or related or dependent industries to meet their obligations to the Firm. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its exposures to assess potential concentration or contagion risks. The Firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against concentration risks may not be successful.In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firm’s inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but may also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firm’s balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firm’s businesses.Liquidity RiskIf JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (“SPEs”) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, default by a CCP or other counterparty, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future.If the Firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, is reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. In addition, the Firm’s cost of funding could be affected by actions that the Firm may take in order to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements, to lower its GSIB systemic risk score or to satisfy the amount of eligible LTD that the Firm must have outstanding under the final TLAC rules.As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s principal subsidiaries are   11Part Isubject to dividend distribution, capital adequacy or liquidity coverage requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase & Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations.Proposed banking regulations relating to liquidity, including U.S. rules relating to total loss-absorbing capacity, could require JPMorgan Chase to issue a substantial amount of new debt, and thereby significantly increase its funding costs.On October 30, 2015, the Federal Reserve issued proposed rules (the “proposed TLAC rules”) that would require the top-tier holding companies of eight U.S. global systemically important bank holding companies (“U.S. GSIB BHCs”), including JPMorgan Chase & Co., among other things, to maintain minimum amounts of eligible LTD, commencing January 1, 2019. The proposed TLAC rules would disqualify from eligible LTD, among other instruments, senior debt securities that permit acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default, as well as debt securities that are not governed by U.S. law and structured notes. The currently outstanding senior long-term debt of U.S. GSIB BHCs, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., includes structured notes as well as other debt that typically permits acceleration for reasons other than insolvency or payment default and, as a result, none of such outstanding senior long-term debt or any subsequently issued senior long-term debt with similar terms would qualify as eligible LTD under the proposed TLAC rules. The Federal Reserve has requested comment on whether certain currently outstanding instruments should be allowed to count as eligible LTD “despite containing features that would be prohibited under the proposal.” The steps that the U.S. GSIB BHCs, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., may need to take to come into compliance with the final TLAC rules, including the amount and form of long-term debt that must be refinanced or issued, will depend in substantial part on the ultimate eligibility requirements for senior long-term debt and any grandfathering provisions. To the extent that outstanding senior long-term debt of JPMorgan Chase & Co. is not classified as eligible LTD under the TLAC rule as finally adopted by the Federal Reserve, the Firm could be required to issue a substantial amount of new senior long-term debt which could significantly increase the Firm’s funding costs.Authorities in some non-U.S. jurisdictions in which the Firm has operations have enacted legislation or regulations requiring that certain subsidiaries of the Firm operating in those countries maintain independent capital and liquidity. In addition, some non-U.S. regulators have proposed that large banks which conduct certain businesses in their jurisdictions operate through separate subsidiaries located in those countries. These requirements, and any future laws or regulations that seek to increase capital or liquidity requirements that would be applicable to non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Firm, could hinder the Firm’s ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner. Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, legal expenses, assumptions surrounding government support, and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank and non-bank subsidiaries. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages, to the extent it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings, there is no assurance that the Firm’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future, or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the Firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.Furthermore, a reduction in the Firm’s credit ratings could reduce the Firm’s access to capital markets, materially increase the cost of issuing securities, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future.Legal RiskJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious harm to the Firm’s reputation. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations.In addition, and as noted above, the Firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. Regulators and other government agencies examine the operations of the Firm and its subsidiaries on both a routine- and targeted-exam basis, and there is no assurance that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the Firm in the future. 12  A single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These and other initiatives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities and officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm the Firm’s reputation or lead to higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firm’s profitability, or result in collateral consequences as discussed above.Other Business RisksJPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the U.S. and around the world.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies, such as “pegging” the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others) are beyond the Firm’s control and may be difficult to predict, and consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the Firm’s activities and results of operations.The Firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions, or the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries or regions in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below.Several of the Firm’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputation risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations.Further, various countries or regions in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. Low or volatile oil prices, coupled with the slowdown in the  macroeconomic prospects in China, and concerns about economic weaknesses in the Eurozone (including the permanent resolution of the Greek “bailout” program), could continue to undermine investor confidence and affect the operating environment in 2016. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to “market contagion” affecting other countries in the same region or beyond the region. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities, may adversely affect the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and may be subject to additional compliance costs and risks.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, low or negative growth, or defaults or potential defaults on sovereign debt, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries, as well as certain more developed countries, have recently been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments; these development have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, crime and corruption, security and personal safety issues, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firm’s operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the Firm conducts its businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations.Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firm’s operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions; the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions.  13Part IRevenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including monetary policies, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect, and in the past conditions of these types have affected, the Firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firm’s operations in the U.S. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firm’s business and results of operations.Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems or that the Firm will be able to develop effective working relationships with local regulators. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring and operating its businesses outside the U.S. to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.JPMorgan Chase relies on the effectiveness and integrity of its processes, operating systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such processes or systems or misconduct by such employees could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the Firm’s ability to process, record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis. The Firm’s front- and back-office trading systems similarly rely on their access to, and on the functionality of, the operating systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems, central counterparties, securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies. If the Firm’s financial, accounting, trading or other data processing systems, or the operating systems of third parties on which the Firm’s businesses are dependent, are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, as the speed, frequency, volume and complexity of transactions (and the requirements to report such transactions on a real-time basis to clients, regulators and financial intermediaries) increases, the risk of human and/or systems error in connection with such transactions increases, and it becomes  more challenging to maintain the Firm’s operational systems and infrastructure. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firm’s operations or systems. In addition, when the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services or new connectivity solutions, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients and customers, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), damage to reputation, impairment of liquidity, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm.Third parties with which the Firm does business, including retailers and other third parties with which the Firm’s customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Firm’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile devices or services. As the Firm’s interconnectivity with these third parties increases, the Firm increasingly faces the risk of operational failure with respect to their systems. Security breaches affecting the Firm’s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Firm or its customers, thereby increasing the Firm’s operational costs and potentially diminishing customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the interconnectivity of multiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and clearing houses, and the increased importance of these entities, increases the risk that an operational failure at one institution or entity may cause an industry-wide operational failure that could materially impact the Firm’s ability to conduct business.The Firm’s businesses are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals (including clients, client’s clients, employees of the Firm and its suppliers and other third parties). Ensuring that the Firm’s collection, use, transfer and storage of personal information complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including where the laws of different jurisdictions are in conflict, can increase the Firm’s operating costs, impact the development of new products or services and require significant oversight by management, and may require the Firm to structure its businesses, operations and systems in less efficient ways. Furthermore, the Firm may not be able to ensure that all of its clients, suppliers, counterparties and other third parties have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information exchanged between them and the Firm, particularly where such information is transmitted by 14  electronic means. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients or others were to be mishandled or misused (in situations where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties), the Firm could be exposed to litigation or regulatory sanctions. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of the Firm’s measures to safeguard personal information, or even the perception that such measures are inadequate, could cause the Firm to lose customers or potential customers for its products and services and thereby reduce the Firm’s revenues. Accordingly, any failure or perceived failure by the Firm to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations may subject it to inquiries, examinations and investigations that could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices or in significant liabilities, fines or penalties, and could damage the Firm’s reputation and otherwise adversely affect its businesses.The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firm’s control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firm’s property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm or its customers and clients. Any failures or disruptions of the Firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or those of other market participants, could disrupt the Firm’s businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm.Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of the Firm’s security measures will provide absolute security.  JPMorgan Chase and other companies have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. The Firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses, and has experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services.Despite the Firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside the Firm, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the Firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firm’s data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firm’s systems or the systems of another market participant could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firm’s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firm’s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Firm’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm.Risk ManagementJPMorgan Chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Firm, thereby resulting in losses.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop   15Part Iin the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Firm relies on data to aggregate and assess its various risk exposures, and any deficiencies in the quality or effectiveness of the Firm’s data aggregation and validation procedures could result in ineffective risk management practices or inaccurate risk reporting. Any lapse in the Firm’s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firm’s risk management framework, governance, procedures, practices, models or risk reporting systems could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.The Firm’s products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives and trading account assets, as well as the investment securities portfolio and cash management and clearing activities, expose the Firm to credit risk. The Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending-related commitments. The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firm’s financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.JPMorgan Chase’s market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firm’s trading transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations  where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, In addition, disputes with counterparties may arise regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts, including with respect to the value of underlying collateral, which could cause the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, operational, legal and litigation costs, or result in credit losses, all of which may impair the Firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products.In a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants or widespread market dislocations. Many of the Firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the Firm’s risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses.Many of the models used by the Firm are subject to review not only by the Firm’s Model Risk function but also by the Firm’s regulators in order that the Firm may utilize such models in connection with the Firm’s calculations of market risk risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach of Basel III. The Firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators.In addition, the Firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the Firm. These requirements apply to the Firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and, more specifically, under certain of the consent orders to which the Firm has been subject. The Firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Failure by the Firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could 16  result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the Firm’s regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the Firm’s reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm.Other RisksThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and the Firm expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors of the Firm include other banks and financial institutions, trading, advisory and investment management firms, finance companies and technology companies and other firms that are engaged in providing similar products and services. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading and payment processing. New technologies have required and could require the Firm to spend more to modify or adapt its products to attract and retain customers or to match products and services offered by its competitors, including technology companies. Ongoing or increased competition, on the basis of the quality and variety of products and services offered, transaction execution, innovation, reputation, price or other factors, may put downward pressure on prices for the Firm’s products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. In addition, the failure of any of the Firm’s businesses to meet the expectations of clients and customers, whether due to general market conditions or underperformance (relative to competitors or to benchmarks), could impact the Firm’s ability to retain clients and customers or attract new clients and customers, thereby reducing the Firm’s revenues. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on behalf of its clients in order to remain competitive. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.Competitors of the Firm’s non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, imposing higher capital and liquidity requirements on the Firm, making the Firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firm’s cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firm’s wholesale businesses. JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are the Firm’s most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The Firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. The Firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession for the Firm’s Operating Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer position, and senior positions below the Operating Committee. The Firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a next-level role. In addition, the Firm’s Board of Directors is deeply involved in succession planning, including review of the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Operating Committee. If for any reason the Firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, the Firm’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements are based in part on estimates and judgments which, if incorrect, could result in unexpected losses in the future.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use estimates and apply judgments in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firm’s financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, instruments in the investment securities portfolio, certain loans, MSRs, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firm’s financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If estimates or judgments underlying the Firm’s financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses.Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations, profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that the Firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially   17Part Iand adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could damage its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firm’s business and prospects. Harm to the Firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. The Firm’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure or perceived failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the Firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, to treat customers and clients fairly, to provide fiduciary products or services in accordance with the appropriate standards, or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Firm’s reputation. Adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firm’s prospects.Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firm’s clients. The failure or perceived failure to adequately address or appropriately disclose conflicts of interest has given rise to litigation and enforcement actions and may do so in the future and could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, as well as cause serious harm to the Firm’s reputation. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firm’s reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms during the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firm’s reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the damage to its reputation could not adversely affect the Firm’s earnings and results of operations, or that damage to the Firm’s reputation will not impair the Firm’s ability to retain its existing or attract new customers, investors and employees"
2,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2015-02-24,": RISK FACTORSThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.Regulatory RiskJPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which the Firm is subject.As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the Firm does business, and can restrict the scope of the Firm’s existing businesses, limit the Firm’s ability to expand the products and services that it offers or make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers.The financial services industry continues to experience an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. Significant and comprehensive new legislation and regulations affecting the financial services industry have been adopted or proposed in recent years, both in the U.S. and globally. The Firm continues to make appropriate adjustments to its business and operations, legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies, procedures and controls to comply with these new laws and regulations. However, the cumulative effect of all of the new and proposed legislation and regulations on the Firm’s business, operations and profitability remains uncertain.The recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the U.S. and in the other countries in which the Firm operates, and any required changes to the Firm’s business or operations resulting from such developments and actions, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, impose additional compliance and other costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firm’s profitability, limit the products and services that the Firm offers or its ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s businesses.Non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, operations or profitability. There can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. For example, recent EU legislative and regulatory initiatives, including those relating to the resolution of financial institutions, the proposed separation of trading activities from core banking services, mandatory on-exchange trading, position limits and reporting rules for derivatives, conduct of business requirements and restrictions on compensation, could require the Firm to make significant modifications to its non-U.S. business, operations and legal entity structure in order to comply with these requirements. These differences in implemented or proposed non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the U.S., which could subject the Firm to increased compliance and legal costs, as well as higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations and profitability.Expanded regulatory and governmental oversight of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses will continue to increase the Firm’s costs and risks.The Firm’s businesses and operations are increasingly subject to heightened governmental and regulatory oversight and scrutiny. The Firm has paid significant fines (or has provided significant monetary and other relief) to resolve a number of investigations or enforcement actions by governmental agencies. In addition, the Firm continues to devote substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of regulatory consent orders and other settlements to which it is subject, including enhancing its procedures and controls, expanding its risk and control functions within its lines of business, investing in technology and hiring significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel, all of which have increased the Firm’s operational and compliance costs.If the Firm fails to meet the requirements of the regulatory settlements to which it is subject, or more generally, to maintain risk and control procedures and processes that meet the heightened standards established by its regulators and other government agencies, it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses. The extent of the Firm’s exposure to legal and regulatory matters may be unpredictable and could, in some cases, substantially exceed the amount of reserves that the Firm has established for such matters.The Firm expects that it and the financial services industry as a whole will continue to be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and governmental investigations and enforcement actions and that violations of law will more frequently be met with formal and punitive enforcement action, including the imposition of significant monetary and other sanctions, rather than with informal supervisory action. 8  In addition, certain regulators have announced policies, or taken measures in connection with specific enforcement actions, which make it more likely that the Firm and other financial institutions may be required to admit wrongdoing in connection with settling such matters. Such admissions can lead to, among other things, greater exposure in civil litigation and reputational harm.Finally, U.S. government officials have indicated and demonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions against financial institutions, and have increasingly sought, and obtained, resolutions that include criminal pleas from those institutions. Such resolutions can have significant collateral consequences for a subject financial institution, including loss of customers and business and (absent the forbearance of, or the granting of waivers by, applicable regulators) the inability to offer certain products or services or operate certain businesses for a period of time.Requirements for the orderly resolution of the Firm under the Dodd-Frank Act could require JPMorgan Chase to restructure or reorganize its businesses or make costly changes to its capital or funding structure.Under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title I”) and Federal Reserve and FDIC rules, the Firm is required to prepare and submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a detailed plan for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its subsidiaries under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other applicable insolvency laws in the event of future material financial distress or failure. In July 2014, the Firm submitted its third Title I resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and FDIC (the “2014 plan”). In August 2014, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC announced the completion of their reviews of the second round of Title I resolution plans submitted by eleven large, complex banking organizations (the “first wave filers”) in 2013, including the Firm’s Title I resolution plan submitted in 2013 (the “2013 plan”). Although the agencies noted some improvements from the original plans submitted by the first wave filers in 2012, the agencies also jointly identified specific shortcomings with the 2013 resolution plans, including the Firm’s 2013 plan, that will need to be addressed in 2015 submissions if not already addressed in the Firm’s 2014 plan. In addition, the FDIC board of directors determined under Title I that the 2013 resolution plans submitted by the first wave filers, including the Firm’s 2013 plan, are not credible and do not facilitate an orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (although the Federal Reserve Board did not make such a determination). The Federal Reserve Board determined that the first wave filers must take immediate action to improve their resolvability and reflect those improvements in their 2015 submissions.If the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC were to jointly determine that the Firm’s Title I resolution plan, or any future update of that plan, is not credible, and the Firm is unable to remedy the identified deficiencies in a timely manner, the regulators may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the Firm or  restrictions on growth, activities or operations of the Firm, and could require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest businesses, legal entities, operational systems and/or intercompany transactions in ways that could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations and strategy. In addition, in order to develop a Title I resolution plan that the Federal Reserve Board and FDIC determine is credible, the Firm may need to take actions to restructure intercompany and external activities, which could result in increased funding or operational costs.In addition to the Firm’s plan for orderly resolution, the Firm’s resolution plan also recommends to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its proposed optimal strategy to resolve the Firm under the special resolution procedure provided in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”). The Firm’s recommendation for its optimal Title II strategy would involve a “single point of entry” recapitalization model in which the FDIC would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for JPMorgan Chase, transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the Firm’s business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity, recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries, and by exchanging debt claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. for equity in the bridge entity. The Federal Reserve is also expected to propose rules regarding the minimum levels of unsecured long-term debt and other loss absorbing capacity that bank holding companies would be required to have issued and outstanding, as well as guidelines defining the terms of qualifying debt instruments, to ensure that adequate levels of debt are maintained at the holding company level for purposes of recapitalization. Issuing debt in the amounts that would be required under these proposed rules could lead to increased funding costs for the Firm. In addition, if the Firm were to be resolved under its recommended Title II strategy, no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of, and interest on, the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged.Market RiskJPMorgan Chase’s results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of hostilities or terrorism; monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve   9Part Iand other central banks; and the health of the U.S. and global economies. These conditions can affect the Firm’s businesses both directly and through their impact on the businesses and activities of the Firm’s clients and customers.In the Firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its clients and customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from fees and commissions, as well as the willingness of other financial institutions and investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm.The Firm generally maintains extensive market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities, credit and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; interest rate and credit spreads; and the availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by global economic and market conditions. Certain of the Firm’s market-making positions could be adversely affected by the lack of pricing transparency or liquidity, which will be influenced by many of these factors. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its market-making businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect the Firm’s ability to realize returns from such activities and could adversely affect the Firm’s earnings.The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in financial markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firm’s revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firm’s funds or accounts.Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment has and may continue to have an adverse effect on certain of the Firm’s businesses by compressing net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) asset, thereby reducing the Firm’s net interest income and other revenues. Conversely, increasing or high interest rates may result in increased funding costs, lower levels of commercial and residential loan originations and diminished returns on the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio (to the extent that the Firm is unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-yielding assets), thereby adversely affecting the Firm’s revenues and capital levels.The Firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by U.S. domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest  rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. If the current positive trends in the U.S. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firm’s consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card, auto, student and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firm’s earnings.Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firm’s credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firm’s earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value.Sudden and significant volatility in the prices of securities and other assets (including loan and derivatives) may curtail the trading markets for such securities and assets, make it difficult to sell or hedge such securities and assets, adversely affect the Firm’s profitability, capital or liquidity, or increase the Firm’s funding costs. Sustained volatility in the financial markets may also negatively affect consumer or investor confidence, which could lead to lower client activity and decreased fee-based income for the Firm.Credit RiskThe financial condition of JPMorgan Chase’s customers, clients and counterparties, particularly other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. In recent years, the perceived interrelationship among financial institutions has also led to claims by other market participants and regulators that the Firm and other financial institutions have allegedly violated anti-trust or anti-competition laws by colluding to manipulate markets, prices or indices.The Firm is a market leader in providing clearing and custodial services, and also acts as a clearing and custody bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market, including the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. Many of these services expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client, a central counterparty (“CCP”) or another market participant.10  As part of providing clearing services, the Firm is a member of a number of CCPs, and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. As a clearing member, the Firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. In its role as custodian bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market, the Firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients. If a client to which the Firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more CCPs, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. All of such events can increase the Firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the Firm declines in value.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral could increase in times of significant market stress, volatility or illiquidity, and the Firm could suffer losses during such periods if it is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful.In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firm’s inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but may also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firm’s balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firm’s businesses.Liquidity RiskIf JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or  are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (“SPEs”) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these severe conditions could not occur in the future.If the Firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, is reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability. In addition, regulations regarding the amount and types of securities that the Firm may use to satisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio requirements may also affect the Firm’s cost of funding.As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution, capital adequacy or liquidity coverage requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase & Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations.Regulators in some countries in which the Firm has operations have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to conduct certain businesses through separate subsidiaries in those countries, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder the Firm’s ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner.Reductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. Rating agencies evaluate both general and firm- and industry-specific factors when determining their credit ratings for a particular financial institution, including economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, future profitability, risk management practices, legal expenses, assumptions surrounding government support and ratings differentials between bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries. Although the Firm closely   11Part Imonitors and manages, to the extent it is able, factors that could influence its credit ratings, there is no assurance that the Firm’s credit ratings will not be lowered in the future, or that any such downgrade would not occur at times of broader market instability when the Firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.Furthermore, a reduction in the Firm’s credit ratings could reduce the Firm’s access to capital markets, materially increase the cost of issuing securities, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt and other obligations that JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries have issued or may issue in the future.Legal RiskJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations.In addition, and as noted above, the Firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. As the regulators and other government agencies continue to examine the operations of the Firm and its subsidiaries, there is no assurance that they will not pursue additional regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the Firm in the future. A single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies and officials in the U.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other governmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These and other initiatives from U.S. and non-U.S. governmental authorities and officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities or to cease offering certain products or services, all of which could harm the Firm’s reputation or lead to  higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firm’s profitability.Other Business RisksJPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the U.S. and around the world.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S. and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the U.S. and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies, such as “pegging” the exchange rate of their currency to the currencies of others) are beyond the Firm’s control and may be difficult to predict, and consequently, unanticipated changes in these policies could have a negative impact on the Firm’s activities and results of operations.The Firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities, loans and other obligations of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, negative effects from slowing growth rates or recessionary economic conditions, or the risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below.Several of the Firm’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations.Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. The ongoing crisis in Russia and impact of sanctions, coupled with sharp oil price declines, a potential slowdown in the macroeconomic prospects in China, and concerns about potential economic weaknesses in the Eurozone (including the permanent resolution of the Greek “bailout” program), could undermine investor confidence and affect the operating environment in 2015. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can cause a contraction of available credit and reduced activity among trading partners or create market volatility that could lead to “market contagion” affecting other countries in the same 12  region or beyond the region. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations or engages in only limited activities, will adversely affect the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s operations in emerging markets may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the U.S. and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firm’s operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the Firm conducts its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations.Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firm’s operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions; the promulgation of conflicting or ambiguous laws and regulations or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions.Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can affect, and in the past  conditions of these types have affected, the Firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firm’s operations in the U.S. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firm’s business and results of operations.Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring and operating its businesses outside the U.S. to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.JPMorgan Chase relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such systems or misconduct by such employees could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the Firm’s ability to process, record and monitor an increasingly large number of complex transactions and to do so on a faster and more frequent basis. The Firm’s front- and back-office trading systems similarly rely on their access to, and on the functionality of, the operating systems maintained by third parties such as clearing and payment systems, central counterparties, securities exchanges and data processing and technology companies. If the Firm’s financial, accounting, trading or other data processing systems, or the operating systems of third parties on which the Firm’s businesses are dependent, are unable to meet these increasingly demanding standards, or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially and adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially and adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firm’s operations or systems. In addition, when the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services and new remote connectivity solutions (including Internet and mobile banking services), the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients and customers, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory   13Part Iintervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm.Third parties with which the Firm does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which the Firm’s customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Firm’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the internet, personal smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Firm’s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Firm or its customers, thereby increasing the Firm’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction.If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Firm’s systems, employees or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise compromised by third parties.The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firm’s control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firm’s property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger-scale political events, including outbreaks of hostilities or terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm or its customers and clients. Any failures or disruptions of the Firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and  create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm.Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly update its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers and clients, there is no assurance that all of the Firm’s security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other companies have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. A cyberattack against the Firm in 2014 resulted in customer and internal data of the Firm being compromised. The Firm is regularly targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious code and viruses, and has also experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services.Despite the Firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to its systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of the Firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firm’s data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firm’s systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firm’s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firm’s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Firm’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm.14  Risk ManagementJPMorgan Chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Firm, thereby resulting in losses.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. Any lapse in the Firm’s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firm’s risk management framework, governance, procedures or practices could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.The Firm’s products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, as well as cash management and clearing activities, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nation’s largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending-related commitments. The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firm’s financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.JPMorgan Chase’s market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or  pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities or other obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products.In a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.Many of the Firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the Firm’s risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses.Many of the models used by the Firm are subject to review not only by the Firm’s Model Risk function but also by the Firm’s regulators in order that the Firm may utilize such models in connection with the Firm’s calculations of market risk risk-weighted assets (“RWA”), credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA under the Advanced Approach of Basel III. The Firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators.In addition, the Firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the Firm. These requirements apply to the Firm both under general guidance issued by its banking regulators and, more specifically, under certain of the consent orders to which the Firm is subject. The Firm has incurred and expects to   15Part Iincur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Failure by the Firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the Firm’s regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the Firm’s reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm.Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations, profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that the Firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.Other RisksThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment, and the Firm expects that competition in the U.S. and global financial services industry will continue to be intense. Competitors of the Firm include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading and payment processing. The Firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firm’s products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also  may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially and adversely affect its future results of operations.Competitors of the Firm’s non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. For example, the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule, have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the U.S. and may not be implemented into law in most countries. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, imposing higher capital requirements on the Firm, making the Firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firm’s cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firm’s wholesale businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to its success.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are the Firm’s most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The Firm endeavors to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate its existing employees. The Firm also seeks to retain a pipeline of senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession for the Firm’s Operating Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer position, and senior positions below the Operating Committee. The Firm regularly reviews candidates for senior management positions to assess whether they currently are ready for a next-level role. In addition, the Firm’s Board of Directors is deeply involved in succession planning, including review of the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and the members of the Operating Committee. If for any reason the Firm were unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, including successors to the Chief Executive Officer or members of the Operating Committee, the Firm’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial 16  statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firm’s financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firm’s financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimates and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firm’s financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses.Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could damage its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firm’s business and prospects. Harm to the Firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, security breaches, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. The Firm’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the Firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, to treat customers and clients fairly, or to handle or use confidential information of customers or clients appropriately or in compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Firm’s reputation. Adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media websites regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firm’s prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firm’s reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms during the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firm’s reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firm’s earnings and results of operations, or that damage to the Firm’s reputation will not impair the Firm’s ability to retain its existing or attract new customers, investors and employees. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firm’s clients. The failure or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm"
11,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2014-02-20,": RISK FACTORSThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.Regulatory RiskJPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject.As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the United States and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the Firm does business, and can restrict the scope of the Firm’s existing businesses and limit the Firm’s ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers.The Firm is currently experiencing an unprecedented increase in regulations and supervision, and such changes could have a significant impact on how the Firm conducts business. Significant and comprehensive new legislation and regulations affecting the financial services industry have been adopted or proposed in recent years, both in the United States and globally, most notably the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States. Certain key regulations such as the Volcker Rule and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital standards have now been adopted, and the Firm continues to make appropriate adjustments to its business and operations, legal entity structure and capital and liquidity management policies, procedures and controls to comply with these and other new laws and regulations. However, U.S. and other regulators continue to develop, propose and adopt rules and propose new regulatory initiatives, so the cumulative effect of all of the new legislation and regulations on the Firm’s business and operations remains uncertain. In addition, there can be significant differences in the ways that similar regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry are implemented in different countries and regions in which JPMorgan Chase does business. Non-U.S. regulations and  initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the United States, which could create increased compliance and other costs for the Firm and adversely affect its business, operations or profitability.These recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as future legislative or regulatory actions in the United States and in the other countries in which the Firm operates, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, impose additional costs on the Firm or otherwise reduce the Firm’s profitability, limit the Firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, require the Firm to dispose of or curtail certain businesses, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s businesses. Expanded regulatory oversight of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses will increase the Firm’s compliance costs and risks and may reduce the profitability of those businesses.In recent years the Firm has entered into several Consent Orders with its banking regulators and settlements with various governmental agencies, including the Consent Orders entered into in April 2011 relating to the Firm’s residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss mitigation activities; the February 2012 global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages; the Consent Orders entered into in January 2013 relating to the Firm’s Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering policies, procedures and controls and to Chief Investment Office risk management and control functions as well as trading activities; the Consent Orders entered into September 2013 concerning oversight of third parties, operational processes and control functions related to credit card collections litigation practices and to billing practices for credit monitoring products formerly offered by the Firm; the settlements in November 2013 of certain repurchase representation and warranty claims by a group of institutional investors and with the U.S. Department of Justice, several other federal agencies and several State Attorneys General relating to certain residential mortgage-backed securitization activities of the Firm, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual; the Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into in January 2014 with the U.S. Department of Justice and related agreements with the OCC and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (""FinCEN"") relating to Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC and the Firm's AML compliance program; and the February 2014 settlement entered into with several federal government agencies relating to the Firm’s participation in certain federal mortgage insurance programs. These Consent Orders and settlements require the Firm, among other things, to remediate specified deficiencies in certain controls and operational processes; in some cases, to engage internal or external personnel to review past transactions or to monitor the extent to which cited lapses   9Part Ihave been addressed; and to furnish its regulators with periodic reports concerning the Firm’s progress in meeting the requirements of the orders and settlements. The Firm has also paid significant fines and penalties or provided monetary and other relief in connection with many of these actions and settlements.The Firm is devoting substantial resources to satisfying the requirements of these Consent Orders and settlements, including comprehensive enhancements to its procedures and controls, the expansion of risk and control functions within each line of business, investments in technology and the hiring of significant numbers of additional risk, control and compliance personnel, all of which has increased the Firm’s operational and compliance costs. In addition to these enforcement actions, the Firm is experiencing heightened regulatory oversight of its compliance with applicable laws and regulations, particularly with respect to its consumer businesses. The Firm expects that such regulatory scrutiny will continue, and that regulators will continue to take formal enforcement action, rather than taking informal supervisory actions, more frequently than they have done historically.If the Firm fails to successfully address the requirements of the Consent Orders, the Deferred Prosecution Agreement and the other regulatory settlements and enforcement actions to which it is subject, or more generally, to effectively enhance its risk and control procedures and processes to meet heightened expectations by its regulators, it may continue to face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions and litigation, thereby increasing its costs associated with responding to or defending such actions, and it could be required to enter into further orders and settlements, pay additional fines, penalties or judgments, or accept material regulatory restrictions on its businesses, which could adversely affect the Firm’s operations and, in turn, its financial results. In addition, further regulatory inquiries, investigations and actions, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting the Firm’s businesses, and any required changes to the Firm’s business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the products or services the Firm offers, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional compliance costs on the Firm, cause harm to the Firm’s reputation or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s businesses.Under the Firm’s resolution plan required to be submitted by the Dodd-Frank Act resolution provisions, holders of the Firm’s debt obligations are at clear risk of loss in any resolution proceedings.In October 2013, JPMorgan Chase submitted to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its annual update to its plan for resolution of the Firm. The Firm’s resolution plan includes strategies to resolve the Firm under the Bankruptcy Code, and also recommends to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve  the Firm’s proposed optimal strategy to resolve the Firm under the special resolution procedure provided in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).The Firm’s recommendation for its optimal Title II strategy would involve a “single point of entry” recapitalization model in which the FDIC would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for JPMorgan Chase, transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the Firm’s business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity, recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries, and by exchanging debt claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. for equity in the bridge entity. If the Firm were to be resolved under this strategy, no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of, and interest on, the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged.Market RiskJPMorgan Chase’s results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the economic effects of natural disasters, several weather conditions, acts of war or terrorism; monetary policies and actions taken by the Federal Reserve and other central banks and the health of U.S. or international economies.In the Firm’s wholesale businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect transactions involving the Firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from its private equity business; the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from commissions and spreads; and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm.The Firm generally maintains extensive market-making positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The Firm may have market-making positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks, volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets, credit spreads, and 10  availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by economic and market conditions. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its market-making and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities, and that this could materially adversely affect the Firm’s earnings.The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firm’s revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firm’s funds or accounts.Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the Firm’s businesses by compressing net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) asset, thereby reducing the Firm’s net interest income and other revenues.The Firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. If the current positive trends in the U.S. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firm’s consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firm’s earnings.Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firm’s credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firm’s earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value.Finally, adverse economic and financial market conditions in specific countries or regions can have significant adverse effects on the Firm’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For example, during the recent Eurozone debt crisis, concerns about the possibility of one or more sovereign debt defaults, significant bank failures or defaults and/or the exit of one or more countries from the European Monetary Union resulted in, among other things, declines in market liquidity, a contraction of  available credit, and diminished economic growth and business confidence in the Eurozone. There are continuing concerns as to the ultimate financial effectiveness of the assistance measures taken to date, and the extent to which the austerity measures may exacerbate high unemployment and test the social and political stability of weaker economies in the Eurozone. The Firm’s business and results of operations can be adversely affected both by localized economic crises in parts of the world where the Firm does business or when regional economic turmoil causes deterioration of global economic conditions.Credit RiskThe financial condition of JPMorgan Chase’s customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, investment managers and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client.The Firm is a market leader in providing clearing and custodial services, and also acts as a clearing and custody bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market, including the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. Many of these services expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client, a central counterparty (“CCP”) or another market participant.  As part of providing clearing services, the Firm is a member of a number of CCPs, and may be required to pay a portion of the losses incurred by such organizations as a result of the default of other members. As a clearing member, the Firm is also exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients, which it seeks to mitigate through the maintenance of adequate collateral. In its role as custodian bank in the securities and repurchase transaction market, the Firm can be exposed to intra-day credit risk of its clients. If a client to whom the Firm provides such services becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with various parties, including one or more CCP’s, the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations. All of such events can increase the Firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if any collateral received by the Firm declines in value. During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors as   11Part Ito the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Periods of illiquidity could produce losses if the Firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful.In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firm’s inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firm’s balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firm’s businesses.Liquidity RiskIf JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (“SPEs”) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity (such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets) during that time, and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future.If the Firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, are reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability.As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and,  consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution or capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase & Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position.Some regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in countries in which they operate, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder the Firm’s ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner.Reductions in the Firm’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., are currently rated by credit rating agencies. In 2013, Moody’s downgraded its ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and several other bank holding companies based on Moody’s reassessment of its assumptions relating to implicit government support for such companies. In addition, as of year-end 2013, S&P had JPMorgan Chase & Co. on “negative” outlook, indicating the possibility of a downgrade in ratings. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future. Furthermore, the rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, regulatory developments, rating uplift assumptions surrounding government support, future profitability, risk management practices and legal expenses, all of which could lead to adverse ratings actions. There is no assurance that any such downgrades from rating agencies, if they affected the Firm’s credit ratings, would not occur at times of broader market instability when the Firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.Further, a reduction in the Firm’s credit ratings could reduce the Firm’s access to debt markets, materially increase the cost of issuing debt, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt obligations that they have issued or may issue in the future.12  Legal RiskJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially adversely affect the Firm’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations.In addition, and as noted above, the Firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. As the regulators and other government agencies continue to examine the operations of the Firm and its bank subsidiaries, there is no assurance that additional consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firm’s revenue.Business and Operational RisksJPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the United States and around the world.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the United States and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies) are beyond the Firm’s control and, consequently, the impact of changes in these policies on the Firm’s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.The Firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below. Several of the Firm’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations.Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. In some cases, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of one or more countries can lead to “market contagion” to other countries in the same region or beyond the region. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations, will adversely affect the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s international strategy may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks.JPMorgan Chase has expanded and plans to continue to grow its international wholesale businesses in Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”), Asia/Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean over time.  As part of its international strategy, the Firm seeks to provide a wider range of financial services to its clients that conduct business in those regions.Some of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the United States and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firm’s operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in certain countries or regions in which the Firm conducts its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations, and there can be no assurance that the Firm will be able to successfully execute its international strategy.  13Part ILess developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firm’s operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions.Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected the Firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firm’s operations in the United States. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firm’s business and results of operations.Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring its operations outside the United States to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.JPMorgan Chase’s commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the Firm to significant cost and liability.JPMorgan Chase engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. The Firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result of all of these  activities, the Firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. The Firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity, and to restrict some of the Firm’s activities, which could result in lower revenues from the Firm’s commodities activities. In addition, the Firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore, liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations.The Firm’s commodities activities also further expose the Firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to the Firm’s reputation and suspension of operations. The Firm’s commodities activities are also subject to disruptions, many of which are outside of the Firm’s control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. The Firm’s actions to mitigate its risks related to the above-mentioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.JPMorgan Chase relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees, and those of third parties, and certain failures of such systems or misconduct by such employees could materially adversely affect the Firm’s operations.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the Firm’s ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. If the Firm’s financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firm’s operations or systems. In addition, as the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firm’s ability to 14  operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm.Third parties with which the Firm does business, as well as retailers and other third parties with which the Firm’s customers do business, can also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, including with respect to security breaches affecting such parties and breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties. Incidents of these types may require the Firm to take steps to protect the integrity of its own operational systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Firm or its customers, thereby increasing the Firm’s operational costs and potentially diminish customer satisfaction. If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Firm’s systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firm’s control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firm’s property or assets; natural disasters or severe weather conditions; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm. Any failures or disruptions of the Firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance. A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm.Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers, there is no assurance that all of the Firm’s security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. In particular, the Firm has experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt online banking services, as well as data breaches due to cyberattacks which, in certain instances, have resulted in unauthorized access to customer data.Despite the Firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firm’s data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firm’s systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firm’s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firm’s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant   15Part Ilitigation exposure, and harm to the Firm’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm.Risk ManagementJPMorgan Chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to the Firm, thereby resulting in losses.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject.  However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. Any lapse in the Firm’s risk management framework and governance structure or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firm’s risk management framework, governance, procedures or practices could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.The Firm’s products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, as well as cash management and clearing activities, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nation’s largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending commitments. The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firm’s financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the possibility that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.JPMorgan Chase’s market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa)  may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products.In a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.Many of the Firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited and could again limit the effectiveness of the Firm’s risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses.Many of the models used by the Firm are subject to review not only by the Firm’s Model Risk function but also by the Firm’s regulators in order that the Firm may utilize such models in connection with the Firm’s calculations of market risk risk-weighted assets (“RWA”) and credit risk RWA under the Advanced Approach of Basel III. The Firm may be subject to higher capital charges, which could adversely affect its financial results or limit its ability to expand its businesses, if such models do not receive approval by its regulators. In addition, there is no assurance that the amount of capital that the Firm holds with respect to operational risk, as derived from its operational risk capital model required under the Basel III capital standards, will 16  not be required to increase, which may have the effect of reducing the Firm’s profitability.In addition, the Firm must comply with enhanced standards for the assessment and management of risks associated with vendors and other third parties that provide services to the Firm. These requirements apply to the Firm both under general guidance issued by the banking regulators and, more specifically, under the Consent Order entered into by the Firm relating to collections litigation practices. The Firm has incurred and expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its initiatives to address the risks associated with oversight of its third party relationships. Failure by the Firm to appropriately assess and manage third party relationships, especially those involving significant banking functions, shared services or other critical activities, could result in potential liability to clients and customers, fines, penalties or judgments imposed by the Firm’s regulators, increased operating expenses and harm to the Firm’s reputation, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Firm.Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations, profitability or reputation.There can be no assurance that the Firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in every circumstance or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could not occur again. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.Other RisksThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the Firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as the financial services industry produces better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices.Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, investment managers, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing  companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. The Firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firm’s products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations.Competitors of the Firm’s non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. For example, the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule and the derivatives “push-out” rules, have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the United States and may not be implemented into law in most countries. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, making the Firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firm’s cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firm’s wholesale businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Firm’s performance.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are the Firm’s most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Firm or its employees of restrictions on executive compensation may adversely affect the Firm’s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Firm’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.  17Part IJPMorgan Chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firm’s financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firm’s financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firm’s financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses.Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could damage its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firm’s business and prospects. Harm to the Firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. The Firm’s reputation could also be harmed by the failure of an affiliate, joint-venturer or merchant banking portfolio company, or a vendor or other third party with which the Firm does business, to comply with laws or regulations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Firm’s reputation. Adverse publicity regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firm’s prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firm’s reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firm’s reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving  rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firm’s earnings and results of operations.Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firm’s clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm"
0,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2013-02-28,": RISK FACTORSThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.Regulatory RiskJPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject.As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under federal and state laws in the United States and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the Firm does business, and can restrict the scope of its existing businesses and limit its ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers.The U.S. Department of the Treasury, the FSOC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB and the FDIC are all engaged in extensive rule-making mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, and a substantial amount of the rule-making remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Firm’s business, operations and earnings remains uncertain. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and such rule-making are discussed in more detail below. For further information, see Supervision and regulation on pages 1–8.Debit interchange. The Firm believes that, as a result of the “Durbin Amendment” provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which limit the amount that the Firm can charge for each debit card transaction, the Firm’s annualized net income has been reduced by approximately $600 million per year. Although the Firm continues to consider various actions to mitigate this reduction in net income, it is unlikely that any such actions will wholly offset such reduction.Volcker Rule. Until the final regulations under the Volcker Rule are adopted, the precise definition of prohibited “proprietary trading”, the scope of any exceptions, including those related to market-making and hedging activities, and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund investments remain uncertain. It is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of the Firm’s market-making-related and risk mitigation activities, as currently conducted, will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected. In addition, the rules, if enacted as proposed, could prohibit the Firm’s participation and investment in certain securitization structures and could bar the Firm from sponsoring or investing in certain non-U.S. funds. Also, should regulators not exercise their authority to permit the Firm to hold certain investments, including those in illiquid private equity funds, beyond the minimum statutory 8  divestment period, the Firm could incur substantial losses when it disposes of such investments. The Firm may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating investments at the same time.Derivatives. In addition to imposing comprehensive regulation on the Firm’s derivatives businesses, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking entities, such as JPMorgan Chase, to significantly restructure their derivatives businesses, including changing the legal entities through which such businesses are conducted. Further, some of the rules for swaps will apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the United States. Clients of non-U.S. firms doing business outside the United States may not be required to comply with the same rules in similar transactions. This disparity in the application of the different rules could place JPMorgan Chase at a significant competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on the earnings and profitability of the Firm’s wholesale businesses.Heightened prudential standards for systemically important financial institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, JPMorgan Chase is considered to be a systemically important financial institution and is subject to heightened prudential standards and supervision. If the proposed rules issued by the Federal Reserve in December 2011 are adopted as currently proposed, they are likely to increase the Firm’s operational, compliance and risk management costs, and could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations or financial condition.CFPB. The CFPB has issued final regulations regarding mortgages which will become effective in January 2014 and which will prohibit mortgage servicers from beginning foreclosure proceedings until a mortgage loan is 120 days delinquent, and will impose an “ability to repay” requirement for residential mortgage loans. Other new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses, result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such businesses. In addition, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act’s potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, the Firm could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing its legal and compliance costs.Resolution. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve have issued a final rule that requires the Firm to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure (a “resolution plan”). The FDIC also issued a final rule that requires the Firm to submit periodic contingency plans to the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act outlining its resolution plan in the event of its failure. The Firm’s initial resolution plan submissions were filed in July  2012, and updates are due annually. If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve determine that the Firm’s resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements on the Firm, or restrictions on the growth, activities or operations of the Firm, or require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest certain assets or operations in order to facilitate an orderly resolution. Any such measures, particularly those aimed at the disaggregation of the Firm, may reduce the Firm’s capital, adversely affect the Firm’s operations and profitability, increase the Firm’s systems, technology and managerial costs, lessen efficiencies and economies of scale and potentially impede the Firm’s business strategies.In addition, holders of subordinated debt or preferred stock issued by the Firm may be fully subordinated to interests held by the U.S. government in the event that the Firm enters into a receivership, insolvency, liquidation or similar proceeding.Concentration Limits. The Dodd-Frank Act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies in the United States. The Federal Reserve is expected to issue rules related to these provisions in 2013. This concentration limit could restrict the Firm’s ability to make acquisitions in the future, thereby adversely affecting its growth prospects.The total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators respond to the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations under the Act, and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations will affect the businesses and operations of the Firm. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, as well as in the other countries in which the Firm operates, could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, limit the Firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional costs on the Firm, or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations or financial condition.Non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the United States, which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect the Firm’s business, operations or profitability.The EU has created a European Systemic Risk Board to monitor financial stability, and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (“G-20”) broadened the membership and scope of the Financial Stability Forum in 2008 to form the FSB. These institutions, which are   9Part Icharged with developing ways to promote cross-border financial stability, are considering various proposals to address risks associated with global financial institutions. Some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries. In the U.K., regulators have increased liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K.; adopted a Bank Tax Levy that applies to balance sheets of branches and subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks; proposed that non-U.K. banks either obtain equal treatment for U.K. depositors or “subsidiarize” in the U.K.; and proposed the creation of resolution and recovery plans by U.K. regulated entities, among other initiatives.In the EU, there is an extensive and complex program of proposed regulatory enhancement which reflects, in part, the EU’s commitments to policies of the G-20 together with other plans specific to the EU. This program includes the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) which, among other things, would require central clearing of standardized derivatives and which is likely to be phased in starting in 2013. It also includes the revision of the existing Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID II”) to deliver, among other things, the G20 commitment to on-venue trading of derivatives. Both EMIR and MiFID II include many other regulatory requirements that may have wide-ranging and material effects on the Firm’s business operations.The EU is also currently considering significant revisions to laws covering: depositary activities; credit rating activities; resolution of banks, investment firms and market infrastructures; anti-money-laundering controls; data security and privacy; and corporate governance in financial firms, together with implementation in the EU of the Basel III capital standards. In addition, the Firm is monitoring any potential implications for its business of developments in relation to both bank structure (in respect of which both the EU itself and a variety of EU Member States unilaterally are considering new rules) and the EU’s plans for a single supervisory mechanism for systemic banks under the European Central Bank. For example, the U.K. Independent Commission on Banking (the “Vickers Commission”) proposed provisions, which are now set forth in draft legislation, that would mandate the separation (or “ring-fencing”) of deposit-taking activities from securities trading and other analogous activities within banks, subject to certain exemptions. The final legislation is expected to adopt and include the supplemental recommendation of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards (the “Tyrie Commission”) that such ring-fences should be “electrified” by the imposition of mandatory forced separation on banking institutions that are deemed to test the limits of the safeguards. It is believed that the Firm will have the benefit of the above-referenced exemptions from the requirement to “ring-fence,” but this cannot be determined until the criteria are known with certainty.  Parallel but distinct draft provisions have been published by the French and German governments which could affect the Firm’s operations in those countries.It is not possible to determine at the current time how these various proposals will affect the Firm’s businesses, or how each relate to the European Commission’s forthcoming legislative proposals on bank structure arising out of the Report of the High Level Expert Group on Reforming the Structure of the EU Banking Sector (the “Liikanen Group”). However, as regulatory requirements that are being proposed by these various regulators may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations to which the Firm is subject in the United States (as well as in other parts of the world), the Firm may, if these proposals are adopted, be subjected to higher compliance and legal costs, as well as the possibility of higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations and profitability in the future.The Basel III capital standards will impose additional capital, liquidity and other requirements on the Firm that could decrease its competitiveness and profitability.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) announced in December 2010 revisions to its Capital Accord; such revisions are commonly referred to as “Basel III”. Basel III will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks, narrow the definition of capital, expand the definition of risk-weighted assets, and introduce short-term liquidity and term funding standards, among other things. In June 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies published proposed capital rules to implement Basel III.Capital Surcharge. In June 2011, the Basel Committee and the FSB proposed that GSIBs be required to maintain additional capital above the Basel III Tier 1 common equity minimum. See page 5 in Item 1: Business, for further information on the proposed capital change. Based on the Firm’s current understanding of these new capital requirements, the Firm expects that it will be in compliance with all of the standards to which it will be subject as they become effective. However, compliance with these capital standards may reduce the Firm’s return on equity or cause the Firm to alter the types of products it offers to its customers and clients, thereby causing the Firm’s products to become less attractive or placing the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to financial institutions, both within and outside the United States, that are not subject to the same capital surcharge.Liquidity Coverage and Net Stable Funding Ratios. The Basel Committee has also proposed two new measures of liquidity risk: the “liquidity coverage ratio” and the “net stable funding ratio,” which are intended to measure, during an acute stress, over different time spans, the amount of the liquid assets held by the Firm in relation to liquidity required. If the ratios are finalized as currently proposed, the Firm may need to incur additional costs to raise liquidity and to take certain mitigating actions, such as ceasing to 10  offer certain products to its customers and clients or charging higher fees for extending certain lines of credit, in order to be in compliance with such ratios. Accordingly, compliance with these liquidity coverage standards could adversely affect the Firm’s funding costs or reduce its profitability in the future.Elimination of Use of External Credit Ratings. The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have issued final rules for risk-based capital guidelines which eliminate the use of external credit ratings for the calculation of risk-weighted assets. This will result in a significant increase in the calculation of the Firm’s risk-weighted assets, which will require the Firm to hold more capital, increase its cost of doing business and place the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors.Expanded regulatory oversight of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses will increase the Firm’s compliance costs and risks and may negatively affect the profitability of such businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to its compliance with consumer laws and regulations, including changes implemented as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Firm has entered into Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to its Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) policies, procedures and controls and with respect to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. The Firm also agreed in 2012 to a global settlement with a number of federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The mortgage-related Consent Order and global settlement require the Firm to make cash payments and provide certain refinancing and other borrower relief, as well as to adhere to certain enhanced mortgage servicing standards, and the BSA/AML Consent Order will require the Firm to make enhancements to its procedures, make investments in its technology and hire additional personnel, all of which will increase the Firm’s operational and compliance costs.New regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in the product offerings and practices of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses and affect the profitability of such businesses.Finally, as a result of increasing federal and state scrutiny of the Firm’s consumer practices, the Firm may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions and litigation, thereby increasing its costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting the Firm’s consumer businesses, and any required changes to the Firm’s business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the products or services the Firm offers, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose  additional compliance costs on the Firm, cause harm to the Firm’s reputation or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s consumer businesses. If the Firm does not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to its consumer operations, the Firm may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on its businesses, which could adversely affect the Firm’s operations and, in turn, its financial results.Implementation of the Firm’s resolution plan under the U.S. resolution plan rules could materially impair the claims of JPMorgan Chase debt holders.As noted above, in July 2012 JPMorgan Chase submitted to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC its initial plan for resolution of the Firm. The Firm’s resolution plan includes strategies to resolve the Firm under the Bankruptcy Code, and also recommends to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve the Firm’s proposed optimal strategy to resolve the Firm under the special resolution procedure provided in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).The Firm’s recommendation for its optimal Title II strategy would involve a “single point of entry” recapitalization model in which the FDIC would use its power to create a “bridge entity” for JPMorgan Chase, transfer the systemically important and viable parts of the Firm’s business, principally the stock of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s main operating subsidiaries and any intercompany claims against such subsidiaries, to the bridge entity, recapitalize those businesses by contributing some or all of such intercompany claims to the capital of such subsidiaries, and by exchanging debt claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co. for equity in the bridge entity. If the Firm were to be resolved under this strategy, no assurance can be given that the value of the stock of the bridge entity distributed to the holders of debt obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or part of the principal amount of, and interest on, the debt obligations for which such stock was exchanged.Market RiskJPMorgan Chase’s results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism; and the health of U.S. or international economies.In the Firm’s wholesale businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect transactions involving the Firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from its private equity business; the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its customers and,   11Part Itherefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from commissions and spreads; and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm.The Firm generally maintains extensive positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. The Firm may have market-making positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks, volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets, credit spreads, and availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by economic and market conditions. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its market-making and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities, and that this could materially adversely affect the Firm’s earnings.The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firm’s revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firm’s funds or accounts.Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firm’s balance sheet and the revenue that the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the Firm’s businesses by compressing net interest margins, reducing the amounts that the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) asset, thereby reducing the Firm’s net interest income and other revenues.The Firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. If the current positive trends in the U.S. economy are not sustained, this could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firm’s consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firm’s earnings.Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions.  Changes in the Firm’s credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firm’s earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value.Despite improved financial market conditions, many of the structural issues facing the Eurozone remain and problems could resurface which could have significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Notwithstanding improved financial market conditions, many of the structural issues facing the Eurozone remain and problems could resurface which could have significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, particularly if they lead to sovereign debt default, significant bank failures or defaults and/or the exit of one or more countries from the European Monetary Union (the “EMU”).The ECB’s Outright Monetary Transaction program continues to underpin an improved risk environment, shifting the focus of the crisis from immediate financing strains to the more structural challenges of fiscal retrenchment and stimulation of GDP growth. However, financial market conditions could materially worsen if, for example, consecutive Eurozone countries were to default on their sovereign debt, significant bank failures or defaults in these countries were to occur, and/or one or more of the members of the Eurozone were to exit the EMU. Yields on government bonds of certain Eurozone countries, including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, have remained volatile, despite various stabilization packages and facilities that have been implemented to assist various distressed Eurozone countries. Concerns have been and continue to be raised as to the financial effectiveness of the assistance measures taken to date and such concerns could intensify. Concerns could also be triggered by political developments, with key elections in Italy and Germany during 2013, and ongoing uncertainty about the tolerance of austerity across the Eurozone.Continued economic turmoil in the Eurozone could lead to a further deterioration of global economic conditions and thereby adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations in Europe and elsewhere. There can be no assurance that the various steps that JPMorgan Chase has taken to protect its businesses, results of operations and financial condition against the results of the Eurozone crisis will be sufficient.Further, the effects of the Eurozone debt crisis could be even more significant if they lead to a partial or complete break-up of the EMU. The partial or full break-up of the EMU would be unprecedented and its impact highly uncertain. The exit of one or more countries from the EMU or the dissolution of the EMU could lead to redenomination of certain obligations of obligors in exiting countries. Any such exit and redenomination would cause significant uncertainty with respect to outstanding obligations of counterparties and debtors in any exiting country, whether sovereign or otherwise, and lead to complex and lengthy disputes and litigation. The resulting uncertainty and 12  market stress could also cause, among other things, severe disruption to equity markets, significant increases in bond yields generally, potential failure or default of financial institutions, including those of systemic importance, a significant decrease in global liquidity, a freeze-up of global credit markets and a potential worldwide recession. Any combination of such events could negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, one or more EMU exits and currency redenominations could be accompanied by imposition of capital, exchange and similar controls, which could further negatively impact JPMorgan Chase’s cross-border risk and other aspects of its businesses and its earnings. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis - Country Risk Management” on pages 170–173 for a discussion of the Firm’s European exposures.Changes are being considered in the method for determining LIBOR and it is not apparent how any such changes could affect the value of LIBOR-linked obligations of JPMorgan Chase, or how such changes could affect the Firm’s financial condition or results of operations.Beginning in 2008, concerns have been raised about the accuracy of the calculation of the daily London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), which is currently overseen by the British Bankers’ Association (the “BBA”). The BBA has taken steps to change the process for determining LIBOR by increasing the number of banks surveyed to set LIBOR and to strengthen the oversight of the process. The final report of the Wheatley Review of LIBOR, published in September 2012, set forth recommendations relating to the setting and administration of LIBOR, including the gradual phasing out of certain currencies and maturities. In December 2012 the U.K. government adopted legislation enacting one of those recommendations, making it a criminal offense to attempt to manipulate the setting of benchmark rates. The U.K. government also announced that the U.K. Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) intends to incorporate the rest of the Wheatley Review recommendations in new regulations relating to the LIBOR process.At the present time it is uncertain the extent of changes, if any, may be required or made by the FSA or other governmental or regulatory authorities in the method for determining LIBOR. Accordingly, at the present time it is not apparent whether or to what extent any such changes would have an adverse impact on the value of any LIBOR-linked debt securities issued by the Firm or any loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit for which the Firm is an obligor, or whether or to what extent any such changes would have an adverse effect on the value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to the Firm, or on the Firm’s financial condition or results of operations. Credit RiskThe financial condition of JPMorgan Chase’s customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm.If the current positive economic trends globally are not sustained, more of JPMorgan Chase’s customers may become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the Firm which, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provisions for credit losses, or in requirements that the Firm purchase assets from or provide other funding to its clients and counterparties, any of which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition. Moreover, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firm’s counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating the Firm’s credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (including mark-to-market losses) that the Firm could incur in its market-making and clearing businesses.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk and, in some cases, disputes and litigation in the event of a default by the counterparty or client.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with obligors as to the valuation of collateral significantly increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Periods of illiquidity could produce losses if the Firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful.In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firm’s inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase   13Part Ithe level of risk-weighted assets on the Firm’s balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firm’s businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s role as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase business exposes it to credit risks, including intra-day credit risk.The Firm is a market leader in providing clearing, custodial and prime brokerage services for financial services companies. In addition, the Firm acts as a clearing and custody bank in the U.S. tri-party repurchase transaction market. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client and, in the case of its role in the U.S. tri-party repurchase business, can expose the Firm to intra-day credit risk of the cash borrowers, usually broker-dealers; however, this exposure is secured by collateral and typically extinguished through the settlement process by the end of the day. The Firm actively participated in the Tri-Party Repo Infrastructure Reform Task Force sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which issued recommendations to modify and improve the infrastructure of tri-party repurchase transactions in order to, among other things, mitigate intra-day credit exposure. The Firm has implemented many of the recommendations and intends to implement the intra-day credit recommendations by the end of 2013. As a result, the Firm expects its intra-day credit exposure after implementation of all the Task Force recommendations to be substantially reduced. Nevertheless, if a broker-dealer that is party to a repurchase transaction cleared by the Firm becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may become involved in disputes and litigation with the broker-dealer’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors, or involved in regulatory investigations, all of which can increase the Firm’s operational and litigation costs and may result in losses if the securities in the repurchase transaction decline in value.Liquidity RiskIf JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (“SPEs”) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card  receivables and other assets, and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future.If the Firm’s access to stable and low cost sources of funding, such as bank deposits, are reduced, the Firm may need to raise alternative funding which may be more expensive or of limited availability.As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s principal subsidiaries are subject to dividend distribution or capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase & Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position.Some regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in countries in which they operate, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder the Firm’s ability to efficiently manage its funding and liquidity in a centralized manner.Reductions in the Firm’s credit ratings may adversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding, as well as the value of debt obligations issued by the Firm.JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., are currently rated by credit rating agencies. In 2012, Moody’s and Fitch downgraded the ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co. In addition, as of year-end 2012, Moody’s had JPMorgan Chase & Co., and S&P had JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain other subsidiaries, on “negative” outlook, indicating the possibility of a further downgrade in ratings. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future. For example, the rating agencies, have indicated that further control failures by the Firm (such as was evidenced in the Chief Investment Office (“CIO”) matter discussed below), deterioration in capital, liquidity and asset quality levels, or a significant increase in risk appetite could put downward pressure on the Firm’s ratings. Additionally, the rating agencies have indicated that they intend to re-evaluate the credit ratings of systemically important financial institutions in light of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that seek to eliminate any implicit government support for such institutions.Furthermore, the rating agencies continue to evaluate economic and geopolitical trends, including sovereign creditworthiness, elevated economic uncertainty and higher funding spreads, all of which could lead to downgrades in the credit ratings of global banks, including the Firm. There is no assurance that any such downgrades from rating agencies, if they affected the Firm’s credit ratings, would not occur at times of broader market instability when the 14  Firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.Further, a reduction in the Firm’s credit ratings could reduce the Firm’s access to debt markets, materially increase the cost of issuing debt, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability. In addition, any such reduction in credit ratings may increase the credit spreads charged by the market for taking credit risk on JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries and, as a result, could adversely affect the value of debt obligations that they have issued or may issue in the future.Legal RiskJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially adversely affect the Firm’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations.The Firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations or enforcement actions. In 2012, the Firm was the subject of Consent Orders from its banking regulators and entered into a global settlement with federal and state governmental agencies relating to its mortgage servicing and origination activities. In January 2013, the Firm also entered into Consent Orders with its banking regulators related to risk management, model governance and other control functions related to CIO and certain other trading activities at the Firm and with respect to the Firm’s and certain of its bank subsidiaries’ policies, procedures and controls relating to compliance with BSA and AML requirements. As the regulators continue to examine the operations of the Firm and its bank subsidiaries, there is no assurance that additional consent orders or other enforcement actions will not be issued by them in the future. These and other initiatives from federal and state officials may subject the Firm to further judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firm’s revenue. Business and Operational RisksJPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary and political developments in the United States and around the world.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the United States and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies) are beyond the Firm’s control and, consequently, the impact of changes in these policies on the Firm’s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.The Firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, in the countries in which such companies operate, as well as the other risks and considerations as described further below.Several of the Firm’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations.Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to those countries or regions. As noted above, concerns regarding the fiscal condition of certain countries within the Eurozone continue and there is no assurance such concerns will not lead to “market contagion” beyond those countries in the Eurozone or beyond the Eurozone. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations, will adversely affect the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s international growth strategy may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks.JPMorgan Chase has expanded, and plans to continue to grow, its international wholesale businesses in Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”), Asia/Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean. As part of its international growth strategy, the Firm seeks to provide a wider range of   15Part Ifinancial services to its clients that conduct business in those regions and to expand its international operations.Many of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase intends to grow its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the United States and other developed markets in which the Firm currently operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest, general strikes and demonstrations, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firm’s operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in countries or regions in which the Firm seeks to expand its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations, and there can be no assurance that the Firm will be able to successfully execute its international growth initiatives.Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firm’s operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions.Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations, as well as due to governmental actions including expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected the Firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firm’s operations in the United States. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions  or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firm’s business and results of operations.Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that the Firm will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring its operations outside the United States to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnity obligations.In connection with the sale and securitization of loans (whether with or without recourse), the originator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized. JPMorgan Chase and some of its subsidiaries have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans, and the Firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it has originated. If a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized, the Firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated loss directly, or the Firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses. Since 2010, the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to U.S. government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”), such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have been elevated, and there is no assurance that such costs will not continue to be elevated in the future. Accordingly, repurchase or indemnity obligations to the GSEs or to private third-party purchasers could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s results of operations and earnings in the future.The repurchase liability that the Firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations to the GSEs is estimated based on several factors, including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by purchasers, the Firm’s ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchases demands, the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure, the Firm’s potential ability to recover certain losses from third-party originators, and the terms of agreements with certain mortgage insurers and other parties. While the Firm believes that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to above are subject to change based on the GSEs’ future behavior, the economic environment and other uncertainties. Accordingly, there is no assurance that such reserves will not be increased in the future.The Firm also faces litigation related to securitizations, primarily related to securitizations not sold to the GSEs. The 16  Firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves. While the Firm believes that its current reserves in respect of such litigation matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future.JPMorgan Chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirements relating to mortgage servicing and foreclosures.The Firm has, as described above, entered into the Consent Orders with its banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities, and agreed to the global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The Firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to enhance its mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure procedures, including the enhancements required under the Consent Orders and the global settlement. In addition, the GSEs impose compensatory fees on their mortgage servicers, including the Firm, if such servicers are unable to comply with the foreclosure timetables mandated by the GSEs, and such fees may continue to be imposed on the Firm in the future.JPMorgan Chase’s commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the Firm to significant cost and liability.JPMorgan Chase engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. The Firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result of all of these activities, the Firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. The Firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity, and to restrict some of the Firm’s activities, which could result in lower revenues from the Firm’s commodities activities. In addition, the Firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore, liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations.The Firm’s commodities activities also further expose the Firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to the Firm’s reputation and suspension of operations. The Firm’s commodities activities are also subject to disruptions, many  of which are outside of the Firm’s control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. The Firm’s actions to mitigate its risks related to the above-mentioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.JPMorgan Chase relies on its systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect the Firm’s operations.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the Firm’s ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. If the Firm’s financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firm’s operations or systems. Third parties with which the Firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties. In addition, as the Firm changes processes or introduces new products and services, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially adversely affect the Firm.If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Firm’s systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firm’s control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or   17Part Itelecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firm’s property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. JPMorgan Chase maintains a global resiliency and crisis management program that is intended to ensure that the Firm has the ability to recover its critical business functions and supporting assets, including staff, technology and facilities, in the event of a business interruption. While the Firm believes that its current resiliency plans are both sufficient and adequate, there can be no assurance that such plans will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risks to the Firm. Any failures or disruptions of the Firm’s systems or operations could give rise to losses in service to customers and clients, adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations by subjecting the Firm to losses or liability, or require the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the failure or disruption, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm.Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers, there is no assurance that all of the Firm’s security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. The Firm and several other U.S. financial institutions have also experienced several significant distributed denial-of-service attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties which were intended to disrupt consumer online banking services.Despite the Firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also  attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firm’s data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firm’s systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firm’s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firm’s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Firm’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated.JPMorgan Chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring other businesses. There can be no assurance that the Firm’s acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of the combined entity; or an improved price for JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s common stock. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Firm’s operations or results. The Firm cannot provide assurance that any such integration efforts would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses.Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the Firm to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the Firm’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect the Firm’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and other business partners. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect the Firm’s ability to successfully conduct its business.Risk ManagementJPMorgan Chase’s framework for managing risks and its risk management procedures and practices may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market 18  risk, interest rate risk, country risk, principal risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Firm’s risk management framework proves ineffective, the Firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As the Firm’s businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve, the Firm’s risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. As a result, there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.The Firm’s products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, as well as cash management and clearing activities, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nation’s largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its credit exposure, including unfunded lending commitments. The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firm’s financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.JPMorgan Chase’s market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations  within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products.Many of the Firm’s risk management strategies or techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the Firm’s risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. The Firm cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework, including the Firm’s underlying assumptions or strategies, will at all times be accurate and effective.In connection with the Firm’s internal review of the reported losses in the synthetic credit portfolio managed by CIO, management concluded that during the first quarter of 2012 CIO’s risk management had been ineffective in dealing with the growth in the size and complexity of the portfolio during the first quarter of 2012. Among other matters, the Firm’s internal review found that CIO lacked a robust risk committee structure; that CIO’s risk limits were insufficiently granular and should have been reassessed in light of the positions being added to the synthetic credit portfolio in the first quarter of 2012; that CIO risk management was insufficiently engaged in the approval and implementation during the first quarter of 2012 of a new CIO Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) model related to the portfolio (before that model was discontinued and the previous model was restored); and that there was inadequate escalation to the Firm’s management of certain risk issues relating to the portfolio. The Firm has taken steps to correct such lapses, including, among other things, appointing a new Chief Risk Officer for CIO/Treasury/Corporate (“CTC”); adding resources and talent in CIO risk management; instituting new CTC risk committees to improve governance and controls and ensure tighter linkages between CIO, Treasury and other activities in the Corporate sector; and introducing more granular risk limits for CIO.  19Part IIn January 2013, JPMorgan Chase & Co. entered into a Consent Order with the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a Consent Order with the OCC relating to the banking regulators’ reviews of the CIO matter. These Consent Orders relate to risk management, model governance and other control functions related to CIO and certain other trading activities at the Firm. Many of the actions required by the Consent Orders have already been, or are in the process of being, implemented by the Firm.While the Firm has taken, and is taking, steps to correct the lapses in the CIO risk management framework, there is no assurance that new or additional lapses in the Firm’s risk management framework and governance structure could not occur in the future. Any such lapses or other inadequacies in the design or implementation of the Firm’s risk management framework, governance, procedures or practices could, individually or in the aggregate, cause unexpected losses for the Firm, materially and adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations, require significant resources to remediate any risk management deficiency, attract heightened regulatory scrutiny, expose the Firm to regulatory investigations or legal proceedings, subject the Firm to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.Lapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s operations, profitability or reputation.The Firm is committed to maintaining high standards of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Nevertheless, in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time. On July 13, 2012, the Firm reported that it had determined that a material weakness existed in its internal control over financial reporting at March 31, 2012. This determination related to the valuation control function for the synthetic credit portfolio managed by CIO during the first quarter of 2012. As a result of the material weakness, management also concluded that the Firm’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at March 31, 2012. Management has taken steps to remediate the internal control deficiency, including enhancing management supervision of valuation matters. The control deficiency was substantially remediated by June 30, 2012, and was closed-out by September 30, 2012.There can be no assurance that the Firm’s disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in the future or that a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting could not occur again. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Firm to expend significant resources to  correct the lapses or deficiencies, expose the Firm to regulatory or legal proceedings, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm the Firm’s reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.Other RisksThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the Firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as the financial services industry produces better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices.Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. The Firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firm’s products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations.Competitors of the Firm’s non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. For example, the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule and the derivatives “push-out” rules, have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the United States and may not be implemented into law in most countries. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including 20  prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, making the Firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firm’s cost structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firm’s wholesale businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Firm’s performance.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are the Firm’s most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Firm or its employees of restrictions on executive compensation may adversely affect the Firm’s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Firm’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigation, among other items. Certain of the Firm’s financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firm’s financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firm’s financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses.Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could damage its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firm’s business and prospects. Harm to the Firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or  perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to the Firm’s reputation. Adverse publicity regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firm’s prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firm’s reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firm’s reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firm’s earnings and results of operations.Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firm’s clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm"
16,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2012-02-29,": RISK FACTORSThe following discussion sets forth the material risk factors that could affect JPMorgan Chase’s financial condition and operations. Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect the Firm.Regulatory RiskJPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry, and the Firm’s businesses and results are significantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject.As a global financial services firm, JPMorgan Chase is subject to extensive and comprehensive regulation under state and federal laws in the United States and the laws of the various jurisdictions outside the United States in which the Firm does business. These laws and regulations significantly affect the way that the Firm does business, and can restrict the scope of its existing businesses and limit its ability to expand its product offerings or to pursue acquisitions, or can make its products and services more expensive for clients and customers.The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Firm’s businesses, operations and earnings remains uncertain because of the extensive rule-making still to be completed.The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, significantly increases the regulation of the financial services industry. For further information, see Supervision and regulation on pages 1–7.The U.S. Department of the Treasury, the FSOC, the SEC, the CFTC, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the CFPB and the FDIC are engaged in extensive rule-making mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, and much of the rule-making remains to be done. As a result, the complete impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Firm remains uncertain. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and such rule-making are discussed in more detail below.Debit interchange. The Firm believes that, as a result of the Durbin Amendment, its annualized net income may be reduced by approximately $600 million per year. Although the Firm continues to consider various actions that it may  take to mitigate this anticipated reduction in net income, it is unlikely that any such actions would wholly offset such reduction.Volcker Rule. Until the final regulations under the Volcker Rule are adopted, the precise definition of prohibited “proprietary trading”, the scope of any exceptions for market making and hedging, and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund activities remains uncertain. It is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of the Firm’s market-making and risk mitigation activities, as currently conducted, will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected. In addition, the rules, if enacted as proposed, would prohibit certain securitization structures and would bar U.S. banking entities from sponsoring or investing in certain non-U.S. funds. Also, with respect to certain of the Firm’s investments in illiquid private equity funds, should regulators not exercise their authority to permit the Firm to hold such investments beyond the minimum statutory divestment period, the Firm could incur substantial losses when it disposes of such investments, as it may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating their investments at the same time.Derivatives. In addition to imposing comprehensive regulation on the Firm’s derivatives businesses, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires banking entities, such as JPMorgan Chase, to significantly restructure their derivatives businesses, including changing the legal entities through which such businesses are conducted. Further, the proposed margin rules for uncleared swaps may apply extraterritorially to U.S. firms doing business with clients outside of the United States. Clients of non-U.S. firms doing business outside the United States would not be required to post margin in similar transactions. If these margin rules become final as currently drafted, JPMorgan Chase could be at a significant competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on the earnings and profitability of the Firm’s wholesale businesses.Heightened prudential standards for systemically important financial institutions. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, JPMorgan Chase is considered a systemically important financial institution and is subject to the heightened standards and supervision prescribed by the Act. If the proposed rules that were issued on December 20, 2011 are adopted as currently proposed, they are likely to increase the Firm’s operational, compliance and risk management costs, and could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations or financial condition.CFPB. Although the Firm is unable to predict what specific measures the CFPB may take in applying its regulatory mandate, any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses   7Part Iand result in increased compliance costs and impair the profitability of such businesses. In addition, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act’s potential expansion of the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation, the Firm could potentially be subject to additional state lawsuits and enforcement actions, thereby further increasing its legal and compliance costs.Resolution and Recovery. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve have issued a final rule that will require the Firm to submit periodically to the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the FSOC a resolution plan under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material financial distress or failure (a “resolution plan”). In 2012, the FDIC also issued a final rule that will require the Firm to submit periodic contingency plans to the FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act outlining its resolution plan in the event of its failure. The Firm’s initial resolution plan submissions are due on July 1, 2012, with annual updates thereafter, and the Firm is in the process of developing its resolution plans. If the FDIC and the Federal Reserve determine that the Firm’s resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on the growth, activities or operations of the Firm, or require the Firm to restructure, reorganize or divest certain assets or operations in order to facilitate an orderly resolution. Any such measures, particularly those aimed at the disaggregation of the Firm, may increase the Firm’s systems, technology and managerial costs, reduce the Firm’s capital, lessen efficiencies and economies of scale and potentially impede the Firm’s business strategies.Elimination of Use of External Credit Ratings. In December 2011, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC issued proposed rules for risk-based capital guidelines which would eliminate the use of external credit ratings for the calculation of risk-weighted assets. If the rules become final as currently proposed, they would result in a significant increase in the calculation of the Firm’s risk-weighted assets, which could require the Firm to hold more capital, increase its cost of doing business and place the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. competitors.Concentration Limits. The Dodd-Frank Act restricts acquisitions by financial companies if, as a result of the acquisition, the total liabilities of the financial company would exceed 10% of the total liabilities of all financial companies. The Federal Reserve is expected to issue rules related to these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2012. This concentration limit could restrict the Firm’s ability to make acquisitions in the future, thereby adversely affecting its growth prospects.The total impact of the Dodd-Frank Act cannot be fully assessed without taking into consideration how non-U.S. policymakers and regulators will respond to the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing regulations under the Act, and how the cumulative effects of both U.S. and non-U.S. laws  and regulations will affect the businesses and operations of the Firm. Additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States, the EU or in other countries could result in a significant loss of revenue for the Firm, limit the Firm’s ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that the Firm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products, impose additional costs on the Firm, or otherwise adversely affect the Firm’s businesses. Accordingly, any such new or additional legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations or financial condition.The Basel III capital standards will impose additional capital, liquidity and other requirements on the Firm that could decrease its competitiveness and profitability.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) announced in December 2010 revisions to its Capital Accord (commonly referred to as “Basel III”), which will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks, narrow the definition of capital, expand the definition of risk-weighted assets, and introduce short-term liquidity and term funding standards, among other things.Capital Surcharge. In June 2011, the Basel Committee and the FSB proposed that GSIBs be required to maintain additional capital above the Basel III Tier 1 common equity minimum. See page 2 in Item 1: Business for further information on the proposed capital change. Based on the Firm’s current understanding of these new capital requirements, the Firm expects that it will be in compliance with all of the standards to which it will be subject as they become effective. However, compliance with these capital standards may adversely affect the Firm’s operational costs, reduce its return on equity, or cause the Firm to alter the types of products it offers to its customers and clients, thereby causing the Firm’s products to become less attractive or placing the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to financial institutions, both within and outside the United States, that are not subject to the same capital surcharge.Liquidity Coverage and Net Stable Funding Ratios. The Basel Committee has also proposed two new measures of liquidity risk: the “liquidity coverage ratio” and the “net stable funding ratio,” which are intended to measure, over different time spans, the amount of the liquid assets held by the Firm. If the ratios are finalized as currently proposed, the Firm may need, in order to be in compliance with such ratios, to incur additional costs to raise liquidity from sources that are more expensive than its current funding sources and may need to take certain mitigating actions, such as ceasing to offer certain products to its customers and clients or charging higher fees for extending certain lines of credit. Accordingly, compliance with these liquidity coverage standards could adversely affect the Firm’s funding costs or reduce its profitability in the future.8  Non-U.S. regulations and initiatives may be inconsistent or may conflict with current or proposed regulations in the United States, which could create increased compliance and other costs and adversely affect the Firm’s businesses, operations or financial conditions.The EU has created a European Systemic Risk Board to monitor financial stability, and the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (“G-20”) broadened the membership and scope of the Financial Stability Forum in 2008 to form the FSB. These institutions, which are charged with developing ways to promote cross-border financial stability, are considering various proposals to address risks associated with global financial institutions. Some of the initiatives adopted include increased capital requirements for certain trading instruments or exposures and compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries. In the U.K., regulators have increased liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of non-U.K. bank holding companies and branches of non-U.K. banks located in the U.K.; adopted a Bank Tax Levy that applies to balance sheets of branches and subsidiaries of non-U.K. banks; and proposed the creation of resolution and recovery plans by U.K. regulated entities, among other initiatives.The regulatory schemes and requirements that are being proposed by various regulators around the world may be inconsistent or conflict with regulations to which the Firm is subject in the United States (as well as in other parts of the world), thereby subjecting the Firm to higher compliance and legal costs, as well as the possibility of higher operational, capital and liquidity costs, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Firm’s business, results of operations and profitability in the future.Expanded regulatory oversight of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses will increase the Firm’s compliance costs and risks and may negatively affect the profitability of such businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to its compliance under consumer laws and regulations, including changes implemented as a part of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Firm has entered into Consent Orders with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities. The Consent Orders require significant changes to the Firm’s servicing and default business; the submission and implementation of a comprehensive action plan setting forth the steps necessary to ensure the Firm’s residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities are conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Consent Orders; and other remedial actions that the Firm has undertaken to ensure that it satisfies all requirements of the Consent Orders. The Firm also agreed in February 2012 to a settlement in principle with a number of federal and state government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the CFPB and the State Attorneys General, relating to the servicing and origination of  mortgages. This global settlement requires the Firm to make cash payments and provide certain refinancing and other borrower relief, as well as to adhere to certain enhanced mortgage servicing standards. For further information, see “Subsequent events” in Note 2 on page 184, and Mortgage Foreclosure Investigations and Litigation in Note 31 on pages 295–296.In addition, any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements that the CFPB may promulgate could require changes in the product offerings and practices of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses.Finally, as a result of increasing federal and state scrutiny ofthe Firm’s consumer practices, the Firm may face a greaternumber or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actionsand litigation in the future, thereby increasing its costsassociated with responding to or defending such actions. Inaddition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, aswell as any additional legislative or regulatory developmentsaffecting the Firm’s consumer businesses, and any requiredchanges to the Firm’s business operations resulting fromthese developments, could result in significant loss ofrevenue, limit the products or services the Firm offers, requirethe Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demandfor its products, impose additional compliance costs on theFirm, cause harm to the Firm’s reputation or otherwiseadversely affect the Firm’s consumer businesses. In addition,if the Firm does not appropriately comply with current orfuture legislation and regulations that apply to its consumeroperations, the Firm may be subject to fines, penalties orjudgments, or material regulatory restrictions on itsbusinesses, which could adversely affect the Firm’s operationsand, in turn, its financial results.Market RiskJPMorgan Chase’s results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, including the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices; investor sentiment; events that reduce confidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism; and the health of U.S. or international economies.In the Firm’s wholesale businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect transactions involving the Firm’s underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from its private equity business; the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its customers and, therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from commissions and spreads; and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by the Firm.  9Part IThe Firm generally maintains extensive positions in the fixed income, currency, commodities and equity markets to facilitate client demand and provide liquidity to clients. From time to time the Firm may have market-making positions that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including the Firm’s success in effectively hedging its market and other risks, volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets, credit spreads, and availability of liquidity in the capital markets, all of which are affected by economic and market conditions. The Firm anticipates that revenue relating to its market-making and private equity businesses will continue to experience volatility, which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such activities, and that this could materially adversely affect the Firm’s earnings.The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in securities markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm manages or holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firm’s revenue. Macroeconomic or market concerns may also prompt outflows from the Firm’s funds or accounts.Changes in interest rates will affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Firm’s balance sheet and the revenue the Firm earns from net interest income. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of the Firm’s businesses by compressing net interest margins, reducing the amounts the Firm earns on its investment securities portfolio, or reducing the value of its mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) asset, thereby reducing the Firm’s net interest income and other revenues.The Firm’s consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions, including U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. Any further deterioration in current economic conditions, or the failure of the economy to rebound in the near term, could diminish demand for the products and services of the Firm’s consumer businesses, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions, such as continuing declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to an increase in mortgage, credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can reduce the Firm’s earnings.Widening of credit spreads makes it more expensive for the Firm to borrow on both a secured and unsecured basis. Credit spreads widen or narrow not only in response to Firm-specific events and circumstances, but also as a result of general economic and geopolitical events and conditions. Changes in the Firm’s credit spreads will impact, positively or negatively, the Firm’s earnings on liabilities that are recorded at fair value. The outcome of the EU sovereign debt crisis could have adverse effects on the Firm’s businesses, operations and earnings.Despite various assistance packages and facilities for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, it is not possible to predict how markets will react if one or more of these countries were to default, and such a default, if it were to occur, could lead to “market contagion” in other Eurozone countries and thereby adversely affect the market value of securities and other obligations held by the Firm’s IB, AM, TSS and CIO businesses. In addition, the departure of any Eurozone country from the Euro could lead to serious foreign exchange, operational and settlement disruptions, which, in turn, may have a negative impact on the Firm’s operations and businesses.Credit RiskThe financial condition of JPMorgan Chase’s customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm.If the current economic environment were to deteriorate further, or not rebound in the near term, more of JPMorgan Chase’s customers may become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the Firm which, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provisions for credit losses, or in requirements that the Firm purchase assets from or provide other funding to its clients and counterparties, any of which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition. Moreover, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firm’s counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating the Firm’s credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (including mark-to-market losses) that the Firm could incur in its market-making and clearing businesses.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of market-making, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to credit risk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client. The Firm is a market leader in providing clearing, custodial and prime brokerage services for financial services companies. When such a client of the Firm becomes bankrupt or insolvent, the Firm may become entangled in significant disputes and litigation with the client’s bankruptcy estate and other creditors or involved in regulatory investigations, all of which can increase the Firm’s operational and litigation costs.During periods of market stress or illiquidity, the Firm’s credit risk also may be further increased when the Firm cannot realize the fair value of the collateral held by it or when collateral is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due to the Firm. Further, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly 10  increase in times of market stress and illiquidity. Periods of illiquidity, as experienced in 2008 and early 2009, may occur again and could produce losses if the Firm is unable to realize the fair value of collateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similar business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of its portfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firm’s efforts to diversify or hedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful.In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firm’s inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. The inability to reduce the Firm’s positions may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firm’s balance sheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adversely affect the operations and profitability of the Firm’s businesses.Liquidity RiskIf JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer.JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potential conditions that could impair the Firm’s liquidity include markets that become illiquid or are otherwise experiencing disruption, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (“SPEs”) or other entities), difficulty in selling or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be caused by events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investor confidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased the Firm’s cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets, and there is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future.Bank deposits are a stable and low cost source of funding. If the Firm does not successfully attract deposits (because, for example, competitors raise the interest rates that they are willing to pay to depositors, and accordingly, customers move their deposits elsewhere), the Firm may need to replace such funding with more expensive funding, which would reduce the Firm’s net interest margin and net interest income. Debt obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and certain of their subsidiaries are currently rated by credit rating agencies. These credit ratings are important to maintaining the Firm’s liquidity. A reduction in these credit ratings could reduce the Firm’s access to debt markets or materially increase the cost of issuing debt, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing or permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, thereby curtailing the Firm’s business operations and reducing its profitability. Reduction in the ratings of certain SPEs or other entities to which the Firm has funding or other commitments could also impair the Firm’s liquidity where such ratings changes lead, directly or indirectly, to the Firm being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding.Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, leading market shares, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Although the Firm closely monitors and manages factors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered in the future. For example, the rating agencies have indicated they intend to re-evaluate the credit ratings of systemically important financial institutions in light of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that seek to eliminate any implicit government support for such institutions. In addition, several rating agencies have indicated that recent economic and geopolitical trends, including deteriorating sovereign creditworthiness (particularly in the Eurozone), elevated economic uncertainty and higher funding spreads, could lead to downgrades in the credit ratings of many global banks, including the Firm. Any such downgrades from rating agencies, if they affected the Firm’s credit ratings, may occur at times of broader market instability when the Firm’s options for responding to events may be more limited and general investor confidence is low.As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments that JPMorgan Chase & Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidity position.Some global regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks to incorporate a separate subsidiary in every country in which they operate, and to maintain independent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements could hinder the Firm’s ability to manage its liquidity efficiently.  11Part ILegal RiskJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future, particularly with respect to litigation related to the issuance or underwriting by the Firm of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”). Actions currently pending against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially adversely affect the Firm’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation related to its businesses and operations.The Firm’s businesses and operations are also subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to additional regulatory investigations. For example, in January 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice, the New York State Attorney General, the Secretary for Housing and Urban Development and the SEC announced the formation of the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group to investigate “those responsible for misconduct contributing to the financial crisis” through the pooling and sale of residential MBS. These and other initiatives from state and federal officials may subject the Firm to additional judgments, settlements, fines or penalties, or cause the Firm to be required to restructure its operations and activities, all of which could lead to reputational issues, or higher operational costs, thereby reducing the Firm’s revenue.Business and Operational RisksJPMorgan Chase’s results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnity obligations.In connection with the sale and securitization of loans (whether with or without recourse), the originator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized. JPMorgan Chase and some of its subsidiaries have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale and securitization of loans, and the Firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it has originated. If a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold or securitized, the Firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated loss directly, or the Firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses. In 2010 and 2011, the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to U.S. government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”), such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, continued to be elevated, and there is no assurance that such costs will not continue to be elevated in the future. Accordingly, repurchase or indemnity obligations  to the GSEs or to private third-party purchasers could materially and adversely affect the Firm’s results of operations and earnings in the future.The repurchase liability that the Firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations is estimated based on several factors, including the level of current and estimated probable future repurchase demands made by purchasers, the Firm’s ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchases demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure. While the Firm believes that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to above are subject to change in light of market developments, the economic environment and other circumstances. Accordingly, such reserves may be increased in the future.The Firm also faces litigation related to securitizations, primarily related to securitizations not sold to the GSEs. The Firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing its litigation reserves. While the Firm believes that its current reserves in respect of such litigation matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to be increased in the future.JPMorgan Chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirements relating to mortgage foreclosures.The Firm has, as described above, entered into the Consent Orders with banking regulators relating to its residential mortgage servicing, foreclosure and loss-mitigation activities, and agreed to the global settlement with federal and state government agencies relating to the servicing and origination of mortgages. The Firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to enhance its mortgage origination, servicing and foreclosure procedures, including the enhancements required under the Consent Orders and the global settlement.JPMorgan Chase’s commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the Firm to significant cost and liability.JPMorgan Chase engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. The Firm is also engaged in power generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result of all of these activities, the Firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. The Firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity, and to restrict some of the Firm’s activities, which could result in lower revenues from the Firm’s commodities activities. In addition, the Firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with these 12  laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore, liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediation of contaminations.The Firm’s commodities activities also further expose the Firm to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to the Firm’s reputation and suspension of operations. The Firm’s commodities activities are also subject to disruptions, many of which are outside of the Firm’s control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. The Firm’s actions to mitigate its risks related to the above-mentioned considerations may not prove adequate to address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.JPMorgan Chase relies on its systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affect the Firm’s operations.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the Firm’s ability to process, record and monitor a large number of complex transactions. If the Firm’s financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if one or more of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firm’s operations or systems. Third parties with which the Firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties’ own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firm’s ability to operate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, increased operating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materially adversely affect the Firm.If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firm’s possession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include  circumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either through the fault of the Firm’s systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond the Firm’s control, which may include, for example, security breaches (as discussed further below); electrical or telecommunications outages; failures of computer servers or other damage to the Firm’s property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the Firm.In a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time, and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future. As processes are changed, or new products and services are introduced, the Firm may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. In addition, there is the risk that the Firm’s controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems could prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could adversely affect the Firm’s business and results of operations by requiring the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.A breach in the security of JPMorgan Chase’s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Firm.Although JPMorgan Chase devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade its systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of the Firm’s computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the Firm and its customers, there is no assurance that all of the Firm’s security measures will provide absolute security. JPMorgan Chase and other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks and other means. Despite the Firm’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, it is possible that the Firm may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types,   13Part Iespecially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties outside the Firm such as persons involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Firm’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Firm’s data or that of its customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as the Firm continues to increase its mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expands its internal usage of web-based products and applications.A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Firm’s systems could cause serious negative consequences for the Firm, including significant disruption of the Firm’s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Firm or that of its customers, or damage to computers or systems of the Firm and those of its customers and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Firm or to its customers, loss of confidence in the Firm’s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to the Firm’s reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s international growth strategy may be hindered by local political, social and economic factors, and will be subject to additional compliance costs and risks.JPMorgan Chase has expanded, and plans to continue to grow, its international wholesale businesses in Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”), Asia/Pacific and Latin America/Caribbean. As part of its international growth strategy, the Firm seeks to provide a wider range of financial services, including cash management, lending, trade finance and corporate advisory services, to its clients that conduct business in those regions. In furtherance of these initiatives, the Firm is selectively expanding its existing international operations, including through the addition of client-serving bankers and product and sales support personnel.Many of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase intends to grow its wholesale businesses have economies or markets that are less developed and more volatile, and may have legal and regulatory regimes that are less established or predictable, than the United States and other developed markets in which the Firm operates. Some of these countries have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions, or have imposed restrictive monetary policies such as currency exchange controls and other laws and restrictions that adversely affect the local and regional business environment. In addition, these countries have historically been more susceptible to unfavorable political, social or economic developments which have in the past resulted in, and may in the future lead to, social unrest,  general strikes and demonstrations, outbreaks of hostilities, overthrow of incumbent governments, terrorist attacks or other forms of internal discord, all of which can adversely affect the Firm’s operations or investments in such countries. Political, social or economic disruption or dislocation in countries or regions in which the Firm seeks to expand its wholesale businesses can hinder the growth and profitability of those operations, and there can be no assurance that the Firm will be able to successfully execute its international growth initiatives.Less developed legal and regulatory systems in certain countries can also have adverse consequences on the Firm’s operations in those countries, including, among others, the absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or guidance for engaging in specific types of business or transactions, or the inconsistent application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations; uncertainty as to the enforceability of contractual obligations; difficulty in competing in economies in which the government controls or protects all or a portion of the local economy or specific businesses, or where graft or corruption may be pervasive; and the threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations, civil litigations or criminal prosecutions.Conducting business in countries with less developed legal and regulatory regimes often requires the Firm to devote significant additional resources to understanding, and monitoring changes in, local laws and regulations, as well as structuring its operations to comply with local laws and regulations and implementing and administering related internal policies and procedures. There can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will always be successful in its efforts to conduct its business in compliance with laws and regulations in countries with less predictable legal and regulatory systems. In addition, the Firm can also incur higher costs, and face greater compliance risks, in structuring its operations outside the United States to comply with U.S. anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations.JPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary, political, legal and other developments in the United States and around the world.JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing in the United States and the return earned on those loans and investments. Changes in Federal Reserve policies (as well as the fiscal and monetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies) are beyond the Firm’s control and, consequently, the impact of changes in these policies on the Firm’s activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.14  The Firm’s businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and market-making in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from unfavorable political, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, and changes in laws and regulations. Crime, corruption, war or military actions, acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in certain emerging markets.Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected the Firm’s operations and investments in another country or countries, including the Firm’s operations in the United States. As a result, any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firm’s business and results of operations.Several of the Firm’s businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firm’s financial condition and results of operations.Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to that country or region, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions. Concerns regarding the fiscal condition of certain countries within the Eurozone continue and there is no assurance such concerns will not lead to “market contagion” beyond those countries in the Eurozone or beyond the Eurozone. Accordingly, it is possible that economic disruptions in certain countries, even in countries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations, will adversely affect the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefits anticipated.JPMorgan Chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring other businesses. There can be no assurance that the Firm’s acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of the combined entity; or an improved  price for JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s common stock. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Firm’s operations or results. The Firm cannot provide assurance that any such integration efforts would not result in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses.Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the Firm to lose customers or cause customers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the Firm’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adversely affect the Firm’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and other business partners. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect the Firm’s ability to successfully conduct its business.Risk ManagementJPMorgan Chase’s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Firm.JPMorgan Chase’s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firm has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which the Firm is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, country risk, private equity risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firm’s risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Firm’s risk management framework proves ineffective, the Firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As the Firm’s businesses change and grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve, the Firm’s risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. As a result, there is the risk that the credit and market risks associated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firm’s risk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.The Firm’s products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nation’s largest lenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality of the Firm’s exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firm establishes allowances for probable credit losses that are inherent in its   15Part Icredit exposure (including unfunded lending commitments). The Firm also employs stress testing and other techniques to determine the capital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or market events. These processes are critical to the Firm’s financial results and condition, and require difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions might impair the ability of the Firm’s borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or other obligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that the Firm will fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that it identifies.JPMorgan Chase’s market-making businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit and operational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a financial instrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firm’s derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that the Firm does not own; if the Firm is unable to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays, which could damage the Firm’s reputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputes regarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivative contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, and impair the Firm’s ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products.Many of the Firm’s hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management’s subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the Firm’s risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. The Firm cannot provide assurance that its risk management framework, including the Firm’s underlying assumptions or strategies, will at all times be accurate and effective. Other RisksThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chase’s inability to compete successfully may adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the Firm expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued consolidation in the financial services industry produces larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices.Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. The Firm’s businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of the Firm’s products and services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firm’s products and services or may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that the significant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect its future results of operations.Competitors of the Firm’s non-U.S. wholesale businesses are typically subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes. For example, the regulatory objectives underlying several provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the prohibition on proprietary trading under the Volcker Rule, margin requirements for certain non-U.S. derivatives transactions and the derivatives “push-out” rules, have not been embraced by governments and regulatory agencies outside the United States and may not be implemented into law in most countries. The more restrictive laws and regulations applicable to U.S. financial services institutions, such as JPMorgan Chase, can put the Firm at a competitive disadvantage to its non-U.S. competitors, including prohibiting the Firm from engaging in certain transactions, making the Firm’s pricing of certain transactions more expensive for clients or adversely affecting the Firm’s cost 16  structure for providing certain products, all of which can reduce the revenue and profitability of the Firm’s wholesale businesses.JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Firm’s performance.JPMorgan Chase’s employees are the Firm’s most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on the Firm or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adversely affect the Firm’s ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If the Firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, the Firm’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase’s financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, JPMorgan Chase is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining allowances for credit losses, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related to litigations, among other items. Certain of the Firm’s financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firm’s financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firm’s financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses.Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation could damage its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firm’s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firm’s reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firm’s business and prospects. Harm to the Firm’s reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or regulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to deliver  appropriate standards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to reputation for the Firm. Adverse publicity regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firm’s prospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in the industry can also affect the Firm’s reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firms in the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have been treated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole. Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firm’s reputation occur, there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur to address the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firm’s earnings and results of operations.Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firm continues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among the Firm’s clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause serious reputational harm to the Firm"
3,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2011-02-28,"ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORSThe following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materiallyaffect JPMorgan Chases financial condition and operations. Other factors that could affect theFirms financial condition and operations are discussed in the Forward-looking statements sectionon page 157. However, factors besides those discussed below, in MD&A or elsewhere in this or otherreports that JPMorgan Chase filed or furnished with the SEC, also could adversely affect the Firm.Readers should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potentialrisks that could affect the Firm.JPMorgan Chases results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected byU.S. and international financial market and economic conditions.JPMorgan Chases businesses are materially affected by economic and market conditions, includingthe liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices,interest rates and currency and commodities prices;investor sentiment; events that reduceconfidence in the financial markets; inflation and unemployment; the availability and cost ofcapital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism; and the healthof U.S. or international economies.In the Firms wholesale businesses, the above-mentioned factors can affect transactions involvingthe Firms underwriting and advisory businesses; the realization of cash returns from its privateequity business; the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for its customers and,therefore, the revenue that the Firm receives from commissions and spreads; and the willingness offinancial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managedby the Firm.The Firm generally maintains large positions in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equitymarkets, and from time to time the Firm may have trading positions that lack pricing transparencyor liquidity. The revenue derived from these positions is affected by many factors, including theFirms success in effectively hedging its market and other risks, volatility in interest rates andequity, debt and commodities, markets credit spreads, and availability of liquidity in the capitalmarkets, all of which are affected by economic and market conditions. The Firm anticipates thatrevenue relating to its trading and private equity businesses will continue to experiencevolatility, which will affect pricing or the ability to realize returns from such investments, andthat this could materially adversely affect the Firms earnings.The fees that the Firm earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon generaleconomic conditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturnin securities markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets that the Firm managesor holds in custody, which, in turn, could affect the Firms revenue. Macroeconomic or marketconcerns may also prompt outflows from the Firms funds or accounts. Moreover, even in the absenceof a market downturn, sub-par performance by the Firms investment management businesses could cause outflows of assets undermanagement and, therefore, reduce the fees that the Firm receives.The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions, includingU.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence;changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies. Any deterioration in theseconditions can diminish demand for the products and services of the Firms consumer businesses, orincrease the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economic conditions,such as declines in home prices or persistent high levels of unemployment, could lead to anincrease in mortgage, credit card and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, whichcan reduce the Firms earnings.If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its business could suffer.JPMorgan Chases liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses. Some potentialconditions that could impair the Firms liquidity include markets that become illiquid or areotherwise disrupted, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including, among others, commitmentsthat may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities), difficulty inselling or5Table of ContentsPart Iinability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, and lack of marketor customer confidence in the Firm or financial markets in general. These conditions may be causedby events over which the Firm has little or no control. The widespread crisis in investorconfidence and resulting liquidity crisis experienced in 2008 and into early 2009 increased theFirms cost of funding and limited its access to some of its traditional sources of liquidity suchas securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, credit card receivables and other assets, andthere is no assurance that these conditions could not occur in the future.The credit ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. areimportant to maintaining the Firms liquidity. A reduction in their credit ratings could reduce theFirms access to debt markets or materially increase the cost of issuing debt, trigger additionalcollateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willingor permitted, contractually or otherwise, to do business with or lend to the Firm, therebycurtailing the Firms business operations and reducing its profitability. Reduction in the ratingsof certain SPEs or other entities to which the Firm has funding or other commitments could alsoimpair the Firms liquidity where such ratings changes lead, directly or indirectly, to the Firmbeing required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding.Critical factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream,strong capital ratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources,and disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures. Although the Firm closely monitors and managesfactors influencing its credit ratings, there is no assurance that such ratings will not be loweredin the future. Such downgrades may come at times of broader market instability, when the Firms options for responding to events are more limitedand general investor confidence is low.As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase & Co. relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cashflow and, consequently, its ability to pay dividends and satisfy its debt and other obligations.These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several ofJPMorgan Chase & Co.s principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or otherregulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations inthe payments that JPMorgan Chase & Co. receives from its subsidiaries could reduce its liquidityposition.Some global regulators have proposed legislation or regulations requiring large banks toincorporate a separate subsidiary in every country in which they operate, and to maintainindependent capital and liquidity for such subsidiaries. If adopted, these requirements coulddecrease the Firms ability to manage and increase the risk of its liquidity positions.JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry and the Firms business and results aresignificantly affected by the laws and regulations to which it is subject, includingrecently-adopted legislation and regulations.JPMorgan Chase is subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the United States, as wellas the applicable laws of eachof the various other jurisdictions outside the United States inwhich the Firm does business. These laws and regulations affect the way that the Firm doesbusiness, may restrict the scope of its existing businesses, limit its ability to expand itsproduct offerings or pursue acquisitions, or make offering its products to clients more expensive.Extensive legislation affecting the financial services industry has recently been adopted in theUnited States and in other jurisdictions, and regulations are in the process of being implemented.In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was adopted in2010 and will effect significant structural reforms to the financial services industry. Thislegislation provides for, among other things: the establishment of a Bureau of Consumer FinancialProtection which will have broad authority to regulate the credit, savings, payment and otherconsumer financial products and services that the Firm offers; the creation of a structure toregulate systemically important financial companies, and provide regulators with the power torequire such companies to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities if the regulatorsdetermine that the size or scope of activities of the company pose a threat to the safety andsoundness of the company or the financial stability of the United States; more comprehensiveregulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, including providing for higher capital andmargin requirements, the central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, andheightened supervision of all over-the-counter derivatives dealers and major market participants,including the Firm; so-called push out provisions that could require the Firm to significantlyrestructure or restrict its derivatives businesses, change the legal entities through which suchbusinesses are conducted, or limit the Firms ability to manage collateral, margin and other risks;prohibitions on the Firm engaging in certain proprietary trading activities and restricting its ownership of,investment in or sponsorship of, hedge funds and private equity funds; restrictions on theinterchange fees that the Firm earns on debit card transactions; and a requirement that bankregulators phase out the treatment of trust preferred capital debt securities as Tier 1 capital forregulatory capital purposes.The European Union (EU) has created a European Systemic Risk Board to monitor financial stabilityand implemented rules that will increase capital requirements for certain trading instruments orexposures and impose compensation limits on certain employees located in affected countries. Inaddition, the EU Commission is considering a wide array of other initiatives, including newlegislation that will affect derivatives trading, impose surcharges on globally systemicallyimportant firms and possibly impose new levies on bank balance sheets.The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced in December 2010 revisions to its CapitalAccord, which will require higher capital ratio requirements for banks, narrow the definition ofcapital, and introduce short term liquidity and term funding standards, among other things. Alsobeing considered is the imposition of a bank surcharge on institutions that are determined to beglobally significant financial institutions. These requirements could increase the Firms fundingand operational costs.6Table of ContentsThese and any additional legislative or regulatory actions in the United States or other countries, and anyrequired changes to the Firms business operations resulting from such legislation and regulations,could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the Firms ability to pursue businessopportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, affect the value of assets that theFirm holds, require the Firm to increase its prices and therefore reduce demand for its products,impose additional costs on the Firm, or otherwise adversely affect the Firms businesses.Accordingly, the Firm cannot provide assurance that any such new legislation or regulations wouldnot have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition in thefuture.If the Firm does not comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to itsoperations, the Firm may be subject to fines, penalties or material restrictions on its businessesin the jurisdiction where the violation occurred. In recent years, regulatory oversight andenforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potentialrisks associated with the Firms operations. As this regulatory trend continues, it could adverselyaffect the Firms operations and, in turn, its financial results.The financial condition of JPMorgan Chases customers, clients and counterparties, including otherfinancial institutions, could adversely affect the Firm.If the current economic environment were to deteriorate, more of JPMorgan Chases customers maybecome delinquent on their loans or other obligations to the Firm which, in turn, could result in ahigher level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, or in requirements that the Firmpurchase assets from or provide other funding to its clientsand counterparties, any of which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition. Moreover, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of the Firms counterparties could lead toconcerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry,thereby exacerbating the Firms credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses (includingmark-to-market losses) that the Firm could incur in its trading and clearing businesses.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, orother relationships. The Firm routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financialservices industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual andhedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Firm to creditrisk in the event of a default by the counterparty or client, which can be exacerbated duringperiods of market illiquidity. During such periods, the Firms credit risk also may be furtherincreased when the collateral held by the Firm cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at pricesthat are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan, derivative or other exposure due tothe Firm. In addition, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantlyincrease in times of market stress and illiquidity. Periods of illiquidity, as experienced in 2008and early 2009, may occur again and could produce losses if the Firm is unable to realize uponcollateral or manage declines in the value of collateral.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.JPMorgan Chase has exposure to increased levels of risk when customers are engaged in similarbusiness activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economicfeatures that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected bychanges in economic conditions. As a result, the Firm regularly monitors various segments of itsportfolio exposures to assess potential concentration risks. The Firms efforts to diversify orhedge its credit portfolio against concentration risks may not be successful.In addition, increased concentration within the Firms securities or loan portfolios, or in otherpositions that the Firm may hold, may occur for reasons outside of the Firms control. Disruptionsin the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in the Firms inability tosell, syndicate or realize upon its positions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. Theinability to reduce the Firms positions not only increases the market and credit risks associatedwith such positions, but also increases the level of risk-weighted assets on the Firms balancesheet, thereby increasing its capital requirements and funding costs, all of which could adverselyaffect the operations and profitability of the Firms businesses.JPMorgan Chases framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss tothe Firm.JPMorgan Chases risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. The Firmhas established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyzethe types of risk to which the Firm is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk,interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, reputational risk and privateequity risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherentlimitations to the Firms risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in thefuture, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Firms riskmanagement framework proves ineffective, the Firm could suffer unexpected losses and could bematerially adversely affected. As the Firms businesses change and grow and the markets in whichthey operate continue to evolve, the Firms risk management framework may not always keepsufficient pace with those changes. As a result, there is the risk that the credit and market risksassociated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified,monitored or managed. In addition, in a difficult or less liquid market environment, the Firmsrisk management strategies may not be effective because other market participants may be attemptingto use the same or similar strategies to deal with the challenging market conditions. In suchcircumstances, it may be difficult for the Firm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity ofsuch other market participants.The Firms products, including loans, leases, lending commitments, derivatives, trading accountassets and assets held-for-sale, expose the Firm to credit risk. As one of the nations largestlenders, the Firm has exposures arising from its many different products and counterparties, andthe credit quality of the Firms exposures can have a significant impact on its earnings. The Firmestablishes reserves for probable credit losses7Table of ContentsPart Iinherent in its credit exposure (including unfundedlending commitments). The Firm also employs stress testing and other methods to determine thecapital and liquidity necessary to protect the Firm in the event of adverse economic or marketevents. These processes are critical to the Firms financial results and condition, and requiredifficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economic conditions mightimpair the ability of the Firms borrowers and counterparties to repay their loans or otherobligations. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that the Firmwill fail to identify the proper factors or that the Firm will fail to accurately estimate theimpact of factors that it identifies.JPMorgan Chases trading businesses may expose the Firm to unexpected market, credit andoperational risks that could cause the Firm to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in assetvalues, unanticipated credit events, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previouslyuncorrelated factors to become correlated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risksnot appropriately taken into account in the development, structuring or pricing of a tradinginstrument such as a derivative. Certain of the Firms derivative transactions require the physicalsettlement by delivery of securities, commodities or obligations that the Firm does not own; if theFirm is unable to obtain such securities, commodities or obligations within the required timeframefor delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result insettlement delays, which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact futurebusiness. In addition, in situations where trades are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, the Firm may be subject to heightened credit and operational risk, and in the event of adefault, the Firm may be exposed to market and operational losses. In particular, disputesregarding the terms or the settlement procedures of derivatives contracts could arise, which couldforce the Firm to incur unexpected costs, including transaction, legal and litigation costs, andimpair the Firms ability to manage effectively its risk exposure from these products.Many of the Firms hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis inhistorical market behavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree onmanagements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based onassumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other marketindicators. In times of market stress, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances,previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlatedindicators may make unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated orunidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness ofthe Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. The Firm cannot provideassurance that its risk management framework, including the Firms underlying assumptions orstrategies, will at all times be accurate and effective.JPMorgan Chases operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary,political, legal and other developments in the United States and around the world.JPMorgan Chases businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that areadopted by various U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities and agencies. The Federal Reserve Boardregulates the supply of money and credit in the United States and its policies determine in largepart the cost of funds for lending and investing in the United States and the return earned onthose loans and investments. The market impact from such policies can also materially decrease thevalue of financial assets that the Firm holds, such as mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). FederalReserve Board policies also can adversely affect the Firms borrowers and counterparties,potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy theirobligations to the Firm. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies (as well as the fiscal andmonetary policies of non-U.S. central banks or regulatory authorities and agencies) are beyond theFirms control and, consequently, the impact of changes in these policies on the Firms activitiesand results of operations is difficult to predict.The Firms businesses and revenue are also subject to risks inherent in investing and trading insecurities of companies worldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from unfavorablepolitical, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, expropriation,nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, andchanges in laws and regulations. Crime, corruption, war or military actions, acts of terrorism anda lack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in certainemerging markets.Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities and other obligations maybe subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations. The impact of thesefluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and morevolatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in onecountry can, and has in the past, affected the Firms operations and investments in another countryor countries, including the Firms operations in the United States. As a result, any suchunfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on the Firms business andresults of operations.Several of the Firms businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obligations of, U.S. andnon-U.S. governmental entities, including national, state, provincial, municipal and localauthorities. These activities can expose the Firm to enhanced sovereign, credit-related,operational and reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental entity may default onor restructure its obligations or may claim that actions taken by government officials were beyondthe legal authority of those officials, which could adversely affect the Firms financial conditionand results of operations.Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which the Firm may do so inthe future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions particular to that country orregion, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, amongother negative conditions. In 2010, concerns were raised about certain European countries,including Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, regarding perceived weaknesses in theireconomic and fiscal8Table of Contentscondition, and how such weaknesses might affect other economies as well asfinancial institutions, including the Firm, which lent funds to or did business with or in thosecountries. There is always the chance that economic disruptions in other countries, even incountries in which the Firm does not conduct business or have operations, will adversely affect theFirm.JPMorgan Chases results of operations may be adversely affected by loan repurchase and indemnityobligations.In connection with the sale and securitization of loans (whether with or without recourse), theoriginator is generally required to make a variety of representations and warranties regarding boththe originator and the loans being sold or securitized. JPMorgan Chase and some of itssubsidiaries, including those acquired through the Bear Stearns merger and the Washington Mutualtransaction, have made such representations and warranties in connection with the sale andsecuritization of loans, and the Firm will continue to do so when it securitizes loans it hasoriginated. If a loan that does not comply with such representations or warranties is sold orsecuritized, the Firm may be obligated to repurchase the loan and incur any associated lossdirectly, or the Firm may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses. In 2010,the costs of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to government agencies such as FannieMae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs) increased substantially, and there is no assurance that such costscould not continue to increase substantially in the future. Accordingly, repurchase or indemnity obligations to the GSEs or to private third-party purchasers could materially andadversely affect the Firms results of operations and earnings in the future.The repurchase liability that the Firm records with respect to its loan repurchase obligations isestimated based on several factors, including the level of current and estimated probable futurerepurchase demands made by purchasers, the Firms ability to cure the defects identified in therepurchases demands, and the severity of loss upon repurchase or foreclosure. While the Firmbelieves that its current repurchase liability reserves are adequate, the factors referred to aboveare subject to change in light of market developments, the economic environment and othercircumstances. Accordingly, such reserves may be increased in the future.The Firm also faces litigation related to securitizations, primarily related to securitizations notsold to the GSEs. The Firm separately evaluates its exposure to such litigation in establishing itslitigation reserves. While the Firm believes that its current reserves in respect of suchlitigation matters are adequate, there can be no assurance that such reserves will not need to beincreased in the future.JPMorgan Chase may incur additional costs and expenses in ensuring that it satisfies requirementsrelating to mortgage foreclosures.In late September 2010, JPMorgan Chase commenced implementation of a temporary suspension ofobtaining mortgage foreclosure judgments in the states and territories that require a judicialforeclosure process. Subsequently, the Firm extended this temporary suspension to foreclosure salesin those states and territories that require a judicial foreclosure process, and to foreclosuresand foreclosure sales in the majority of remainingstates where a judicial process is not required,but where an affidavit signed by Firm personnel may have been used as part of the foreclosureprocess. In mid-October, the Firm also temporarily suspended evictions in the states andterritories in which the Firm had suspended foreclosures and foreclosure sales, as well as incertain additional states in which an affidavit signed by Firm personnel may have been used inconnection with eviction proceedings.This temporary suspension arose out of questions about affidavits of indebtedness prepared by localforeclosure counsel, signed by Firm employees, and filed or used in mortgage foreclosureproceedings in certain states. Based on the Firms work to date, the Firm believes that theinformation in those affidavits of indebtedness about the fact of default and amount ofindebtedness was materially accurate. However, the underlying review and verification of thisinformation was performed by personnel other than the affiants, or the affidavits may not have beenproperly notarized. The Firm has since resumed filing new foreclosure actions in most of the statesin which the Firm had previously halted such actions, using revised procedures in connection withthe execution of the affidavits and other documents that may be used in the foreclosure process,and the Firm intends to resume filing new foreclosure actions in all remaining states. The Firm isalso in the process of reviewing pending foreclosure matters to determine whether the remediationof previously filed affidavits or other documents is necessary, and the Firm intends to resume pending foreclosure proceedings as the review, and if necessary, remediation, ofeach pending matter is completed.The Firm expects to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with its efforts to correctand enhance its mortgage foreclosure procedures. Multiple state and federal officials have announcedinvestigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks, includingJPMorgan Chase and its affiliates,relating to foreclosureand loss mitigation processes.The Firm iscooperating with these investigations,and these investigations could result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies(including requiring default servicing or other process changes), or other enforcement actions, as well as significantlegal costs in responding to governmental investigations and additional litigation.The Firm cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters or the impact that they could have on the Firms financial results.JPMorgan Chases commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potential catastrophicevents and environmental risks and regulation that may expose the Firm to significant cost andliability.JPMorgan Chase engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities,including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power,emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. The Firm is also engaged inpower generation and has invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developingand trading emission reduction credits. As a result of all of these activities, the Firm is subjectto extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws andregulations. The Firm expects laws and regulations affecting its commodities activities to expandin scope and complexity, and to restrict some of the Firms activities, which could result in lowerrevenues from the Firms commodities9Table of ContentsPart Iactivities. In addition, the Firm may incur substantial costsin complying with current or future laws and regulations, and the failure to comply with these lawsand regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. Furthermore,liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulationsfor remediation of contaminations.The Firms commodities activities also further expose the Firm to the risk of unforeseen andcatastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxicsubstances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result inpersonal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to the Firms reputation and suspension ofoperations. The Firms commodities activities are also subject to disruptions, many of which areoutside of the Firms control, from the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment,transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure of performance bythird-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver rawmaterials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. The Firms actions tomitigate its risks related to the above-mentioned considerations may not prove adequate to addressevery contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, andthe proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respectto particular incidents. As a result, the Firms financial condition and results of operations maybe adversely affected by such events.Damage to JPMorgan Chases reputation could damage its businesses.Maintaining trust in JPMorgan Chase is critical to the Firms ability to attract and maintaincustomers, investors and employees. Damage to the Firms reputation can therefore cause significantharm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numeroussources, including, among others, employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation orregulatory outcomes or governmental investigations. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriatestandards of service and quality, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clientsfairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, allof which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to reputation for the Firm.Adverse publicity regarding the Firm, whether or not true, may result in harm to the Firmsprospects. Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of orindividuals in the industry can also affect the Firms reputation. For example, the role played byfinancial services firms in the financial crisis, including concerns that consumers have beentreated unfairly by financial institutions, has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole.Should any of these or other events or factors that can undermine the Firms reputation occur,there is no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that the Firm may need to incur toaddress the issues giving rise to the reputational harm could not adversely affect the Firmsearnings and results of operations.Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as the Firmcontinues to expand its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations andinterests with and among the Firms clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceivedfailure to adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients todeal with the Firm, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions, as well as cause seriousreputational harm to the Firm.JPMorgan Chase relies on its systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failurescould materially adversely affect the Firms operations.JPMorgan Chases businesses are dependent on the Firms ability to process, record and monitor alarge number of complex transactions. If the Firms financial, accounting, or other data processingsystems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adverselyaffected. The Firm is similarly dependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adverselyaffected if one of its employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either asa result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulatesthe Firms operations or systems. Third parties with which the Firm does business could also besources of operational risk to the Firm, including relating to breakdowns or failures of suchparties own systems or employees. Any of these occurrences could diminish the Firms ability tooperate one or more of its businesses, or result in potential liability to clients, increasedoperating expenses, higher litigation costs (including fines and sanctions), reputational damage, regulatory intervention or weaker competitive standing, any of which could materiallyadversely affect the Firm.If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the Firmspossession were to be mishandled or misused, the Firm could suffer significant regulatoryconsequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could includecircumstances where, for example, such information was erroneously provided to parties who are notpermitted to have the information, either by fault of the Firms systems, employees, orcounterparties, or where such information was intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken bythird parties.The Firm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are whollyor partially beyond the Firms control, which may include, for example, computer viruses,electrical or telecommunications outages, failures of computer servers or other damage to theFirms property or assets; natural disasters; health emergencies or pandemics; or events arisingfrom local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may giverise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the Firm.In a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal control overfinancial reporting may occur from time to time, and there is no assurance that significantdeficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future. As processesare changed, or new products and services are introduced, the Firm may not fully appreciate oridentify new operational risks that may arise from such changes. In addition, there is the riskthat the Firms controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systemscould prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could adversely affect the Firms business andresults of operations by10Table of Contentsrequiring the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect,as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not coveredby insurance.JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedingsand from private actions brought against the Firm.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved in various legal proceedings,including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well asinvestigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies. Actions brought against the Firm mayresult in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, whichcould materially adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results ofoperations, or cause serious reputational harm to the Firm. As a participant in the financialservices industry, it is likely that the Firm will continue to experience a high level oflitigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to its businesses and operations.The financial services industry is highly competitive, and JPMorgan Chases inability to competesuccessfully may adversely affect its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and the Firm expects competitiveconditions to continue to intensify as continued consolidation in the financial services industryproduces larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable ofoffering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices.Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks,hedge funds, commodity trading companies, private equity firms, insurance companies, mutual fundcompanies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securitiesprocessing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and otherInternet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies.Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depositoryinstitutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and forfinancial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financialsolutions, including electronic securities trading. The Firms businesses generally compete on thebasis of the quality and variety of the Firms products and services, transaction execution,innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areasmay put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm tolose market share. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capitalinvestments in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increaseexpense or may require the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order toexecute larger, more competitive transactions. The Firm cannot provide assurance that thesignificant competition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect itsfuture results of operations.JPMorgan Chases acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all ofthe benefits anticipated.JPMorgan Chase has in the past and may in the future seek to expand its business by acquiring otherbusinesses. There can be no assurance that the Firms acquisitions will have the anticipatedpositive results, including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time requiredto complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of thecombined entity; or an improved price for JPMorgan Chase & Co.s common stock. Integration effortscould divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Firms operationsor results. The Firm cannot provide assurance that any integration efforts in connection withacquisitions already consummated or any new acquisitions would not result in the occurrence ofunanticipated costs or losses.Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause the Firm to lose customers or causecustomers to move their business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that theintegration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of the Firms ongoingbusinesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that could adverselyaffect the Firms ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and other business partners. The loss of key employees in connectionwith an acquisition could adversely affect the Firms ability to successfully conduct its business.JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success ofits business, and failure to do so may materially adversely affect the Firms performance.JPMorgan Chases employees are the Firms most important resource, and in many areas of thefinancial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on theFirm or its employees of certain existing and proposed restrictions or taxes on executivecompensation may adversely affect the Firms ability to attract and retain qualified seniormanagement and employees. If the Firm is unable to continue to retain and attract qualifiedemployees, the Firms performance, including its competitive position, could be materiallyadversely affected.JPMorgan Chases financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, ifincorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, JPMorgan Chase isrequired to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, includingin determining credit loss reserves, mortgage repurchase liability and reserves related tolitigations, among other items. Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including tradingassets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equityinvestments, structured notes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items,require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements.Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair value determinations based oninternally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on managementjudgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable pricelevels, making their valuation particularly subjective, as they are based on significant estimationand judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain loans11Table of ContentsPart Iandsecurities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheet items, which may lead to thepossibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment. If assumptions orestimates underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experiencematerial losses"
12,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2010-02-24,"ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORSThe following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that couldmaterially affect our financial condition and operations. Other factors that could affect ourfinancial condition and operations are discussed in the Forward-looking statements section onpage 135. However, factors besides those discussed below, in MD&A or elsewhere in this or otherreports that we filed or furnished with the SEC, also could adversely affect us. You should notconsider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that couldaffect us.Our results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. andinternational financial market and economic conditions.Our businesses have been, and in the future will continue to be, materially affected by economicand market conditions, including factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets; thelevel and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices;investor sentiment; corporate or other scandals that reduce confidence in the financial markets;inflation; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters,acts of war or terrorism; and the degree to which U.S. or international economies are expanding orexperiencing recessionary pressures. These factors can affect, among other things, the activitylevels of clients with respect to the size, number and timing of transactions involving ourinvestment and commercial banking businesses, including our underwriting and advisory businesses;the realization of cash returns from our private equity and principal investments businesses; thevolume of transactions that we execute for our customers and, therefore, the revenue we receivefrom commissions and spreads; the number and size of underwritings we manage on behalf of clients;and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications orunderwritings managed by us.We generally maintain large trading portfolios in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equitymarkets and we may have from time to time significant positions, including positions in securitiesin markets that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived from mark-to-marketvalues of our businesses are affected by many factors, including our credit standing; our successin effectively hedging our market and other risks; volatility in interest rates and equity, debtand commodities markets; credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets; andother economic and business factors. We anticipate that revenue relating to our trading andprincipal investment businesses will continue to experience volatility and there can be noassurance that such volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions that may affectpricing or our ability to realize returns from such investments could not materially adverselyaffect our earnings.4Table of ContentsThe fees we earn for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economicconditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in tradingmarkets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets we manage or hold in custody, which,in turn, could affect our revenue. Moreover, even in the absence of a market downturn, below-marketor sub-par performance by our investment management businesses could result in outflows of assetsunder management and supervision and, therefore, reduce the fees that we receive.During 2008, U.S. and global financial markets were extremely volatile and were materially andadversely affected by a significant lack of liquidity, loss of confidence in the financial sector,disruptions in the credit markets, reduced business activity, rising unemployment, declining homeprices, and erosion of consumer confidence. These factors contributed to adversely affecting ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations in 2008 and into early 2009. While thebusiness environment stabilized during the latter half of 2009, the current economic environmentremains weak, which affects our businesses profitability.Our consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions. Such conditionsinclude U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumerconfidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies, among others.The deterioration of these conditions can diminish demand for the consumer businesses products andservices, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economicconditions, such as declines in home prices, could lead to an increase in mortgage and other loandelinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can adversely affect our earnings.During 2008 and continuing in 2009, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increasedresolution costs of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and depleted the deposit insurancefund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the depositinsurance fund, the FDIC has increased assessment rates of insured institutions and adopted a rulein November 2009 requiring banks to prepay three years worth of premiums to replenish the depletedinsurance fund. If there are additional bank or financial institutions failures, we may be requiredto pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Any future increases of FDICinsurance premiums may adversely impact our earnings.In connection with the sale and securitization of loans (whether with or without recourse), theoriginator is generally required to make a variety of customaryrepresentations and warrantiesregarding both the originator and the loans being sold or securitized. We and certain of oursubsidiaries, as well as entities acquired by us as part of the Bear Stearns merger, and theWashington Mutual and other transactions, have made such representations and warranties inconnection with the sale and securitization of loans, and we will continue to do so in the ordinarycourse of our lending business.If a loan  does not comply with such representations or warrantiesis sold or securitized, we may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated lossdirectly, or we may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such losses. In 2009, thecosts of repurchasing mortgage loans that had been sold to government agencies such as Freddie Macand Fannie Mae  increased substantially, and could continue toincrease substantially further. Accordingly,  repurchase and/or indemnity obligations to government-sponsored enterprises or to private third-party purchasers couldmaterially and adversely affect our results of operations and earnings in the future.We cannot provide assurance that any of the above-mentioned conditions, or further continueddeterioration in economic, market or business conditions, will not have a material negative effecton the Firm in the future.If we do not effectively manage our liquidity, our business could be negatively affected.Our liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses, grow and be profitable. Somepotential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatilemarkets, diminished access to capital markets, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including,among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or otherentities), difficulty or inability to sell assets, unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral, andlack of market or customer confidence in us or our prospects. These conditions may be caused byevents over which we have little or no control. For example, the liquidity crisis experienced in2008 and into early 2009 increased our cost of funding and limited our access to some of ourtraditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, loans,credit card receivables and other assets. These or other conditions detrimental to our liquiditymay occur in the future.The credit ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. areimportant in order to maintain our liquidity. A reduction in their credit ratings could have anadverse effect on our access to liquidity sources, increase our cost of funds, trigger additionalcollateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willingto lend to us, thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing our profitability. Reductionin the ratings of certain SPEs or other entities to which we have a funding or other commitmentcould also negatively affect our liquidity where such ratings changes lead, directly or indirectly,to us being required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding. Critical factors inmaintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capitalratios, strong credit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, anddisciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.Our cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (theamount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities (or other benchmark securities)of the same maturity that we need to pay to our debt investors). Increases in our credit spreadscan significantly increase the cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous andmarket-driven, and influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. As such, our creditspreads may be unpredictable and highly volatile.5Table of ContentsPart IAs a holding company, we rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries for our cash flow and consequentability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take theform of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of our principal subsidiaries are subject tocapital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability toprovide such payments. Limitations in the payments we receive from our subsidiaries couldnegatively affect our liquidity position.The financial condition of our customers, clients and counterparties, including other financialinstitutions, could adversely affect us.A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments,derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. As one of the nations largestlenders, we have exposures to many different products and counterparties, and the credit quality ofour exposures can have a significant impact on our earnings. We estimate and establish reserves forcredit risks and potential credit losses inherent in our credit exposure (including unfundedlending commitments). This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition,requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how economicconditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. As is the case with anysuch assessments, there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors orthat we will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that we identify. Any such failurecould result in increases in delinquencies and default rates.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, orother relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financialservices industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual andhedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit riskin the event of default by the counterparty or client, which can be exacerbated during periods ofmarket illiquidity, such as experienced in 2008 and early 2009. During such periods, our creditrisk also may be further increased when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or isliquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivativeexposure due us. In addition, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateralsignificantly increases in times of market stress and illiquidity. We cannot provide assurance thatany such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.An example of the risks associated with our relationships with other financial institutions isthe collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI). On September 15, 2008, LBHI filed avoluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (theBankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, andthereafter several of its subsidiaries also filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11of the Bankruptcy Code (LBHI and such subsidiaries collectively, Lehman). On September 19, 2008,a liquidation case under the Securities Investor Protection Act(SIPA) was commenced in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York for Lehman Brothers Inc. (LBI), LBHIs U.S.broker-dealer subsidiary, and that court now presides over the LBISIPA liquidation case. We were LBIs clearing bank and,among other actions, made collateral calls totaling approximately $8billion in September 2008 and liquidated approximately $18 billion of securities subsequent toLehmans bankruptcy filing. We are the largest secured creditor in the Lehman and LBI cases,according to Lehmans schedules. It is possible that claims may be asserted against us and/or oursecurity interests, including by the LBHI Creditors Committee, the SIPA Trustee appointed in theLBI liquidation case, the principal acquirer of LBIs assets, and others in connection with Lehmanand LBI cases. We intend to defend ourself against any such claims. The LBHI examiner has filed areport with the Bankruptcy Court regarding his investigation into thecollapse of Lehman. Thereport remains under seal.If the current weak economic environment continues for an extended period of time, or deterioratesfurther, there is a greater likelihood that more of our customers or counterparties could becomedelinquent on their loans or other obligations to us which, in turn, could result in a higher levelof charge-offs and provision for credit losses, or requirements that we purchase assets or provideother funding, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition. Moreover, a significantdeterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns about thecredit quality of other counterparties in the same industry, thereby exacerbating our credit riskexposure, and increasing the losses, including mark-to-market losses, we could incur in ourtrading and clearing businesses.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.We have exposure to increased levels of risk when a number of customers are engaged in similarbusiness activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economicfeatures that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected bychanges in economic conditions. We regularly monitor various segments of our portfolio exposures toassess potential concentration risks. Our efforts to diversify or hedge our credit portfolioagainst concentration risks may not be successful and any concentration of credit risk couldincrease the potential for significant losses in our credit portfolio. In addition, disruptions inthe liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell,syndicate or realize upon securities, loans or other instruments or positions held by us, therebyleading to increased concentrations of such positions. These concentrations could expose us tolosses if the mark-to-market value of the securities, loans or other instruments or positionsdecline causing us to take write downs. Moreover, the inability to reduce our positions not onlyincreases the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increases the levelof risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet, thereby increasing our capital requirements andfunding costs, all of which could adversely affect our businesses operations and profitability.Our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processesand procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk towhich we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market6Table of Contentsrisk, interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, reputational risks andprivate equity risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there areinherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in thefuture, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk managementframework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adverselyaffected.Our risk management strategies may not be effective because in a difficult or less liquid marketenvironment other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies todeal with the difficult market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for us toreduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks thatcould cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated creditevents, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to becomecorrelated (and vice versa) may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken intoaccount in the development, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. In addition, certainof our derivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities,commodities or obligations that we do not own; if we are not able to obtain such securities,commodities or obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause us toforfeit payments otherwise due to us and could result in settlement delays, which could damage ourreputation and ability to transact future business. In addition, in situations where derivativestransactions are not settled or confirmed on a timely basis, we may be subject to heightened creditand operational risk, and in the event of a default, we may find the contract more difficult toenforce. Further, as new and more complex derivative products are created, disputes regarding theterms or the settlement procedures of the contracts could arise, which could force us to incurunexpected costs, including transaction and legal costs, and impair our ability to manageeffectively our risk exposure from these products.Many of our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historic marketbehavior, and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managementssubjective judgment. For example, many models used by us are based on assumptions regardingcorrelations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of marketstress, such as occurred during 2008, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previouslyuncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators maymake unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market oreconomic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of our risk managementstrategies, causing us to incur losses. In addition, as our businesses change and grow and themarkets in which they operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keepsufficient pace with those changes. For example, there is the risk that the credit and market risksassociated with new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified,monitored or managed. We cannot provideassurance that our risk management framework, including ourunderlying assumptions or strategies, will at all times be accurate and effective.Our operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary, political, legaland other developments in the United States and around the world.Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted byvarious regulatory authorities of the United States, non-U.S. governments and internationalagencies.The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit inthe United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investingand the return earned on those loans and investments. The market impact from such policies can alsomaterially decrease the value of financial assets that we hold, such as debt securities andmortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentiallyincreasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us.Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies are beyond our control and, consequently, the impact ofthese changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.Our businesses and revenue are also subject to the risks inherent in maintaining internationaloperations and in investing and trading in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include,among others, risk of loss from the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism and variousunfavorable political, economic, legal or other developments, including social or politicalinstability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation,nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, andchanges in laws and regulations. Further, various countries in which we operate or invest, or inwhich we may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptionsparticular to that country or region, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, orlow or negative growth, among other negative conditions. Crime, corruption, war or militaryactions, acts of terrorism and a lack of an established legal and regulatory framework areadditional challenges in some of these countries, particularly in certain emerging markets. Revenuefrom international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities may be subject to negativefluctuations as a result of the above considerations. The impact of these fluctuations could beaccentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets.Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past,affected our operations and investments in another country or countries, including our operationsin the U.S. Any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have an adverse impact on ourbusiness and results of operations.Our power generation and commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potentialcatastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose us to significant costand liability.We engage in power generation, and in connection with the commodities activities of our InvestmentBank, we engage in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several7Table of ContentsPart Icommodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas,electric power, emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. We have also invested in companies engaged in wind energy and in sourcing, developing and trading emission reduction credits. As a result ofthese activities, we are subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, andother governmental laws and regulations. We expect laws and regulations affecting our powergeneration and commodities activities to expand in scope and complexity. We may incur substantialcosts in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with theselaws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. In addition,liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulationsfor remediation of contaminations. Our power generation and commodities activities also furtherexposes us to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks,spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, andterrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage toour reputation and suspension of operations. In addition, our power generation activities aresubject to disruptions, many of which are outside of our control, from the breakdown or failure ofpower generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractualfailure of performance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure toobtain and deliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. Ouractions to mitigate our risks related to the abovementioned considerations may not prove adequateto address every contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not beavailable, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to coverliabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, our financial condition and resultsof operations may be adversely affected by such events.We rely on our systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materiallyadversely affect our operations.Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number ofincreasingly complex transactions. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data processingsystems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. Weare similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one of ouremployees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human erroror where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations orsystems. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us,including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems or employees. Any ofthese occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or result inpotential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which couldmaterially adversely affect us.If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession wereto be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputationaldamage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include circumstances where, forexample, such information was erroneously provided toparties who are not permitted to have theinformation, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or such information wasintercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly orpartially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, electrical ortelecommunications outages, or other damage to our property or assets; natural disasters; healthemergencies or pandemics; or events arising from local or larger scale political events, includingterrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss orliability to us.In a firm as large and complex as ours, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financialreporting may occur from time to time, and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies ormaterial weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future. In addition, there is therisk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systemscould prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could adversely affect our operations and results ofoperations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as byexposing us to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses not covered by insurance.We operate within a highly regulated industry and our business and results are significantlyaffected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject.We are subject to regulation under state and federal laws in the U.S., as well as the applicablelaws of each of the various other jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which we do business. Theselaws and regulations affect the type and manner in which we do business and may limit our abilityto expand our product offerings, pursue acquisitions, or restrict the scope of operations andservices provided.Recent market and economic conditions have led to new legislation and numerous proposals forchanges in the regulation of the financial services industry, including significant additionallegislation and regulation in the United States. For example, new legislation and regulationaffecting the credit card industry is expected to adversely affect our Card Services business byreducing revenue and increasing compliance costs.Recent proposals for further regulation of financial institutions, both domestically andinternationally, include calls to increase their capital and liquidity requirements; limit the sizeand types of the activities permitted; and increase taxes on some institutions. For example, theWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 recently passed by the U.S. House ofRepresentatives would, among other things, establish a Consumer Financial Protection Agency havingbroad authority to regulate providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financialproducts and services, as well as create a structure to regulate systemically important financialcompanies, and provide regulators with the power to require such companies to sell or transferassets and terminate activities if the regulators determine that the size or scope of activities ofthe company pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the company or the financial stability ofthe United States. Also proposed is more comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counterderivatives market, including providing for8Table of Contentsmore strict capital and margin requirements, the central clearing of standardized over-the-counterderivatives, and heightened supervision of all over-the-counter derivatives dealers and majormarket participants, including the Firm.These new (and other) legislative and regulatory changes could result in significant loss ofrevenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engagingin, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain of our businesspractices, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect our businesses.Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that any such new legislation or regulation would not havean adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.If we do not comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to ouroperations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or material restrictions on our businesses in thejurisdiction where the violation occurred. In recent years, regulatory oversight and enforcementhave increased substantially, imposing additional costs and increasing the potential risksassociated with our operations. As this regulatory trend continues, it could adversely affect ouroperations and, in turn, our financial results.We face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and fromprivate actions brought against us.We are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including classactions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well as investigations orproceedings brought by regulatory agencies. Actions brought against us may result in judgments,settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adverselyaffect our business, financial condition or results of operation, or cause us serious reputationalharm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely we will continue toexperience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to ourbusinesses and operations.There is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect ourresults of operations.We operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competitive conditions to continue tointensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger,better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a widerarray of financial products and services at more competitive prices.We also face an increasing array of competitors. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms,investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, private equity firms, insurancecompanies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trustcompanies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies,e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services andadvisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible fornon-depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were bankingproducts, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronicandInternet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. Our businessesgenerally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of our products and services, transactionexecution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all ofthese areas may put downward pressure on prices for our products and services or may cause us tolose market share. Increased competition also may require us to make additional capital investmentin our businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or mayrequire us to extend more of our capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, morecompetitive transactions. We cannot provide assurance that the significant and increasingcompetition in the financial services industry will not materially adversely affect our futureresults of operations.Our acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefitsanticipated.We have in the past and may in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses.There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results,including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete theintegration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of the combinedentity; or an improved price for our common stock. Integration of an acquired business can becomplex and costly, sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systemsand management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients,suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention andresources, which could adversely affect our operations or results. We cannot provide assurance thatany integration efforts of acquisitions already consummated or any new acquisitions would notresult in the occurrence of unanticipated costs or losses.We may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take additional markdowns andallowances for loan losses on the assets and loans acquired in the merger (the Bear Stearnsmerger) by JPMorgan Chase and The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. (Bear Stearns) and in connectionwith the acquisition of Washington Mutual Banks (Washington Mutual) banking operations (theWashington Mutual transaction). We cannot assure you that as our integration efforts continue inconnection with these transactions, other unanticipated costs or losses will not be incurred.Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or causecustomers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financialinstitutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result inthe disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures andpolicies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers,depositors and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition couldadversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business.Damage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers,investors and employees. Damage to our9Table of ContentsPart Ireputation can therefore cause significant harm to our business and prospects. Harm to ourreputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others, employee misconduct,litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality,compliance failures, unethical behavior, and the activities of customers and counterparties.Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, may result in harm to our prospects.Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members of or individuals in theindustry can also affect our reputation. For example, the role played by financial services firmsin the financial crisis has damaged the reputation of the industry as a whole.We could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potentialconflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasinglycomplex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations andinterests with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failureto adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal withus, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. Therefore, there can be no assurance thatconflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our businessand failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.Our employees are our most important resource and, in many areas of the financial servicesindustry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The imposition on us or on our employeesof certain of the currently proposed restrictions or taxes on executive compensation may adverselyaffect our ability to attract and retain qualified senior management and employees. If we areunable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, our performance, including ourcompetitive position, could be materially adversely affected.Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if wrong, couldcause unexpected losses in the future.Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we arerequired to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, includingin determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigations and the fair value of certainassets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financialstatements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.Certain of our financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-salesecurities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certainrepurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value inorder to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we maymake fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimatelyrely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may haveno direct observable price levels, making their valuationparticularly subjective, being based onsignificant estimationand judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines inprices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheetitems, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change oradjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings"
8,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2009-03-02,"ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORSThe following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materiallyaffect our financial condition and operations. Other factors that could affect our financialcondition and operations are discussed in the Forward-looking statements section on page 115.However, factors besides those discussed below, in MD&A orelsewhere in this or other reports that we filed or furnished with the SEC, also could adverselyaffect us. You should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of allpotential risks that could affect us.4Table of ContentsOurresults of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by U.S. andinternational financial market and economic conditions.Our businesses have been, and in the future will continue to be, materially affected by economicand market conditions, including factors such as the liquidity of the global financial markets; thelevel and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and currency and commodities prices;investor sentiment; corporate or other scandals that reduce confidence in the financial markets;inflation; the availability and cost of capital and credit; the occurrence of natural disasters,acts of war or terrorism; and the degree to which U.S. or international economies are expanding orexperiencing recessionary pressures. These factors can affect, among other things, the activitylevel of clients with respect to the size, number and timing of transactions involving ourinvestment and commercial banking businesses, including our underwriting and advisory businesses;the realization of cash returns from our private equity and principal investments businesses; thevolume of transactions that we execute for our customers and, therefore, the revenue we receivefrom commissions and spreads; the number or size of underwritings we manage on behalf of clients;and the willingness of financial sponsors or other investors to participate in loan syndications orunderwritings managed by us.We generally maintain large trading portfolios in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equitymarkets and we may have from time to time significant investment positions, including positions insecurities in markets that lack pricing transparency or liquidity. The revenue derived frommark-to-market values of our businesses are affected by many factors, including our creditstanding; our success in proprietary positioning; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt andcommodities markets; credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets; and othereconomic and business factors. We anticipate that revenue relating to our trading and principalinvestment businesses will continue to experience volatility and there can be no assurance thatsuch volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions that may affect pricing or ourability to realize returns from such investments could not materially adversely affect ourearnings.The fees we earn for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economicconditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in tradingmarkets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets we manage or hold in custody, which,in turn, could affect our revenue. Moreover, even in the absence of a market downturn, below-marketor sub-par performance by our investment management businesses could result in outflows of assetsunder management and supervision and, therefore, reduce the fees that we receive.Our consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions. Such conditionsinclude U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumerconfidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies, among others.The deterioration of these conditions can diminish demand for the consumer businesses products andservices, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. In addition, adverse economicconditions, such as declines in home prices, could lead to an increase in mortgage and other loandelinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can adversely affect our earnings.During 2008, U.S. and global financial markets were extremely volatile and were materially andadversely affected by a significant lack of liquidity, loss of confidence in the financialsector,disruptions in the credit markets, reduced business activity, rising unemployment, declining homeprices, and erosion of consumer confidence. These factors contributed to adversely affecting ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations in 2008 and there is no assurance when suchconditions will ameliorate.If we do not effectively manage our liquidity, our business could be negatively affected.Our liquidity is critical to our ability to operate our businesses, grow and be profitable. Somepotential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include illiquid or volatilemarkets, diminished access to capital markets, unforeseen cash or capital requirements (including,among others, commitments that may be triggered to special purpose entities (SPEs) or otherentities), difficulty or inability to sell assets, unforeseenoutflows of cash or collateral, and lack of market or customerconfidence in us or our prospects.These conditions may be caused by events over which we have little or no control. The liquiditycrisis experienced in 2008 increased our cost of funding and limited our access to some of ourtraditional sources of liquidity such as securitized debt offerings backed by mortgages, loans,credit card receivables and other assets. If current market conditions continue, our liquiditycould be adversely affected.The credit ratings of JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Chase Bank USA, N.A. areimportant in order to maintain our liquidity. A reduction in their credit ratings could have anadverse effect on our access toliquidity sources, increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or fundingrequirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us,thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing our profitability. Reduction in the ratingsof certain SPEs or other entities to which we have a funding or other commitment could alsonegatively affect our liquidity where such ratings changes lead, directly or indirectly, to usbeing required to purchase assets or otherwise provide funding. Critical factors in maintaininghigh credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream, strong capital ratios, strongcredit quality and risk management controls, diverse funding sources, and disciplined liquiditymonitoring procedures.Our cost of obtaining long-term unsecured funding is directly related to our credit spreads (theamount in excess of the interest rate of U.S. Treasury securities (or other benchmark securities)of the same maturity that we need to pay to our debt investors). Increases in our credit spreadscan significantly increase the cost of this funding. Changes in credit spreads are continuous andmarket-driven, and influenced by market perceptions of our creditworthiness. As such, our creditspreads may be unpredictable and highly volatile.As a holding company, we rely on the earnings of our subsidiaries for our cash flow and consequentability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take theform of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of our principal subsidiaries are subject tocapital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractual restrictions on their ability toprovide such payments. Limitations in the payments we receive from our subsidiaries couldnegatively affect our liquidity position.The soundness of our customers, clients and counterparties, including other financial institutions,could adversely affect us.A number of our products expose us to credit risk, including loans, leases and lending commitments,derivatives, trading account assets and assets held-for-sale. As one of the nations largestlenders, we have exposures to many different5Table of ContentsPart Iproductsand counterparties, and the credit quality ofour exposures can have a significant impact on our earnings. We estimate and establish reserves forcredit risks and potential credit losses inherent in our credit exposure (including unfundedlending commitments). This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition,requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including forecasts of how these economicconditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. As is the case with anysuch assessments, there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors orthat we will fail to accurately estimate the impact of factors that we identify. Any such failurecould result in increases in delinquencies and default rates.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, orother relationships. We routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financialservices industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual andhedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit riskin the event of default by the counterparty or client, which can be exacerbated during periods ofmarket illiquidity, such as experienced in 2008. During such periods, our credit risk also may befurther increased when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at pricesthat are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. Inaddition, disputes with counterparties as to the valuation of collateral significantly increases intimes of market stress and illiquidity. There is no assurance that any such losses would notmaterially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.As an example of the risks associated with our relationships with other financial institutions isthe collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LBHI). On September 15, 2008, LBHI filed avoluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (theBankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, andthereafter several of its subsidiaries also filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11of the Bankruptcy Code in the court (LBHI and such subsidiaries collectively, Lehman). OnSeptember 19, 2008, a liquidation case under the Securities Investor Protection Act was commencedin the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for Lehman Brothers Inc.(LBI), LBHIs U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary, and the court now presides over the LBI SIPAliquidation case. We were LBIs clearing bank and are the largest secured creditor in the Lehmanand LBI cases, according to Lehmans schedules. We anticipate that claims may be asserted against usand/or our security interests, including by the LBHI Creditors Committee, the SIPA Trusteeappointed in the LBI liquidation case, the principal acquiror of LBIs assets, and others inconnection with Lehman and LBI cases. We intend to defend ourself against any such claims.As a result of the current economic environment there is a greater likelihood that more of ourcustomers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to uswhich, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, orrequirements that we purchase assets or provide other funding, any of which could adversely affectour financial condition. Moreover, a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of ourcounterparties could lead to concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the sameindustry, thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure, and increasing the losses, includingmark-to-market losses, we could incur in our trading, clearing, and proprietary businesses.Concentration of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.We have exposure to increased levels of risk when a number of customers are engaged in similarbusiness activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economicfeatures that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected bychanges in economic conditions. We regularly monitor various segments of our portfolio exposures toassess potential concentration risks. Our efforts to diversify or hedge our credit portfolioagainst concentration risks may not be successful and any concentration of credit risk couldincrease the potential for significant losses in our credit portfolio. In addition, disruptions inthe liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell,syndicate or realize upon securities, loans or other instruments or positions held by us,thereby leading to increased concentrationsof such positions. These concentrations could expose us tolosses if the mark-to-market value of the securities, loans or other instruments or positionsdecline causing us to take write downs. Moreover, the inability to reduce our positions not onlyincreases the market and credit risks associated with such positions, but also increases the levelof risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet, thereby increasing our capital requirements andfunding costs, all of which could adversely affect ourbusinesses operations and profitability.Our framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.Our risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established processesand procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk towhich we are subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk,operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, reputational risk and private equity risk, amongothers. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our riskmanagement strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have notappropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, wecould suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.Our risk management strategies may not be effective because in a difficult or less liquid marketenvironment other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies todeal with the difficult market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for us toreduce our risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.Our derivatives businesses may expose us to unexpected market, credit and operational risks thatcould cause us to suffer unexpected losses. Severe declines in asset values, unanticipated creditevents, or unforeseen circumstances that may cause previously uncorrelated factors to becomecorrelated may create losses resulting from risks not appropriately taken into account in thedevelopment, structuring or pricing of a derivative instrument. In addition, certain of ourderivative transactions require the physical settlement by delivery of securities, commodities orobligations that we do now own; if we are not able to obtain such securities, commodities orobligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could cause us to forfeit paymentsotherwise due to us and could result in settlement delays, which could damage our reputation andability to transact future business. In addition, many derivative transactions are not cleared andsettled through a central clearinghouse or exchange, and they may not always be confirmed orsettled by counterparties on a timely basis. In these situations, we are subject to heightenedcredit and operational risk, and in the event of a default, we may find the contract more difficultto enforce. Further, as new and more complex derivative products are created, disputes regardingthe terms or the settlement procedures of the contracts could arise, which could force us to incurunexpected costs, including transaction and legal costs, and impair our ability to manageeffectively our risk exposure from these products.Many of our hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historic marketbehavior, and all6Table of Contentssuch strategies and techniques are based to some degree on managementssubjective judgment. For example, many models used by us are based on assumptions regardingcorrelations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times of marketstress, such as occurred during 2008, or in the event of other unforeseen circumstances, previouslyuncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators maymake unrelated movements. These sudden market movements or unanticipated or unidentified market oreconomic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of our risk managementstrategies, causing us to incur losses. In addition, as our businesses grow and the markets inwhich they operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficientpace with those changes. For example, there is the risk that the credit and market risks associatedwith new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified, monitored ormanaged. There can be no assurance that our risk management framework, including our underlyingassumptions or strategies, will at all times be accurate and effective.Our operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, monetary, political, legaland other developments in the United States and around the world.Our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted byvarious regulatory authorities of the United States, non-U.S. governments and internationalagencies.The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regulates the supply of money and credit inthe United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investingand the return earned on those loans and investments. The market impact from such policies can alsomaterially decrease the value of financial assets that we hold, such as debt securities andmortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Its policies also can adversely affect borrowers, potentiallyincreasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us.Changes in Federal Reserve policies are beyond our control and, consequently, the impact of thesechanges on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.Our businesses and revenue are also subject to the risks inherent in maintaining internationaloperations and in investing and trading in securities of companies worldwide. These risks include,among others, risk of loss from the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism and variousunfavorable political, economic, legal or other developments, including social or politicalinstability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation,nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls, exchange controls, andchanges in laws and regulations. Further, various countries in which we operate or invest, or inwhich we may do so in the future, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions,including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among othernegative conditions. Crime, corruption, war or military actions, acts of terrorism and alack of an established legal and regulatory framework are additional challenges in some of thesecountries, particularly in the emerging markets. Revenue from international operations and tradingin non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a resultof the aboveconsiderations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets aresmaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned eventsor circumstances in one country can and has in the past, affected our operations and investmentsin another country or countries. Any such unfavorable conditions or developments could have anadverse impact on our business and results of operations.The emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic also could create economic or financialdisruption that could negatively affect our revenue and operations or impair our ability to manageour businesses in certain parts of the world.Our power generation and commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potentialcatastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose it to significant costand liability.We engage in power generation, and in connection with the commodities activities of our InvestmentBank, we engage in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities,including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power,emission credits, coal, freight, and related products and indices. As a result of these activities,we are subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmentallaws and regulations. We expect laws and regulations affecting our power generation and commoditiesactivities to expand in scope and complexity. We may incur substantial costs in complying withcurrent or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulationsmay result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. In addition, liability may beincurred without regard to fault under certain environmental laws and regulations for remediationof contaminations. Our power generation and commodities activities also further exposes us to therisk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions,release of toxic substances, fires, accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks thatcould result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, damage to our reputation andsuspension of operations. In addition, our power generation activities are subject to disruptions,many of which are outside of our control, from the breakdown or failure of power generationequipment, transmission lines or other equipment or processes, and the contractual failure ofperformance by third-party suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain anddeliver raw materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities. We attempt tomitigate our risks, but our actions may not prove adequate to address every contingency. Inaddition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any,from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particularincidents. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affectedby such events.We rely on our systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could materiallyadversely affect our operations.Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number ofincreasingly complex transactions. If any of our financial, accounting, or other data7Table of ContentsPart Iprocessingsystems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. Weare similarly dependent on our employees. We could be materially adversely affected if one of ouremployees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human erroror where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations orsystems. Third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk to us,including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems or employees. Any ofthese occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our businesses, or result inpotential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which couldmaterially adversely affect us.If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in our possession wereto be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputationaldamage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if suchinformation were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information,either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information isintercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.We may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly orpartially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical ortelecommunications outages, natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property orphysical assets, or events arising from local or larger scale politics, including terrorist acts.Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to us.In a firm as large and complex as us, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financialreporting may occur from time to time, and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies ormaterial weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future. In addition, there is therisk that our controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systemsprove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect our operations and could materially adverselyaffect our results of operations by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct thedefect, as well as by exposing us to litigation, regulatory fines or penalties or losses notcovered by insurance.We operate within a highly regulated industry and our business and results aresignificantly affected by the laws and regulations to which we are subject.We operate within a highly regulated industry. We are subject to regulation under state and federallaws in the U.S., as well as the applicable laws of each of the various other jurisdictions outsidethe U.S. in which we do business. These laws and regulations affect the type and manner in which wedo business and may limit our ability to expand our product offerings, pursue acquisitions, orrestrict the scope of operations and services provided.Recent market and economic conditions have led to new legislation and numerous proposals forchanges in the regulation of the financial services industry, including significant additionallegislation and regulation in the United States. In response to such market and economicconditions, the United States government, particularly the U.S. Department of the Treasury, theBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, and foreign governments,have taken avariety of extraordinary measures designed to restore confidence in the financial markets, increaseliquidity and to strengthen financial institutions. For example, on October 3, 2008 and on February17, 2009, the EESA and the ARRA, respectively, were signed into law. These laws areintended to provide fiscal stimulus and stability to the U.S. economy, by among other things,permitting the U.S. Treasury to make direct investments in financial institutions pursuant to theCapital Purchase Program. There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that theselaws and their implementing regulations, or any other governmental program, will have on thefinancial markets. The failure of the financial markets to stabilize and a continuation orworsening of current financial market and economic conditions could continue to materially andadversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or thetrading price of our common stock.Participation in current or future government programs adopted in response to recent market eventsand economic conditions may subject us to restrictions and additional oversight on the manner inwhich we operate our business. We are currently participating in the Capital Purchase Program, andunder the terms of the program, as amended by the ARRA, the consent of the U.S. Treasury isrequired for us to, among other things, increase our common stockdividend from the amount of the last quarterly stock dividenddeclared by us prior to October 14, 2008 or, except in limitedcircumstances, repurchase our common stock or other preferred stock unless the Series K PreferredStock that was issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program has been redeemed orthe U.S. Treasury has transferred all of the Series K Preferred Stock to a third party. The ARRAalso imposes restrictions on our ability to pay incentive compensation to certain of our employees.There can be no assurance that any additional restrictions imposed by reason of our participationin the Capital Purchase Program or other government programs will nothave an adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.Newlegislation and regulatory changes could cause business disruptions, result in significant loss ofrevenue, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities we might otherwise consider engagingin, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain of our businesspractices, impose additional costs on us or otherwise adverselyaffect our business. For example, on December 18, 2008, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System adoptedenhanced regulations for credit cards through amendments to Regulation Z, which implements theTruth-in-Lending Act, and also new regulations governing unfair or deceptive acts or practicesunder the Federal Trade Commission Act. These regulatory changes will require us to investsignificant management attention and resources to make the necessary disclosure and system changes,and could adversely affect our business.Additional legislation and regulations may by enacted or promulgated in the future, and we areunable to predict the form such legislation or regulation may take, or the degree to which we wouldneed to modify our businesses or operations to comply with such legislation or regulation. Forexample, proposed legislation has been introduced in Congress that would amend to the BankruptcyCode to permit modifications of certain mortgages that are secured by a Chapter 13 debtorsprincipal residence. Proposed legislation has also been introduced in Congress that would, amongother things, prescribe when interest can be charged on revolving credit card accounts, prescribewhen and how interest rates can be increased, limit events of default that can result in interestrate increases on existing balances, restrict the imposition of certain fees, require a specifiedcutoff hour when payments must be credited to accounts, prescribe how payments must be allocated tooutstanding balances on accounts and restrict the issuance of credit cards for persons under 21years of age except in certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that if any suchlegislation were enacted that it would not have an adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations or financial condition.If we donot comply with the legislation and regulations that apply to ouroperations, we may be subject to fines, penalties ormaterial restrictions on our businesses in the jurisdiction where the violation occurred. In recentyears, regulatory oversight and enforcement have increased substantially, imposing additional costsand increasing the potential risks associated with our operations. If this regulatory trendcontinues, it could adversely affect our operations and, in turn, our financial results. Inaddition, adverse publicity and damage to our reputation arising from the failure or perceivedfailure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements could affect our ability toattract and retain customers or to maintain access to capital markets, which could adversely affectour financial condition.8Table of ContentsWe face significant legal risks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and fromprivate actions brought against us.We are named as a defendant or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including classactions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well as investigations orproceedings brought by regulatory agencies. Actions brought against us may result in judgments,settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adverselyaffect our business, financial condition or results of operation, or cause us serious reputationalharm. As a participant in the financial services industry, it is likely we will continue toexperience a high level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to ourbusinesses and operations.There is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect ourresults of operations.We operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competitive conditions to continue tointensify as continued merger activity in the financial services industry produces larger,better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a widerarray of financial products and services at more competitive prices. Consolidations in thefinancial services industry increased substantially during 2008, as several major U.S.financial institutions merged, were forced to sell assets and, in some cases failed.We also face an increasing array of competitors. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms,investment banking companies, merchant banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, mutual fundcompanies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, trust companies, securitiesprocessing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and otherInternet-based companies, and a variety of other financial services and advisory companies.Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depositoryinstitutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and forfinancial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financialsolutions, including electronic securities trading. Our businesses generally compete on the basisof the quality and variety of our products and services, transaction execution, innovation,reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may putdownward pressure on prices for our products and services or may cause us to lose market share.Increased competition also may require us to make additional capital investment in our businessesin order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may require us to extendmore of our capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions.There can be no assurance that the significant and increasing competition in the financial servicesindustry will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations.Our acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses may not result in all of the benefitsanticipated.We have in the past and may in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses.There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results,including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete theintegration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overall performance of the combinedentity; or an improved price for our common stock. Integration of an acquired business can becomplex and costly, sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systemsand management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients,suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention andresources, which could adversely affect our operations or results.Given the continued market volatility and uncertainty, we may continue to experience increasedcredit costs or need to take additional markdowns and allowances for loan losses on the assets andloans acquired in the merger (the Bear Stearns merger)by and among JPMorgan Chase and The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. (Bear Stearns) and in connection with the acquisition of Washington Mutual Banks (Washington Mutual) banking operations (the Washington Mutual transaction) that couldnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future. There is noassurance that as our integration efforts continue in connection with these transactions, otherunanticipated costs or losses will not be incurred.Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or causecustomers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financialinstitutions. It is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result inthe disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures andpolicies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers,depositors and employees. The loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition couldadversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business.Damage to our reputation could damage our businesses.Maintaining a positive reputation is critical to our attracting and maintaining customers,investors and employees. Damage to our reputation can therefore cause significant harm to ourbusiness and prospects. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, amongothers, employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimumstandards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior, and the activities ofcustomers and counterparties. Further, negative publicity regarding us, whether or not true, mayalso result in harm to our prospects.We could suffer significant reputational harm if we fail to properly identify and manage potentialconflicts of interest. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasinglycomplex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations andinterests with and among our clients. The failure to adequately address, or the perceived failureto adequately address, conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal withus, or give rise to litigation or enforcement actions. Therefore, there can be no assurance thatconflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us.9Table of ContentsPart IOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our businessand failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.Our employees are our most important resource and, in many areas of the financial servicesindustry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. The executive compensation restrictionscurrently, or that may in the future may be, imposed on us as a result of our participation in theCapital Purchase Program or other government programs, may adversely affect our ability to attractand retain qualified senior management and employees. If we are unable to continue to retain andattract qualified employees, our performance, including our competitive position, could bematerially adversely affected.Our financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if wrong, couldcause unexpected losses in the future.Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements,including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigations and the fair valueof certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying ourfinancial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses.For example, we make judgments in connection with our consolidation analysis of SPEs. If it islater determined that non-consolidated SPEs should be consolidated, this could negatively affectour Consolidated Balance Sheets, related funding requirements, capital ratios and, if the SPEsassets include unrealized losses, could require us to recognize those losses.Certain of our financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale securities, certain loans, MSRs, private equity investments, structured notes and certainrepurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value inorder to prepare our financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, we maymake fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimatelyrely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other assets and liabilities may haveno direct observable price levels, making their valuation particularly subjective, being based onsignificant estimation and judgment. In addition, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines inprices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain balance sheetitems, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change oradjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings"
10,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2008-02-29,">Item 1A: Risk factors  The following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors that could materially affect theFirms financial condition and operations. Other factors that could affect the Firms business and operations are discussed in the Forward-looking statements section on page 101. However, factors besides those discussed below,in the MD&A or elsewhere in this or other of the Firms reports filed or furnished with the SEC, also could adversely affect the Firm. The reader should not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of all potentialrisks that could affect the Firm.  JPMorgan Chases results of operations could be adversely affected by U.S. and international markets and economicconditions.  U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions have a significant impact on the Firms businesses. Factors such as the liquidity ofthe global financial markets; the level and volatility of debt and equity prices, interest rates and commodities prices; investor sentiment; inflation; the availability and cost of capital and credit; and the degree to which U.S. or internationaleconomies are expanding or experiencing recessionary pressures can affect significantly the activity level of clients with respect to size, number and timing of transactions involving the Firms investment and commercial banking businesses,including its underwriting and advisory businesses. These factors also can affect the realization of cash returns from the Firms private equity business. A market downturn can lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that the Firmexecutes for its customers and, therefore, lead to a decline in the revenue the Firm receives from trading commissions and spreads. Lower market volatility reduces trading and arbitrage opportunities, which could lead to lower trading revenue.Higher interest rates, widening credit spreads or less liquidity or other weakness in the markets also could adversely affect the number or size of underwritings the Firm manages on behalf of clients and affect the willingness of financial sponsorsor investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by JPMorgan Chase.  The Firm generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixedincome, currency, commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions, including merchant banking investments held by its private equity business. The revenue derived from mark-to-market values of the Firms businesses areaffected by many factors, including its credit standing; its success in proprietary positioning; volatility in interest rates and equity, debt and commodities markets; credit spreads and availability of liquidity in the capital markets, and othereconomic and business factors. JPMorgan Chase anticipates that revenue relating to its trading will continue to experience volatility and there can be no assurance that such volatility relating to the above factors or other conditions could notmaterially adversely affect the Firms earnings.  The fees JPMorgan Chase earns for managing third-party assets are also dependent upon general economicconditions. For example, a higher level of U.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect the valuations of the third-party assets managed by, or held in custody of, the Firm, which, in turn, could affect theFirms revenue. Moreover, even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market or sub-par performance by JPMorgan Chases investment management businesses could result in outflows  of assets under management and supervision and, therefore, reduce the feesthe Firm receives.  The credit quality of JPMorgan Chases on and offbalance sheet assets may also be affected by economic conditions. In a pooreconomic environment there is a greater likelihood that more of the Firms customers or counterparties could become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to JPMorgan Chase which, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offsand provision for credit losses, or requirements that the Firm purchase assets or provide other funding, any of which could adversely affect the Firms financial condition.  The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economic conditions. Such conditions include U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; housing prices; the level of consumer confidence; changes inconsumer spending; and the number of personal bankruptcies, among others. Certain changes to these conditions can diminish demand for the consumer businesses products and services, or increase the cost to provide such products and services. Inaddition, adverse economic conditions, such as declines in home prices, could lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies and higher net charge-offs, which can adversely affect the Firms earnings.  Sudden illiquidity in markets or other abrupt changes in markets or economic indicators can adversely affect any or all of the Firms businesses. For example, sudden declinesin liquidity or prices of certain loans and securities may make it more difficult to value certain Firm balance sheet items, which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead todeclines in the Firms earnings.  There is increasing competition in the financial services industry which may adversely affect JPMorgan Chases resultsof operations.  JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expects competitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued mergeractivity in the financial services industry produces larger, better-capitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices.  The Firm also faces an increasing array of competitors. Competitors include other banks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, insurance companies, mutualfund companies, credit card companies, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, trust companies, securities processing companies, automobile financing companies, leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and a variety ofother financial services and advisory companies. Technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products, and for financialinstitutions and other companies to provide electronic and Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading. JPMorgan Chases businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and variety of its products andservices, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of these areas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and services or may cause the Firm to lose marketshare. Increased competition also may require the Firm to make additional capital investment in its businesses in order to remain competitive. These investments may increase expense or may   4 Table of Contents requirethe Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order to execute larger, more competitive transactions. There can be no assurance that the significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry will not materiallyadversely affect JPMorgan Chases future results of operations.  JPMorgan Chases acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may not result inall of the benefits anticipated.  The Firm has in the past and may in the future seek to grow its business by acquiring other businesses. There can be noassurance that the Firms acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; the overallperformance of the combined entity; or improved price for the Firms common stock. Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and managementcontrols, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners.  There is no assurance that JPMorgan Chasesmost recent acquisitions or that any businesses acquired in the future will be successfully integrated and will result in all of the positive benefits anticipated. If JPMorgan Chase is not able to integrate successfully its acquisitions, theFirms results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  JPMorgan Chase relies on its systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certainfailures could materially adversely affect the Firms operations.  The Firms businesses are dependent on its ability to process, record and monitor alarge number of increasingly complex transactions. If any of the Firms financial, accounting, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, the Firm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarlydependent on its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if a Firm employee causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulentlymanipulates the Firms operations or systems. Third parties with which the Firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the Firm, including relating to breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems or employees.Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of the Firm to operate one or more of its businesses, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, any of which could materially adversely affect theFirm.  If personal, confidential or proprietary information of customers or clients in the possession of the Firm were to be mishandled or misused the Firm couldsuffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information, eitherby fault of the Firms systems, employees, or counterparties, or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties.  TheFirm may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include, for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters or otherdamage to property or physical assets, or events arising from local or larger scale politics, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to the Firm.    In a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time, and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internalcontrols may not occur in the future. In addition, there is the risk that the Firms controls and procedures as well as business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. Any such failure could affect the Firmsoperations and could materially adversely affect its results of operations by requiring the Firm to expend significant resources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation or losses not covered by insurance.  JPMorgan Chases international operations are subject to risk of loss from unfavorable economic, political, legal and other developments.  JPMorgan Chases businesses and revenue are subject to the risks inherent in maintaining international operations and in investing and trading in securities of companiesworldwide. These risks include, among others, risk of loss from various unfavorable political, economic, legal or other developments, including social or political instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks,expropriation, nationalization, confiscation of assets, price controls, capital controls and changes in legislation relating to non-U.S. ownership. Further, various countries in which the Firm operates or invests, or in which it may do so in thefuture, have in the past experienced severe economic disruptions, including extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or negative growth, among other negative conditions. Crime, corruption and a lack of an established legal framework areadditional challenges in some of these countries, particularly in the emerging markets. Revenue from international operations and trading in non-U.S. securities may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above considerations. Theimpact of these fluctuations could be accentuated as some trading markets are smaller, less liquid and more volatile than larger markets. Also, any of the above-mentioned events or circumstances in one country can, and has in the past, affected Firmoperations and investments in another country or countries.  The emergence of a widespread health emergency or pandemic also could create economic or financialdisruption that could negatively affect the Firms revenue and operations or impair its ability to manage its businesses in certain parts of the world.  Thus,there can be no assurance the Firm will not suffer losses in the future arising from unfavorable economic, political, legal or other international events.  Damageto the Firms reputation could damage the Firms businesses.  Maintaining a positive reputation for the Firm is critical to the Firm attracting andmaintaining customers, investors and employees. Damage to its reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the Firms business and prospects. Harm to the Firms reputation can arise from numerous sources, including, among others,employee misconduct, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality, compliance failures, unethical behavior, and the activities of customers and counterparties. Further, negative publicity regardingthe Firm, whether or not true, may also result in harm to the Firms prospects.  The Firm could suffer significant reputational harm if the Firm acts when ithas, or is thought to have, conflicts of interest. For example, if the Firm does not properly manage among its various businesses     5Table of ContentsPart I        androles the flow of material non-public information of its clients, it could suffer reputational harm that could negatively affect its business and profitability. Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as theFirm expands its activities among its numerous transactions, obligations, holdings and clients. Therefore, there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to the Firm.  JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry and its business and results are significantly affected by the regulations to which it is subject.  JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated environment. The regulations to which the Firm is subject will continue to have a significant impact on the Firms operationsand the degree to which it can grow and be profitable.  Certain regulators which supervise the Firm have significant power in reviewing the Firms operations andapproving its business practices. These powers include the ability to place limitations or conditions on activities in which the Firm engages or intends to engage. Particularly in recent years, the Firms businesses have experienced increasedregulation and regulatory scrutiny, often requiring additional Firm resources. In addition, as the Firm expands its international operations, its activities will become subject to an increasing range of non-U.S. laws and regulations that impose newrequirements and limitations on the Firms operations. Further, there is no assurance that any change to the current regulatory requirements to which JPMorgan Chase is subject, or the way in which such regulatory requirements are interpreted orenforced, will not have a negative effect on the Firms ability to conduct its business or its results of operations.  JPMorgan Chase faces significant legalrisks, both from regulatory investigations and proceedings and from private actions brought against the Firm.  JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or isotherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well as investigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies. Actions brought against the Firm may result injudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm, which could materially adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operation, or cause it serious reputational harm. Particularly as aparticipant in the financial services industry, it is likely the Firm will continue to experience a high level of litigation and regulatory investigations related to its businesses and operations.  JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of its business and failure to do so may materially adversely affect itsperformance.  The Firms employees are its most important resource and, in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnelis intense. If JPMorgan Chase is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, its performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.  Government monetary policies and economic controls may have a significant adverse effect on JPMorgan Chases businesses and results of operations.  The Firms businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies that are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States, non-U.S. governments and international agencies.    For example, policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board influence, directly and indirectly, the rate of interest paid by commercial banks on their interest-bearing deposits and also may affect the value of financial instrumentsheld by the Firm. The actions of the Federal Reserve Board also determine to a significant degree the Firms cost of funds for lending and investing. In addition, these policies and conditions can adversely affect the Firms current andpotential customers and counterparties, both in the United States and abroad, which may increase the risk that such customers or counterparties default on their obligations to JPMorgan Chase or have diminished demand for the Firms products andservices.  JPMorgan Chases framework for managing its risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to the Firm.  The Firms risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss to the Firm. Types of risk to which the Firm is subject include liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk,interest rate risk, operational risk, legal and fiduciary risk, reputational risk and private equity risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to the Firms risk management strategies asthere may exist, or develop in the future, risks that the Firm has not appropriately anticipated or identified. If the Firms risk management framework proves ineffective, the Firm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materiallyadversely affected.  Many of the Firms hedging strategies and other risk management techniques have a basis in historic market behavior, and all such strategiesand techniques are based to some degree on managements subjective judgment. For example, many models used by the Firm are based on assumptions regarding correlations among prices of various asset classes or other market indicators. In times ofmarket stress or other unforeseen circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators may become correlated, or conversely, previously correlated indicators may make unrelated movements. In the past, sudden market movements or unanticipated orunidentified market or economic movements have in some circumstances limited the effectiveness of the Firms risk management strategies, causing the Firm to incur losses. This may occur again in the future. In addition, as the Firmsbusinesses grow and the markets in which they operate continue to evolve, the Firms risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. For example, there is the risk that the credit and market risks associatedwith new products or new business strategies may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed. There can be no assurance that the Firms risk management framework, including its underlying assumptions or strategies, will at all timesbe accurate and effective.    Finally, the Firms risk management strategies may not beeffective because in a difficult or less liquid market environment other market participants may be attempting to use the same or similar strategies to deal with the difficult market conditions. In such circumstances, it may be difficult for theFirm to reduce its risk positions due to the activity of such other market participants.  If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, its businesscould be negatively affected.  The Firms liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses, grow and be profitable. A compromise to theFirms liquidity can have a significant negative effect on the Firm. Some potential conditions that could negatively affect the Firms liquidity include illiquid or volatile markets, diminished access to capital markets, unforeseen  6 Table of Contents cash orcapital requirements (including, among others, commitments to special purpose entities (SPEs) or other entities that may be triggered) and difficulty or inability to sell assets. These conditions may be caused by events over which theFirm has little or no control, including, for example, sudden or unanticipated contraction of the credit or other market or economic downturns. Further, in a period of difficult credit or other markets, the Firm may be forced to fund its operationsat a higher cost or it may be unable to raise as much funding as it needs to support its business activities. This could cause the Firm to curtail its business activities while incurring higher costs for funding.  The credit ratings of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are important in order to maintain the Firms liquidity. A reduction in the Firms credit ratings, dependingon the severity, could potentially increase borrowing costs, limit access to capital markets, require cash payments or collateral posting, and permit termination of certain contracts to which the Firm is a party. Reduction in the ratings of certainSPEs or other entities to which the Firm has a funding or other commitment could also negatively affect the Firms liquidity where such ratings changes lead, directly or indirectly, to the Firm being required to purchase assets or otherwiseprovide funding.  As a holding company, JPMorgan Chase relies on the earnings of its subsidiaries for its cash flow and consequent ability to pay dividends andsatisfy its obligations. These payments by subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, loans or other payments. Several of the Firms principal subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy requirements or other regulatory or contractualrestrictions on their ability to provide such payments. Limitations in the payments the Firm receives from its subsidiaries could negatively affect the Firms liquidity position.  The Firm could be negatively affected in a situation in which other financial institutions are negatively impacted.  The Firm could beaffected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial services institutions. Financial services institutions that deal with each other are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. While theFirm has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, it routinely executes a high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutualand hedge funds and other institutional clients, resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall. As a result, a default by, or even concerns about, one or more financial services institutionscould lead to significant market-wide liquidity problems, or losses or defaults by other institutions, including the Firm.  Derivative and other transactions mayexpose the Firm to unexpected risk and potential losses.  The Firm is party to numerous derivative and other transactions, including transactions that require thephysical settlement or delivery of securities, commodities or other obligations the Firm does not own. If the Firm is not able to obtain those securities, commodities or other obligations within the required timeframe for delivery, this could causethe Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it and could result in settlement delays which could damage the Firms reputation and ability to transact future business.    Derivative and other transactionsentered into with third parties are not always confirmed by counterparties on a timely basis. While a transaction remains unconfirmed, the Firm is subject to heightened credit and operational risk and in the event of a default the Firm may find thecontract more difficult to enforce. In addition, as new and more complex derivative products are created, disputes regarding the terms of the underlying contracts could arise, which could force the Firm to incur unexpected costs and impair itsability to manage effectively its risk exposures from these products.  The Firms commodities activities are subject to extensive regulation, potentialcatastrophic events and environmental risks and regulation that may expose it to significant cost and liability.  In connection with the commodities activities ofthe Firms Investment Bank, the Firm engages in the storage, transportation, marketing or trading of several commodities, including metals, agricultural products, crude oil, oil products, natural gas, electric power, emission credits, coal,freight, and related products and indices. As a result of these activities, the Firm is subject to extensive and evolving energy, commodities, environmental, and other governmental laws and regulations. The Firm expects laws and regulationsaffecting its commodities business to expand in scope and complexity. The Firm may incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws and regulations and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantialcivil and criminal fines and penalties. The Firms commodities business also further exposes it to the risk of unforeseen and catastrophic events, including natural disasters, leaks, spills, explosions, release of toxic substances, fires,accidents on land and at sea, wars, and terrorist attacks that could result in personal injuries, loss of life, property damage, and suspension of operations. The Firm attempts to mitigate its risks but its actions may not prove adequate to addressevery contingency. In addition, insurance covering some of these risks may not be available, and the proceeds, if any, from insurance recovery may not be adequate to cover liabilities with respect to particular incidents. As a result, theFirms financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by such events.  The Firms financial statements are based in part onassumptions and estimates which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future.  Pursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United Statesof America (U.S. GAAP), the Firm is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing its financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigations and the fair value of certainassets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Firms financial statements are incorrect, the Firm may experience material losses.  For example, the Firm makes judgments in connection with its consolidation analysis of its SPEs. If it is later determined that non-consolidated SPEs should be consolidated, this could negatively affect the Firms Consolidated balancesheet, related funding, requirements, capital ratios and, if the SPEs assets include unrealized losses, could require the Firm to recognize those losses.   7 Table of ContentsPart I    Certain of the Firms financial instruments, including trading assets and liabilities, available-for-sale (AFS) securities, certain loans, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), private equity investments, structurednotes and certain repurchase and resale agreements, among other items, require a determination of their fair value in order to prepare the Firms financial statements. Where quoted market prices are not available, the Firm may make fair valuedeterminations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on management judgment. Some of these and other Firm assets and liabilities may have no direct observable price levels, making their valuationparticularly subjective, being based on significant estimation and judgment"
4,JPM,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,2007-03-01,">Item 1A: Risk factorsThe following discussion sets forth some of the more important risk factors thatcould affect the Firms business and operations. Other factors that could affectthe Firms business and operations are discussed in theForward looking statements section on page 147. However, factors besides those discussed below, in theMD&A or elsewhere in this or other of the Firms reports filed or furnished withthe SEC also could adversely affect the Firms business or results. The readershould not consider any descriptions of such factors to be a complete set of allpotential risks that may face the Firm.JPMorgan Chases results of operations could be adversely affectedby U.S. and international markets and economic conditions.The Firms businesses are affected by conditions in the global financial marketsand economic conditions generally both in the U.S. and internationally. Factorssuch as the liquidity of the global financial markets; the level and volatility ofequity prices, interest rates and commodities prices; investor sentiment; inflation; and the availability and cost of credit can affect significantly the activitylevel of clients with respect to size, number and timing of transactions involving the Firms investment banking business, including its underwriting andadvisory businesses. These factors also may affect the realization of cashreturns from the Firms private equity business. A market downturn would likely lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that the Firm executes for itscustomers and, therefore, lead to a decline in the revenues it receives fromtrading commissions and spreads. In addition, lower market volatility willreduce trading and arbitrage opportunities, which could lead to lower tradingrevenues. Higher interest rates or weakness in the markets also could adversely affect the number or size of underwritings the Firm manages on behalf ofclients and affect the willingness of financial sponsors or investors to participate in loan syndications or underwritings managed by JPMorgan Chase.The Firm generally maintains large trading portfolios in the fixed income, currency, commodity and equity markets and has significant investment positions,including merchant banking investments held by its private equity business. Therevenues derived from mark-to-market values of the Firms business are affectedby many factors, including its credit standing; its success inproprietary positioning; volatility in interest rates and equity and debt markets; and other economic and business factors. JPMorgan Chase anticipates that revenues relating to itstrading will experience volatility and there can be no assurance that suchvolatility relating to the above factors or other conditions could not materiallyadversely affect the Firms earnings.The fees JPMorgan Chase earns for managing third-party assets are alsodependent upon general economic conditions. For example, a higher level ofU.S. or non-U.S. interest rates or a downturn in trading markets could affect thevaluations of the third-party assets managed by the Firm, which, in turn, couldaffect the Firms revenues. Moreover, even in the absence of a market downturn,below-market or sub-par performance by JPMorgan Chases investment managementbusinesses could result in outflows of assets under management and supervisionand, therefore, reduce the fees the Firm receives.The creditquality of JPMorgan Chases on-balance sheet and off-balance sheetassets may be affected by business conditions. In a poor economic environmentthere is a greater likelihood that more of the Firms customers or counterpartiescould become delinquent on their loans or other obligations to JPMorgan Chasewhich, in turn, could result in a higher level of charge-offs and provision forcredit losses, all of which would adversely affect the Firms earnings.The Firms consumer businesses are particularly affected by domestic economicconditions that can materially adversely affect such businesses and the Firm.Such conditions include U.S. interest rates; the rate of unemployment; the levelof consumer confidence; changes in consumer spending; and the number ofpersonal bankruptcies, among others. Certain changes to these conditions candiminish demand for businesses products and services, or increase the cost toprovide such products and services. In addition, a deterioration in consumerscredit quality could lead to an increase in loan delinquencies and higher netcharge-offs, which could adversely affect the Firms earnings.There is increasing competition in the financial services industry whichmay adversely affect JPMorgan Chases results of operations.JPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive environment and expectscompetitive conditions to continue to intensify as continued merger activity inthe financial services industry produces larger, better-capitalized and moregeographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array offinancial products and services at more competitive prices.The Firm also faces an increasing array of competitors. Competitors include otherbanks, brokerage firms, investment banking companies, merchant banks, insurancecompanies, mutual fund companies, credit card companies, mortgage bankingcompanies, hedge funds, trust companies, securities processingcompanies, automobile financing companies,leasing companies, e-commerce and other Internet-based companies, and avariety of other financial services and advisory companies. Technologicaladvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally were bankingproducts, and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronicand Internet-based financial solutions, including electronic securities trading.JPMorgan Chases businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality andvariety of its products and services, transaction execution, innovation, technology,reputation and price. Ongoing or increased competition in any one or all of theseareas may put downward pressure on prices for the Firms products and servicesor may cause the Firm to lose market share. Increased competitionalso mayrequire the Firm to make additional capital investment in its businesses in orderto remain competitive. These investments may increase expenses or mayrequire the Firm to extend more of its capital on behalf of clients in order toexecute larger, more competitive transactions. There can be no assurance thatthe significant and increasing competition in the financial services industry willnot materially adversely affect JPMorgan Chases future results of operations.4 Part IJPMorgan Chases acquisitions and integration of acquired businessesmay not result in all of the benefits anticipated.The Firm has in the past and may in the future seek to grow its business byacquiring other businesses. There can be no assurance that the Firms acquisitionswill have the anticipated positive results, including results relating to: the totalcost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amountof longer-term cost savings; or the overall performance of the combined entity.Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, sometimesincluding combining relevant accounting and data processing systems andmanagement controls, as well as managing relevant relationships withemployees, clients,suppliers and other business partners.There is no assurance that JPMorgan Chases most recent acquisitions or thatany businesses acquired in the future will be successfully integrated and willresult in all of the positive benefits anticipated. If JPMorgan Chase is not ableto integrate successfully its past and any future acquisitions, there is the risk theFirms results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.JPMorgan Chase relies on its systems, employees and certaincounterparties, and certain failures could materially adversely affectthe Firms operations.The Firms businesses are dependent on its ability to process a large number ofincreasingly complex transactions. If any of the Firms financial, accounting, orother data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, theFirm could be materially adversely affected. The Firm is similarly dependenton its employees. The Firm could be materially adversely affected if a Firmemployee causes a significant operational break down or failure, either as aresult of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Firms operations or systems. Third parties with whichthe Firm does business could also be sources of operational risk to the Firm,including relating to break downs or failures of such parties own systems oremployees. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability ofthe Firm to operate one or more of its businesses, potential liability to clients,reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could materiallyadversely affect the Firm.The Firm also may be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arisingfrom events that are wholly or partially beyond its control, which may include,for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages ornatural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, or events arising from local orregional politics, including terrorist acts. Such disruptions may give rise tolosses in service to customers and loss or liability to the Firm.In a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficienciesin internal control over financial reporting may occur from time totime, and there is no assurance that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls may not occur in the future.In addition, there is the risk that the Firms controls and procedures as well asbusiness continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. Anysuch failure could affect the Firms operations and could materially adverselyaffect its results of operations by requiring the Firm to expend significantresources to correct the defect, as well as by exposing the Firm to litigation orlosses not covered by insurance.JPMorgan Chases non-U.S. trading activities and operations aresubject to risk of loss, particularly in emerging markets.The Firm does business throughout the world, including in developing regions ofthe world commonly known as emerging markets. In the past, many emergingmarket countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions,including devaluations of their currencies and capital and currency exchangecontrols, as well as low or negative economic growth.JPMorgan Chases businesses and revenues derived from non-U.S. operationsare subject to risk of loss from various unfavorable political, economic and legaldevelopments, including currency fluctuations, social instability, changes ingovernmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization,confiscation of assets and changes in legislation relating to non-U.S. ownership.The Firm also invests in the securities of corporations located in non-U.S.jurisdictions, including emerging markets. Revenues from the trading of non-U.S. securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of theabove considerations. The impact of these fluctuations could be accentuatedas non-U.S. trading markets (particularly in emerging markets) are usuallysmaller, less liquid and more volatile than U.S. trading markets. There can beno assurance the Firm will not suffer losses in the future arising from its non-U.S. trading activities or operations.If JPMorgan Chase does not successfully handle issues that may arisein the conduct of its business and operations, its reputation could bedamaged, which could in turn negatively affect its business.The Firms ability to attract and retain customers and transact with its counter-parties could be adversely affected to the extent its reputation is damaged. Thefailure of the Firm to deal, or to appear to fail to deal, with various issues thatcould give rise to reputational risk could cause harm to the Firm and its businessprospects. These issues include, but are not limited to, appropriately dealing withpotential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues,money-laundering, privacy, record-keeping, sales and trading practices, and theproper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risksinherent in its products. The failure to address appropriately these issues couldmake the Firms clients unwilling to do business with the Firm, which couldadversely affect the Firms results.JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated industry and itsbusiness and results are significantly affected by the regulations towhich it is subject.JPMorgan Chase operates within a highly regulated environment. The regulationsto which the Firm is subject will continue to have a significant impact on theFirms operations and the degree to which it can grow and be profitable.Certain regulators to which the Firm is subject have significant power in reviewingthe Firms operations and approving its business practices. Particularly in recentyears, the Firms businesses have experienced increased regulation and regulatoryscrutiny, often requiring additional Firm resources. In addition, as the Firmexpands its international operations, its activities will become subject to anincreasing range of non-U.S. laws and regulations that likely will impose newrequirements and limitations on certain of the Firms operations. There is noassurance that any change to the current regulatory requirements to whichJPMorgan Chase is subject, or the way in which such regulatory requirementsare interpreted or enforced, will not have a negative effect on the Firms abilityto conduct its business or its results of operations.JPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks, both from regulatoryinvestigations and proceedings and from private actions broughtagainst the Firm.JPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise involved invarious legal proceedings, includingclass actions and other litigation or disputes with third parties, as well asinvestigations or proceedings brought by regulatory agencies. These or otherfuture actions brought against the Firm may result in judgments, settlements,fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Firm,5 Part Iwhich couldmaterially adversely affect the Firms business, financial condition or results of operation,or cause it serious reputational harm.JPMorgan Chases ability to attract and retain qualified employeesis critical to the success of its business and failure to do so maymaterially adversely affect its performance.The Firms employees are its most important resource and, in many areas of thefinancial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. If JPMorganChase is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, its performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.Government monetary policies and economic controls may have asignificant adverse affect on JPMorgan Chases businesses and resultsof operations.The Firms businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policiesthat are adopted by various regulatory authorities of the United States, non-U.S.governments and international agencies. For example, policies and regulations ofthe Federal Reserve Board influence, directly and indirectly, the rate of interestpaid by commercial banks on their interest-bearing deposits and also may affectthe value of financial instruments held by the Firm. The actions of the FederalReserve Board also determine to a significant degree the Firms cost of funds forlending and investing. In addition, these policies and conditions can adverselyaffect the Firms customers and counterparties, both in the United States andabroad, which may increase the risk that such customers or counterpartiesdefault on their obligations to JPMorgan Chase.JPMorgan Chases framework for managing its risks may not beeffective in mitigating risk and loss to the Firm.JPMorgan Chases risk management framework is made up of various processesand strategies to manage the Firms risk exposure. Types of risk to which theFirm is subject include liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk,operational risk, legal and reputational risk, fiduciary risk and private equity risk,among others. There can be no assurance that the Firms framework to managerisk, including such frameworks underlying assumptions, will be effective underall conditions and circumstances.As the Firms businesses grow and the markets in which they operate continueto evolve, the Firms risk management framework may not always keep sufficientpace with those changes. For example, as the derivatives markets continue togrow and the Firms participation in these markets expands, there is the riskthat the credit and market risks associated with new products may not be appropriately identified, monitored or managed or that the documentation of thesetrades by the Firm or its counterparties will not keep up with the increased paceof settlements. In addition, in the case of credit derivatives that require physicalsettlement of transactions, many market participants, including the Firm, do notalways hold the underlying securities or loans relating to such derivatives; if theFirm is not able to obtain those securities or loans within the required timeframefor delivery, this could cause the Firm to forfeit payments otherwise due to it.If the Firms risk management framework proves ineffective, whether because itdoes not keep pace with changing Firm or market circumstances or otherwise, theFirm could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.If JPMorgan Chase does not effectively manage its liquidity, itsbusiness could be negatively affected.The Firms liquidity is critical to its ability to operate its businesses, grow and beprofitable. A compromise to the Firms liquidity could therefore have a negativeeffect on the Firm. Potential conditions that could negatively affect the Firmsliquidity include diminished access to capital markets, unforeseen cash or capitalrequirements and an inability to sell assets.The Firms credit ratings are an important part of maintaining its liquidity, and areduction in the Firms credit ratings would also negatively affect the Firmsliquidity. A credit ratings downgrade, depending on its severity, could potentiallyincrease borrowing costs, limit access to capital markets, require cash payments orcollateral posting, and permit termination of certain contracts to which the Firm is a party.Future events may be different than those anticipated by JPMorganChases management assumptions and estimates, which may causeunexpected losses in the future.Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, the Firm is required to use certain estimates in preparingits financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine loan lossreserves, reserves related to future litigation, and the fair value of certain assetsand liabilities, among other items. Should the Firms determined values for suchitems prove substantially inaccurate, the Firm may experience unexpected lossesthat could be material"
