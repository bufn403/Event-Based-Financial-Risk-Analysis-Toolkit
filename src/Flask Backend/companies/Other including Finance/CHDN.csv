14,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2024-02-21,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Economic and External RisksOur business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, public health threats, civil unrest, and inclement weather, including as a result of climate changeOur operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks, which is subject to the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events that may discourage attendance or expose us to substantial liability. Terrorist activity, including acts of domestic terrorism, civil unrest, or other actions that discourage attendance at other locations, or even the threat of such activity, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions, safety, and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, could result in reduced attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and at our other locations. A major epidemic or pandemic, outbreak of a contagious equine disease, or the threat of such an event, could also adversely affect attendance and could impact the supply chain for our major construction projects resulting in higher costs and delays of the projects. For example, the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in the temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly owned gaming properties, certain wholly owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments. While we are constantly evaluating our security precautions in an effort to ensure the safety of the public, no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances of avoiding potential liabilities. Since horse racing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes, and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends. Extreme weather events that are linked to rising temperatures, changing global weather patterns, sea, land, and air temperatures, as well as sea levels, rain, and snow could result in increased occurrence and severity of adverse weather events. Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions, or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters, and other casualties. The occurrence or threat of any such extraordinary event at our locations, particularly at Churchill Downs Racetrack during Kentucky Derby and Oaks week, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.Our business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers’ discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations Economic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers’ discretionary spending, including:•Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers’ disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.  •Inflationary periods negatively impact consumers' discretionary income and could reduce the amount of income previously used for gaming and entertainment.•Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  •Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets. For example, reduced wagering levels, and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, our online wagering sites and gaming and wagering facilities, and reduced consumer spending overall.Our access to and the cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends. Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain. Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial, and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the horse racing, online wagering, and casino industries. Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on 16our operations. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities, and in evaluating our tax positions. It is not possible to determine the likelihood, extent or impact of any future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. Strategic RisksA lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses or any deterioration in our reputation could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersHorse racing, pari-mutuel wagering, and casino gaming businesses depend on the public perception of integrity and fairness in their operations. To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated. A lack or loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business. Acts of fraud or cheating in our gaming businesses using counterfeit chips, covert schemes, and other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees, may be attempted or committed by our gaming customers with the aim of increasing their winnings. Our gaming customers, visitors, and employees may also commit crimes such as theft to obtain chips not belonging to them. We have taken measures to safeguard our interests including the implementation of systems, processes, and technologies to mitigate against these risks, extensive employee training, surveillance, security, and investigation operations and adoption of appropriate security features on our chips such as embedded radio frequency identification tags. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or detecting such culpable behavior and schemes in a timely manner and the relevant insurance we have obtained may not be sufficient to cover our losses depending on the incident, which could result in losses to our gaming operations and generate negative publicity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and cash flows.Other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights, and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us, our properties, or our industries, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention, or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.An inability to attract and retain key and highly qualified and skilled personnel, as well as disruptions in the general labor market, could impact our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization. If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business could be impacted. Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth. Certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impact our operations.  We have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. Increased employee turnover, changes in the availability of our workers, or labor shortages in our supply chain could result in increased costs and impact our ability to fully staff our operations, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Our Company faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseWe face an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants operating from physical locations and/or through online or mobile platforms, including destination casinos, riverboat casinos; dockside casinos; land-based casinos; video lottery; iGaming; sports betting; gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois; gaming at truck stops, gas stations, and other establishments in certain states, such as Louisiana, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky; historical horse racing in Kentucky; sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos; fantasy sports; Native American gaming; and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, illegal slot machines and skill 17games, fantasy sports and internet, or mobile-based gaming platforms, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and/or play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker, sports betting, and other varieties of iGaming in a number of states. Expansion of land-based and iGaming in other jurisdictions (both regulated and unregulated) could further compete with our operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have properties, have recently legalized, implemented, and expanded gaming. Established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional tax revenue sources of state governments by authorizing or expanding gaming in the states that we operate in or the states that are adjacent to or near our existing properties. New, relocated, or expanded operations by other persons could increase competition for our operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.Our operations also face competition from other leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts, and travel.Our Churchill Downs Racetrack and the Kentucky Derby may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, attendance, wagering, and sponsorships  Our Churchill Downs Racetrack is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races. If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Live and Historical Racing segment. In addition, accidents and adverse events that may occur at our racetrack and any reputational damage as a result may negatively impact attendance at our live horse races. If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The number and level of sponsorships are important to the success of the Kentucky Derby. Our ability to retain sponsors, acquire new sponsors, and compete for sponsorships and advertising dollars could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We are subject to significant risks associated with our equity investments, strategic alliances, and other third-party agreementsWe pursue certain license opportunities, development projects, and other strategic business opportunities through equity investments, joint ventures, license arrangements, and other alliances with third parties.  Our equity investments are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our co-investors and therefore, we do not unilaterally control the applicable entity or other initiatives. The terms of the equity investments and the rights of our co-investors may preclude us from taking actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company. Disagreements with our co-investors could result in delays in project development, including construction delays, and ultimate failure of the project. Our co-investors also may not be able to provide capital to the applicable entity on the terms agreed to or at all, and the applicable entity may be unable to obtain external financing to finance their operations. Also, our ability to exit the equity investments may be subject to contractual and other limitations.With any third-party arrangement, there is a risk that our partners’ economic, business, or legal interests or objectives may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements and/or failure of the applicable project or initiative. We are also subject to risks relating to our co-investors’ failure to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners and changes in the ownership of any of our co-investors.Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionOur TwinSpires segment and gaming and historical racing properties are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products. Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network. It may be difficult to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources. Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features. While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner. Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.  18The concentration and evolution of the slot machine and HRM manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usA significant amount of our revenue is attributable to slot, HRM, VLTs, and video poker machines operated by us at our properties, and there are a limited number of slot machine and HRM manufacturers servicing the industry. It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests. A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector. Recently, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation and slot machine manufacturers have occasionally refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.We rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk. Our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks, and the failure to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial conditionOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties. If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted. For example, the Interstate Horseracing Act, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the ""Horsemen’s Groups""). These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races. We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis. The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, the Horsemen's Groups on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third-party races could have a material adverse impact on our business, as such failure will result in our inability to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting. From time to time, certain Horsemen’s Groups have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks. Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also have written agreements with certain Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in certain states that may be required to operate such gaming.  We have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities, OTBs, and ADWs. From time to time, we may be unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us. As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks. The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We intend to focus on market access and our retail operations for our TwinSpires sports betting business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will generate sufficient returns on our investmentDuring the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting. Sports betting has been authorized and is operational in thirty-eight states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2023. Additional states may legalize sports betting in the future. Each state has different structures for the number of allowable industry participants, license fees, taxes, and other operational requirements. The market for sports betting and online gaming is rapidly evolving and highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors. The success of our retail and online sports books is dependent on several factors that are beyond our control, including:•the timing of adoption of regulations authorizing betting and gaming activities, •operating requirements and other restrictions,19•the number of allowable industry participants,•the license fees and tax rates,•our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market,•the potential that the market does not develop as we anticipate,•our ability to compete with new entrants in the market,•changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, and•the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment.There can be no assurance as to the returns that we will receive from TwinSpires sports betting business.Operational RisksOur business is subject to online security risk, including cybersecurity breaches. Loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers’ personal information, could lead to government enforcement actions or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our businessWe receive, process, store, and use personal information and other customer and employee data by maintaining and transmitting customers’ personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists, and reservations information. Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities.  There are numerous federal, state, and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, and such privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve. Many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA""), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, providing California consumers greater control of the information collected, stored, and sold, and other states are considering similar legislation. The CCPA provides a private right of action (in addition to statutory damages) for California residents whose sensitive personal information was breached as a result of a business’s violation of its duty to reasonably secure such information. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws or our privacy policies may subject us to significant liabilities, including governmental enforcement actions or litigation. We have experienced cyber attacks in the past. While these attacks did not have a significant impact to the Company, we may continue to experience such attacks. Our systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or joint venture partner, may not be successful. Interruptions in our services or a breach of a customer’s secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, which could permanently harm our reputation and brand. These interruptions could also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our casinos. Such incidents could give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines, and other penalties, which could be significant. We attempt to protect against this risk with our property and business interruption insurance, which covers damage or interruption of our systems, although there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential losses.Third parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our privacy policies, and such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business. We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association’s contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties. If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Security breaches, computer malware, and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks. Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks. Moreover, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure 20to maintain performance, reliability, security, and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. As threats related to cyber attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. We have insurance coverage for protection against cyber attacks, which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations, and legal advice. This insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.Our operations rely heavily on technology services, and catastrophic events and system failures with respect to these technology services could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsWe rely on information technology and other systems to manage our business. A disruption or failure in our technology systems or operations in the event of a cyber attack, major earthquake, weather event, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas. Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of our or our customers’ information, litigation, and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of our technology systems could impact our operations. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, subject us to litigation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines, and other penalties, which could be significant. Our online wagering, HRM and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware. We have built certain redundancies into our systems to attempt to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage. Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our websites and our services could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  We may not be able to identify and / or complete acquisitions, divestitures, development of new venues or the expansion of existing facilities on time, on budget or as plannedWe pursue acquisitions, divestitures, development of new venues, and expansion of existing facilities to grow our business. We face challenges in identifying and completing acquisitions or divestiture opportunities or other development or expansion projects that fit with our strategic objectives. These projects require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt. These projects also have risks associated with managing and integrating the acquisition or expansion project.Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure related to these projects could lead to delays and higher project costs. The acquisition or divestiture of businesses may be delayed by external factors beyond our control including federal, state, and local issues.  The impact of these risks may cause us not to realize the intended benefits of these capital investments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future. The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial, and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns. We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings, and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all. Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources. The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results. These costs could include the following: •restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions,21•non-recurring transaction costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees, and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities, and•costs of imposing financial and management controls and operating, administrative and information systems.We perform financial, operational, and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate these businesses successfully and integrate them into our existing operations. In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth,•the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition,•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products,•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third-party insurers,•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy,•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience,•the potential loss of key employees or customers,•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit employees with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses, and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The development of new venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns, and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct, and open hotels, casinos, other gaming venues, or racetracks in response to opportunities that may arise. For example, we've announced multiple major multi-year capital investments to transform key areas of Churchill Downs Racetrack, as well as other capital investments such The Rose Dumfries, Owensboro Racing & Gaming, a charitable gaming facility in New Hampshire, and the Terre Haute Casino Resort. Future development projects may require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, we may not receive the intended benefits of such capital investments. Ownership and development of our real estate requires significant expenditures and ownership of such properties is subject to risk, including risks related to environmental liabilities We own extensive real estate holdings and make significant capital investments to grow our operations. All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail, or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants. Significant expenditures, including property taxes, debt repayments, maintenance costs, insurance costs, and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property. Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission, and disposal of hazardous materials. Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination. Some of our facilities are subject to CAFO regulations. If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions. Enforcement of such regulations have been receiving increased governmental attention and compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures (including with respect to fines).22Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport, and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationPersonal injuries and injuries to horses have occurred during races or workouts, and may continue to occur, which could subject us to negative publicity and / or litigation. Negative publicity may lead some customers to avoid the Company’s properties or could cause horse owners to avoid racing their horses at our racetracks. Any litigation resulting from injuries at our properties could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. We buy insurance for all our racetracks; however, our coverage may not be sufficient for all losses. Due to the potential impact of negative publicity and inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives, or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions, and criminal sanctions.Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customersWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (""EFT"") and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming and other wagering losses through chargebacks. Our control procedures to protect from chargebacks may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans and limit our operational flexibilitySome of our employees are represented by labor unions. A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees. We may experience additional union activity in the future. Any such union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our business and result in significant costs.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe face risks related to pending or future legal proceedings and other actions  From time to time, we are a party in various lawsuits and judicial and governmental actions. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these lawsuits and actions which can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits or actions, which could result in settlements, costs, or damages that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. Such matters may include investigations or litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, state, and federal agencies, stockholders, and 23employees relating to intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial, or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We have also been subject to claims in cases concerning or similar to class action allegations. Plaintiffs in such lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. We evaluate all the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the potential losses we may incur. In many cases, including class action matters, we may not be able to estimate the potential losses we will incur and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.Our operations are highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessWe conduct live and historical pari-mutuel wagering, online pari-mutuel wagering through ADWs, casino gaming, and sports betting operations, which are subject to extensive state and for some local regulation. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules, and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew, or revoke a license or registration to conduct our operations or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in the Company.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing governmental licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals necessary to operate our existing businesses or demonstrate suitability to obtain any licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. As we expand our operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits, and approvals from authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful.  Our Live and Historical Racing segment is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized pari-mutuel wagering in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing (including HRM) facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities. We have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits, and approvals necessary for operation. However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses. The failure to obtain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our business licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct or our racing (including HRM) operation. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location, or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of HRMs. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating pari-mutuel laws or regulations. For example, individual plaintiffs associated with video poker and truck stops in Louisiana are challenging the constitutionality of the Louisiana 2021 HHR Act which may adversely impact Fair Ground’s historical racing operations.   TwinSpires accepts ADW wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund accounts from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device, or through the Internet pursuant to the Interstate Horseracing Act and relevant licenses and consents. The online horse racing wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing ADW pari-mutuel wagering vary from state to state. State attorney generals, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state laws, federal laws, constitutional principles, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.   States may take affirmative action to make ADW expressly unlawful. We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits, and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our online horse racing wagering business or in any legal challenge to the validity of any restrictions on ADW. Legal challenges and regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly, and uncertain.     Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states or increase competition for online wagering. Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies. The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 24Financial RisksOur debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain several covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares,•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments,•make certain investments,•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all our assets,•create liens on certain assets,•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates, and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.Any failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants in our debt facilities and other indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios. A failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition. In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us,•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit, or•could require us to apply all our available cash to repay these borrowings.We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities. If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.Increases to interest rates (due to inflation or otherwise), disruptions in the credit markets, or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.While we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, interest rate increases, disruption in the credit markets, or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. During inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense of our borrowings. Primarily in response to concerns about inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve has significantly raised its benchmark federal funds rate, which has led to increases in interest rates in the credit markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve may continue to raise the federal funds rate, which will likely lead to higher interest rates in the credit markets and the possibility of lower asset values, slowing economic growth and/or possibly leading to a recession. We are exposed to increases in interest rates on our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our credit facility and our term loans. Therefore, interest rate increases, due to inflation or otherwise, could, increase our interest expense under these variable-rate facilities in the short-term and increase our financing costs as we refinance our existing variable-rate and fixed-rate long-term borrowings in the long term, or we could incur additional interest expense related to the issuance of incremental debt. These increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, negatively impact our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in our Credit Agreement, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, and development activity.Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital.25Our insurance costs may increase, we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future, and the extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our operating properties in the event of inclement weather and casualty events, all could adversely affect our businessWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain additional exclusions from our coverage. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, we could be at risk for increased potential losses, which could be substantial. Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these requirements, an event of default could result under these debt instruments or material agreements. Portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure. After carefully weighing the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks, as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage, we may opt to retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies. Retained risks are associated with deductible limits or self-insured retentions, partial self-insurance programs, and insurance policy coverage ceilings.Flooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes, or other weather conditions could adversely affect our casino and horse racing locations. We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, which coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions, and limits on maximum benefits. We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters. If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of weather conditions in the future, or if weather conditions adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.We have ""all risk"" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism). Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits and certain exclusions, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our obligations"
2,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2023-02-22,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Economic and External RisksOur business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, public health threats, civil unrest, and inclement weather, including as a result of climate changeOur operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks, which is subject to the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events that may discourage attendance or expose us to substantial liability.  Terrorist activity, including acts of domestic terrorism, civil unrest or other actions that discourage attendance at other locations, or even the threat of such activity, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions, safety and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, could result in reduced attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and at our other locations.  A major epidemic or pandemic, outbreak of a contagious equine disease, or the threat of such an event, could also adversely affect attendance and could impact the supply chain for our major construction projects resulting in higher costs and delays of the projects.  The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in the temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly-owned gaming properties, certain wholly-owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments.  While we are constantly evaluating our security precautions in an effort to ensure the safety of the public, no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances of avoiding potential liabilities. Since horse racing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends.  Extreme weather events that are linked to rising temperatures, changing global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperatures, as well as sea levels, rain and snow could result in increased occurrence and severity of adverse weather events.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  The occurrence or threat of any such extraordinary event at our locations, particularly at Churchill Downs Racetrack and Kentucky Derby and Oaks week, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.Our business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers’ discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations Economic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers’ discretionary spending, including:•Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers’ disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.  •Inflationary periods negatively impact consumers' discretionary income and could reduce the amount of income previously used for gaming and entertainment.•Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  •Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, our online wagering sites and gaming and wagering facilities, and reduced consumer spending overall.Our access to and the cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends.  Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time.  From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the horse racing, online wagering and casino industries.  Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining our provision 15for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions.  It is not possible to determine the likelihood, extent or impact of any future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. The current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.  Other major public health issues could adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results in the futureIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic.  Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the continued effects of the COVID-19 virus, including the emergence of variant strains, and the extent of and effectiveness of responses taken on international, national and local levels.  The long-term impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and world economies and continued impact on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted.The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by national, state, and local authorities in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks.  During the course of the pandemic, we experienced temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly-owned gaming properties, certain wholly-owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments. The introduction of vaccine and facemask mandates in certain locations also impacted the number of customers visiting our properties. The Company continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company's long-term operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company's control, including the timing, extent, trajectory, and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution, and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy. Strategic RisksA lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses or any deterioration in our reputation could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersHorse racing, pari-mutuel wagering, and casino gaming businesses depend on the public perception of integrity and fairness in their operations.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A lack or loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business. Acts of fraud or cheating in our gaming businesses through the use of counterfeit chips, covert schemes and other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees, may be attempted or committed by our gaming customers with the aim of increasing their winnings.  Our gaming customers, visitors and employees may also commit crimes such as theft in order to obtain chips not belonging to them.  We have taken measures to safeguard our interests including the implementation of systems, processes and technologies to mitigate against these risks, extensive employee training, surveillance, security and investigation operations and adoption of appropriate security features on our chips such as embedded radio frequency identification tags.  Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or detecting such culpable behavior and schemes in a timely manner and the relevant insurance we have obtained may not be sufficient to cover our losses depending on the incident, which could result in losses to our gaming operations and generate negative publicity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows.Other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities.  Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us or our properties.  It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate.  Negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us, our properties, or our industries, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.16An inability to attract and retain key and highly qualified and skilled personnel, as well as disruptions in the general labor market, could impact our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization.  If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business could be impacted. Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate.  As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled employees.  We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth. Certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impact our operations.  We have observed an increasingly competitive labor market.  Increased employee turnover, changes in the availability of our workers, or labor shortages in our supply chain could result in increased costs and impact our ability to fully staff our operations, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Our Company faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseWe face an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants operating from physical locations and/or through online or mobile platforms, including destination casinos, riverboat casinos; dockside casinos; land-based casinos; video lottery; iGaming; sports betting; gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois; gaming at truck stop establishments in certain states, such as Louisiana and Pennsylvania; historical horse racing in Kentucky; sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos; fantasy sports; Native American gaming; and other forms of gaming in the U.S.  Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, illegal slot machines and skill games, fantasy sports and internet or mobile-based gaming platforms, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and/or play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker, sports betting and other varieties of iGaming in a number of states.  Expansion of land-based and iGaming in other jurisdictions (both regulated and unregulated) could further compete with our traditional and iGaming operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada.  Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have properties, have recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming.  Established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations.  Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional tax revenue sources of state governments by authorizing or expanding gaming in the states that we operate in or the states that are adjacent to or near our existing properties.  New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons could increase competition for our operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.Our operations also face competition from other leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel.Our Churchill Downs Racetrack and the Kentucky Derby may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, attendance, wagering, and sponsorships  Our Churchill Downs Racetrack is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races.  If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Live and Historical Racing segment.  In addition, accidents and adverse events that may occur at our racetrack and any reputational damage as a result may negatively impact attendance at our live horse races.  If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The number and level of sponsorships are important to the success of the Kentucky Derby.  Our ability to retain sponsors, acquire new sponsors, and compete for sponsorships and advertising dollars could have a material adverse impact on our business.  17We are subject to significant risks associated with our equity investments, strategic alliances, and other third-party agreementsWe pursue certain license opportunities, development projects and other strategic business opportunities through equity investments, joint ventures, license arrangements and other alliances with third parties.  Our equity investments are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our co-investors and therefore, we do not unilaterally control the applicable entity or other initiatives.  The terms of the equity investments and the rights of our co-investors may preclude us from taking actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company.  Disagreements with our co-investors could result in delays in project development, including construction delays, and ultimate failure of the project.  Our co-investors also may not be able to provide capital to the applicable entity on the terms agreed to or at all, and the applicable entity may be unable to obtain external financing to finance their operations.  Also, our ability to exit the equity investments may be subject to contractual and other limitations.With any third-party arrangement, there is a risk that our partners’ economic, business, or legal interests or objectives may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements and/or failure of the applicable project or initiative.  We are also subject to risks relating to our co-investors’ failure to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners and changes in the ownership of any of our co-investors.Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionOur TwinSpires and Gaming segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  It may be difficult to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.  The concentration and evolution of the slot machine and HRM manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usA significant amount of our revenue is attributable to slot, HRM, VLTs, and video poker machines operated by us at our properties, and there are a limited number of slot machine and HRM manufacturers servicing the industry.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector.  Recently, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation and slot machine manufacturers have occasionally refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental.  Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win.  Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.  If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.We rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations.  Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk. Our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks, and the failure to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties.  If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted.  For example, the Interstate Horseracing Act, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing.  Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the ""Horsemen’s Groups"").  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the 18racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, the Horsemen's Groups on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third-party races could have a material adverse impact on our business, as such failure will result in our inability to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting. From time to time, certain Horsemen’s Groups have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We also have written agreements with certain Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in certain states that may be required to operate such gaming.  We have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities, OTBs, and ADWs.  From time to time, we may be unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We intend to focus on market access and our retail operations for our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will generate sufficient returns on our investmentDuring the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting.  Thirty-three states have authorized sports betting and thirty of these states have sports betting operational as of December 31, 2022.  Additional states may legalize sports betting in the future.  Each state has different structures for the number of allowable industry participants, license fees, taxes, and other operational requirements.  The market for sports betting and online gaming is rapidly evolving and highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors.  The success of our retail and online sportsbook and online casino operations are dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including:•the timing of adoption of regulations authorizing betting and gaming activities, •operating requirements and other restrictions,•the number of allowable industry participants,•the license fees and tax rates,•our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market,•the potential that the market does not develop as we anticipate,•our ability to compete with new entrants in the market,•changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, and•the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment.There can be no assurance as to the returns that we will receive from TwinSpires Sports and Casino business.Operational RisksOur business is subject to online security risk, including cyber-security breaches.  Loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers’ personal information, could lead to government enforcement actions or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our businessWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer and employee data by maintaining and transmitting customers’ personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information.  Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, and such privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve.  Many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement.  California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA""), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, providing California consumers greater control of the information 19collected, stored, and sold, and other states are considering similar legislation.  The CCPA provides a private right of action (in addition to statutory damages) for California residents whose sensitive personal information was breached as a result of a business’s violation of its duty to reasonably secure such information.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law.  Any failure on our part to comply with these laws or our privacy policies may subject us to significant liabilities, including governmental enforcement actions or litigation. Our systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, may not be successful.  Interruptions in our services or a breach of a customer’s secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, which could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions could also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our casinos.  Such incidents could give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines, and other penalties, which could be significant.  We attempt to protect against this risk with our property and business interruption insurance, which covers damage or interruption of our systems, although there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential losses.Third parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our privacy policies, and such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business.  We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association’s contracts with payment card processors.  Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks.  Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant.  Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers.  As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations.  We have insurance coverage for protection against cyber-attacks, which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations, and legal advice.  This insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.Our operations rely heavily on technology services, and catastrophic events and system failures with respect to these technology services could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsWe rely on information technology and other systems to manage our business.  A disruption or failure in our technology systems or operations in the event of a cyber-attack, major earthquake, weather event, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of our or our customers’ information, litigation, and potential liability.  In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of our technology systems could impact our operations.  A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, subject us to litigation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Our online wagering, HRM and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to attempt to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage.  Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated 20problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our websites and our services could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  We may not be able to identify and / or complete acquisitions, divestitures, development of new venues or the expansion of existing facilities on time, on budget or as plannedWe pursue acquisitions, divestitures, development of new venues and expansion of existing facilities to grow our business. We face challenges in identifying and completing acquisitions or divestiture opportunities or other development or expansion projects that fit with our strategic objectives.  These projects require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt.  These projects also have risks associated with managing and integrating the acquisition or expansion project.Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure related to these projects could lead to delays and higher project costs.  The acquisition or divestiture of businesses may be delayed by external factors beyond our control including federal, state, and local issues.  The impact of these risks may cause us not to realize the intended benefits of these capital investments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include the following: •restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions,•non-recurring transaction costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities, and•costs of imposing financial and management controls and operating, administrative and information systems.We perform financial, operational, and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate these businesses successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth,•the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition,•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products,•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third-party insurers,•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy,•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience,•the potential loss of key employees or customers,•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit employees with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses, and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.21The development of new venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos, other gaming venues, or racetracks in response to opportunities that may arise.  For example, we've announced multiple major multi-year capital investments to transform key areas of  Churchill Downs Racetrack, as well as other capital investments such as the build out of Derby City Gaming Downtown, Rosie's Emporia and Dumfries, the Ellis Park Owensboro Annex, a charitable gaming facility in New Hampshire and the Terre Haute Casino Resort.  Future development projects may require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  In addition, we may not receive the intended benefits of such capital investments. Ownership and development of our real estate requires significant expenditures and ownership of such properties is subject to risk, including risks related to environmental liabilities We own extensive real estate holdings and make significant capital investments to grow our operations.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  Significant expenditures, including property taxes, debt repayments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property.  Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  Some of our facilities are subject to CAFO regulations.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.  Enforcement of such regulations have been receiving increased governmental attention and compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures (including with respect to fines).Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport, and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationPersonal injuries and injuries to horses have occurred during races or workouts, and may continue to occur, which could subject us to negative publicity and / or litigation.  Negative publicity may lead some customers to avoid the Company’s properties or could cause horse owners to avoid racing their horses at our racetracks.  Any litigation resulting from injuries at our properties could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.  We buy insurance for all of our racetracks; however, our coverage may not be sufficient for all losses.  Due to the potential impact of negative publicity and inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties.  It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives, or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.  If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customers22We allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (""EFT"") and credit and debit cards.  As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements.  We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options.  For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability.  We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.  We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.  If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions.  Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided.  In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks.  Our control procedures to protect from chargebacks may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans and limit our operational flexibilitySome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We may experience additional union activity in the future.  Any such union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our business and result in significant costs.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe face risks related to pending or future legal proceedings and other actions  From time to time, we are a party in various lawsuits and judicial and governmental actions.  No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these lawsuits and actions which can be expensive and time consuming.  We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits or actions, which could result in settlements, costs or damages that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.  Such matters may include investigations or litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees relating to intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We have also been subject to claims in cases concerning or similar to class action allegations.  Plaintiffs in such lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated.  We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the potential losses we may incur.  In many cases, including class action matters, we may not be able to estimate the potential losses we will incur and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient.  These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ.  Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings.  We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.Our operations are highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessWe conduct live and historical pari-mutuel wagering, online pari-mutuel wagering through ADWs, casino gaming, online gaming, and sports betting operations, which are subject to extensive state and for some local regulation.  These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct our operations or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in the Company.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing governmental licenses, registrations, permits or approvals necessary to operate our existing businesses or demonstrate suitability to obtain any licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals.  The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  As we expand our operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from authorities in these jurisdictions.  The approval process can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful.  23Our Live and Historical Racing segment is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized pari-mutuel wagering in states where we operate.  Our wagering and racing (including HRM) facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities.  We have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for operation.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to obtain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct or our racing (including HRM) operation.  The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of HRMs.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating pari-mutuel laws or regulations.  For example, individual plaintiffs associated with video poker and truck stops in Louisiana are challenging the constitutionality of the Louisiana 2021 HHR Act which may adversely impact Fair Ground’s historical racing operations.   TwinSpires accepts ADW wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund accounts from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet pursuant to the Interstate Horseracing Act and relevant licenses and consents.  The online horse racing wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing ADW pari-mutuel wagering vary from state to state.  State attorney generals, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state laws, federal laws, constitutional principles, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.   States may take affirmative action to make ADW expressly unlawful.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our online horse racing wagering business or in any legal challenge to the validity of any restrictions on ADW.  Legal challenges and regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.     Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states or increase competition for online wagering.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Financial RisksOur debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares,•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments,•make certain investments,•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets,•create liens on certain assets,•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates, and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.Any failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants in our debt facilities and other indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us,24•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit, or•could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted themIncreases to interest rates (due to inflation or otherwise), disruptions in the credit markets, or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.While we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, interest rate increases, disruption in the credit markets, changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. During inflationary periods, interest rates have historically increased, which would have a direct effect on the interest expense of our borrowings.  In particular, primarily in response to concerns about inflation, the U.S. Federal Reserve has significantly raised its benchmark federal funds rate, which has led to increases in interest rates in the credit markets.  The U.S. Federal Reserve may continue to raise the federal funds rate, which will likely lead to higher interest rates in the credit markets and the possibility of lower asset values, slowing economic growth and/or possibly leading to a recession.  We are exposed to increases in interest rates on our variable-rate borrowings, which consist of borrowings under our credit facility and our term loans. Therefore, interest rate increases, due to inflation or otherwise, could, increase our interest expense under these variable-rate facilities in the short-term and increase our financing costs as we refinance our existing variable-rate and fixed-rate long-term borrowings in the long term, or we could incur additional interest expense related to the issuance of incremental debt.  These increased costs could reduce our profitability, impair our ability to meet our debt obligations,  negatively impact our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants in our Credit Agreement, or increase the cost of financing our acquisition, investment, and development activity.Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital.Our insurance costs may increase, we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future, and the extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our operating properties in the event of inclement weather and casualty events, all could adversely affect our businessWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain additional exclusions from our coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, we could be at risk for increased potential losses, which could be substantial.  Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these requirements, an event of default could result under these debt instruments or material agreements. Portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.  After carefully weighing the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks, as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage, we may opt to retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.  Retained risks are associated with deductible limits or self-insured retentions, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.Flooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other weather conditions could adversely affect our casino and horse racing locations.  We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, which coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of weather conditions in the future, or if weather conditions adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.We have ""all risk"" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism).  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits and certain exclusions, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.  Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our obligations.25"
11,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2022-02-23,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Economic and External RisksThe current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results. Other major public health issues could adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results in the futureIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic.  Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the continued effects of the COVID-19 virus, including the emergence of variant strains, and the extent of and effectiveness of responses taken on international, national and local levels.  The long-term impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and world economies and continued impact on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted.The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by national, state, and local authorities in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks. The introduction of vaccine and facemask mandates in certain locations may further impact the number of customers visiting our properties. During the course of the pandemic, we experienced temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly-owned gaming properties, certain wholly-owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments.  Although all of our properties are now open to customers, certain locations continue to operate with certain restrictions and limitations on amenities, and the continued impact of the pandemic could result in further suspension of operations. The Company continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the Company's operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company's control, including the timing, extent, trajectory, and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution, and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy.  Our business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, public health threats, civil unrest, and inclement weather, including as a result of climate changeOur operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks, which is subject to the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events that may discourage attendance or expose us to substantial liability. Terrorist activity, including acts of domestic terrorism, civil unrest or other actions that discourage attendance at other locations, or even the threat of such activity, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions, safety and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, could result in reduced attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and at our other locations. A major epidemic or pandemic, outbreak of a contagious equine disease, or the threat of such an event, could also adversely affect attendance and could impact the supply chain for our major construction projects resulting in higher costs and delays of the projects. The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in the temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly-owned gaming properties, certain wholly-owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments.  While we are constantly evaluating our security precautions in an effort to ensure the safety of the public, no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances of avoiding potential liabilities. Since horse racing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends.  Extreme weather events that are linked to rising temperatures, changing global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperatures, as well as sea levels, rain and snow could result in increased occurrence and severity of adverse weather events.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  The occurrence or threat of any such extraordinary event at our locations, particularly at Churchill Downs Racetrack and Kentucky Derby and Oaks week, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.Our business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers’ discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations Economic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers’ discretionary spending, including:•Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers’ disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.  •Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  16•Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, our online wagering sites and gaming and wagering facilities, and reduced consumer spending overall.Our access to and the cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends.  Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the horse racing, online wagering and casino industries.  Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions.  It is not possible to determine the likelihood, extent or impact of any future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. Strategic RisksA lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses or any deterioration in our reputation could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersHorse racing, pari-mutuel wagering and casino gaming businesses depend on the public perception of integrity and fairness in their operations.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A lack or loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business. Acts of fraud or cheating in our gaming businesses through the use of counterfeit chips, covert schemes and other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees, may be attempted or committed by our gaming customers with the aim of increasing their winnings. Our gaming customers, visitors and employees may also commit crimes such as theft in order to obtain chips not belonging to them. We have taken measures to safeguard our interests including the implementation of systems, processes and technologies to mitigate against these risks, extensive employee training, surveillance, security and investigation operations and adoption of appropriate security features on our chips such as embedded radio frequency identification tags. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or detecting such culpable behavior and schemes in a timely manner and the relevant insurance we have obtained may not be sufficient to cover our losses depending on the incident, which could result in losses to our gaming operations and generate negative publicity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows.Other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us, our properties, or our industries, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.An inability to attract and retain key and highly-qualified and skilled personnel, as well as disruptions in the general labor market, could impact our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly-qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization.  If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business could be impacted. Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate.  As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled employees.  We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth. 17Certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impact our operations.  We have observed an increasingly competitive labor market. Increased employee turnover, changes in the availability of our workers, or labor shortages in our supply chain could result in increased costs and impact our ability to fully staff our operations, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Our Company faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseWe face an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants operating from physical locations and/or through online or mobile platforms, including destination casinos, riverboat casinos; dockside casinos; land-based casinos; video lottery; iGaming; sports betting; gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois; gaming at truck stop establishments in certain states, such as Louisiana and Pennsylvania; historical horse racing in Kentucky; sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos; fantasy sports; Native American gaming; and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, illegal slot machines and skill games, fantasy sports and internet or mobile-based gaming platforms, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and/or play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker, sports betting and other varieties of iGaming in a number of states. Expansion of land-based and iGaming in other jurisdictions (both regulated and unregulated) could further compete with our traditional and iGaming operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have properties, have recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming. Established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional tax revenue sources of state governments by authorizing or expanding gaming in the states that we operate in or the states that are adjacent to or near our existing properties. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons could increase competition for our operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.Our operations also face competition from other leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel.Our Churchill Downs Racetrack and the Kentucky Derby may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, attendance, wagering, and sponsorships  Our Churchill Downs Racetrack is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races.  If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Live and Historical Racing segment. In addition, accidents and adverse events that may occur at our race track and any reputational damage as a result may negatively impact attendance at our live horse races. If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The number and level of sponsorships are important to the success of the Kentucky Derby.  Our ability to retain sponsors, acquire new sponsors, and compete for sponsorships and advertising dollars could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We are subject to significant risks associated with our equity investments, strategic alliances and other third-party agreementsWe pursue certain license opportunities, development projects and other strategic business opportunities through equity investments, joint ventures, license arrangements and other alliances with third-parties.  Our equity investments are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our co-investors and therefore, we do not unilaterally control the applicable entity or other initiatives. The terms of the equity investments and the rights of our co-investors may preclude us from taking actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company. Disagreements with our co-investors could result in delays in project development, including construction delays, and ultimate failure of the project.  Our co-investors also may not be able to provide capital to the applicable entity on the terms agreed to or at all, and the applicable entity may be unable to obtain external financing to finance their operations. Also, our ability to exit the equity investments may be subject to contractual and other limitations.With any third-party arrangement, there is a risk that our partners’ economic, business or legal interests or objectives may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements and/or failure of the applicable project or initiative.  We are also 18subject to risks relating to our co-investors’ failure to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners and changes in the ownership of any of our co-investors.Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionOur TwinSpires and Gaming segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  It may be difficult to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.  The concentration and evolution of the slot machine and HRM manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usA significant amount of our revenue is attributable to slot, HRM, VLTs, and video poker machines operated by us at our properties, and there are a limited number of slot machine and HRM manufacturers servicing the industry.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector.  Recently, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation and slot machine manufacturers have occasionally refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental.  Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.  If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.We rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations.  Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk. Our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks, and the failure to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties.  If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted.  For example, the Interstate Horseracing Act, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing.  Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the ""Horsemen’s Groups"").  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, the Horsemen's Groups on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third-parties’ races could have a material adverse impact on our business, as such failure will result in our inability to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting. From time to time, certain Horsemen’s Groups have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We also have written agreements with certain Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in certain states that may be required to operate such gaming.  We have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities, OTBs, and ADWs.  From time to time, we may be unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The 19inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We intend to focus on market access and our retail operations for our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will generate sufficient returns on our investmentDuring the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting. As a result, several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future. The market for sports betting and online gaming is rapidly evolving and highly competitive with an increasing number of competitors. The success of our retail and online sportsbook and online casino operations are dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control, including:•the timing of adoption of regulations authorizing betting and gaming activities, •operating requirements and other restrictions,•the number of allowable industry participants,•the license fees and tax rates,•our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market,•the potential that the market does not develop as we anticipate,•our ability to compete with new entrants in the market,•changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, and•the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment.There can be no assurance as to the returns that we will receive from our current and anticipated retail and online sports betting and online casino operations.Operational RisksOur business is subject to online security risk, including cyber-security breaches.  Loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers’ personal information, could lead to government enforcement actions or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our businessWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer and employee data by maintaining and transmitting customers’ personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information.  Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, and such privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve.  Many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement.  California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA""), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, providing California consumers greater control of the information collected, stored, and sold, and other states are considering similar legislation.  The CCPA provides a private right of action (in addition to statutory damages) for California residents whose sensitive personal information was breached as a result of a business’s violation of its duty to reasonably secure such information.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law.  Any failure on our part to comply with these laws or our privacy policies may subject us to significant liabilities, including governmental enforcement actions or litigation. Our systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, may not be successful. Interruptions in our services or a breach of a customer’s secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, which could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions could also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our casinos.  Such incidents could give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.  We attempt to protect against this risk with our property and business interruption insurance, which covers damage or interruption of our systems, although there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential losses.Third-parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our privacy policies, and such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business.  We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association’s contracts with payment card processors.  Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and 20penalties.  If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks.  Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. We have insurance coverage for protection against cyber-attacks, which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations, and legal advice.  This insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.Our operations rely heavily on technology services, and catastrophic events and system failures with respect to these technology services could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsWe rely on information technology and other systems to manage our business.  A disruption or failure in our technology systems or operations in the event of a cyber-attack, major earthquake, weather event, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of our or our customers’ information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our technology systems could impact our operations. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, subject us to litigation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Our online wagering, HRM and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to attempt to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage.  Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our websites and our services could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  We may not be able to identify and / or complete acquisitions, divestitures, development of new venues or the expansion of existing facilities on time, on budget or as plannedWe pursue acquisitions, divestitures, development of new venues and expansion of existing facilities to grow our business. We face challenges in identifying and completing acquisitions or divestiture opportunities or other development or expansion projects that fit with our strategic objectives. These projects require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt. These projects also have risks associated with managing and integrating the acquisition or expansion project.We signed a definitive agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Peninsula Pacific Entertainment LLC (""P2E"") for total consideration of $2.485 billion.  Important factors for the proposed P2E transaction include the receipt of regulatory approvals on terms desired or anticipated, unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the proposed transaction, including, without limitation, difficulties that result in the failure to realize expected synergies, efficiencies and cost savings from the proposed transaction within the expected time period (if at all), our ability to obtain financing on the anticipated terms and schedule, disruptions of our or P2E’s current plans, operations and relationships with customers and suppliers caused by the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, and our and P2E’s ability to consummate a sale-leaseback transaction with respect to the Hard Rock Sioux City on terms desired or anticipated.21Supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressure related to these projects could lead to delays and higher project costs. The acquisition or divestiture of businesses may be delayed by external factors beyond our control including federal, state, and local issues.  The impact of these risks may cause us to realize the intended benefits of these capital investments which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include the following: •restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions,•non-recurring transaction costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities, and•costs of imposing financial and management controls and operating, administrative and information systems.We perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate these businesses successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth,•the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition,•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products,•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third-party insurers,•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy,•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience,•the potential loss of key employees or customers,•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit employees with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses, and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The development of new venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos, other gaming venues, or racetracks in response to opportunities that may arise.  For example, in July 2021, we announced three major multi-year capital investments to transform key areas of  Churchill Downs Racetrack: the Homestretch Club, the Turn 1 Experience, and the Paddock and Under the Spires projects. Future development projects may require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt, which could 22have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition, we may not receive the intended benefits of such capital investments. Ownership and development of our real estate requires significant expenditures and ownership of such properties is subject to risk, including risks related to environmental liabilities We own extensive real estate holdings and make significant capital investments to grow our operations.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  Significant expenditures, including property taxes, debt repayments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property.  Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  Some of our facilities are subject to CAFO regulations.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.  Enforcement of such regulations have been receiving increased governmental attention and compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures (including with respect to fines).Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationPersonal injuries and injuries to horses have occurred during races or workouts, and may continue to occur, which could subject us to negative publicity and / or litigation.  Negative publicity may lead some customers to avoid the Company’s properties or could cause horse owners to avoid racing their horses at our racetracks.  Any litigation resulting from injuries at our properties could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.  We buy insurance for all of our racetracks; however, our coverage may not be sufficient for all losses.  Due to the potential impact of negative publicity and inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customersWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (""EFT"") and credit and debit cards.  As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements.  We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability.  We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.  We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.  If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 23Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions.  Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided.  In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks.  Our control procedures to protect from chargebacks may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans and limit our operational flexibilitySome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We may experience additional union activity in the future.  Any such union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our business and result in significant costs.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe face risks related to pending or future legal proceedings and other actions  From time to time, we are a party in various lawsuits and judicial and governmental actions.  No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these lawsuits and actions which can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits or actions, which could result in settlements, costs or damages that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. Such matters may include investigations or litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees relating to intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We have also been subject to claims in cases concerning or similar to class action allegations.  Plaintiffs in such lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the potential losses we may incur. In many cases, including class action matters, we may not be able to estimate the potential losses we will incur and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient.  These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings.  We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.Our operations are highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessWe conduct live and historical pari-mutuel wagering, online pari-mutuel wagering through ADWs, casino gaming, online gaming, and sports betting operations, which are subject to extensive state and for some local regulation. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct our operations or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in the Company.  Regulatory authorities have input into our operations, such as hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of machines. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets, the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing governmental licenses, registrations, permits or approvals necessary to operate our existing businesses or demonstrate suitability to obtain any licenses, registrations, permits, or approvals. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. As we expand our operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful.  Our Live and Historical Racing segment is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized pari-mutuel wagering in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing (including HRM) facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities.  We have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for operation.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to obtain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct or our racing (including HRM) operation. The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of HRMs.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating pari-mutuel laws or regulations.   24TwinSpires accepts ADWs from customers of certain states who set up and fund accounts from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet pursuant to the Interstate Horseracing Act and relevant licenses and consents.  The online horse racing wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing ADW pari-mutuel wagering vary from state to state. State attorney generals, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state laws, federal laws, constitutional principles, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.   States may take affirmative action to make ADW expressly unlawful.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our online horse racing wagering business or in any legal challenge to the validity of any restrictions on ADW.  Legal challenges and regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.     Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states or increase competition for online wagering.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Financial RisksOur debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares,•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments,•make certain investments,•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets,•create liens on certain assets,•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates, and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.Any failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants in our debt facilities and other indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us,•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit, or•could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.Disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.While we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets, interest rate increases, changes that may result from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or changes to our credit 25ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. Our insurance costs may increase, we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future, and the extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our operating properties in the event of inclement weather and casualty events, all could adversely affect our businessWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain additional exclusions from our coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, we could be at risk for increased potential losses, which could be substantial.  Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these requirements, an event of default could result under these debt instruments or material agreements. Portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.  After carefully weighing the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks, as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage, we may opt to retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.  Retained risks are associated with deductible limits or self-insured retentions, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.Flooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other weather conditions could adversely affect our casino and horse racing locations.  We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, which coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of weather conditions in the future, or if weather conditions adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.We have ""all risk"" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism).  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits and certain exclusions, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.  Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our obligations"
8,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2021-02-24,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Economic and External RisksThe current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results.  Other major public health issues could adversely affect our business, financial condition and financial results in the futureIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic.  Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the potential effects of the COVID-19 virus, and the extent of and effectiveness of responses taken on international, national and local levels.  Measures taken to limit the impact of COVID-19, including shelter-in-place orders, social distancing measures, travel bans and restrictions, and business and government shutdowns, have resulted and some continue to result in significant negative economic impacts in the U.S. and in relation to our business.  The long-term impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and world economies and continued impact on our business remains uncertain, the duration and scope of which cannot currently be predicted.Our operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks.  In March 2020, we announced the temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly-owned gaming properties, certain wholly-owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments.  Starting in mid-February, U.S. and international sporting events were cancelled, which reduced our sports betting options for our customers.  Horse racing content for wagering on TwinSpires also decreased, although handle increased as our customers wagered more on the content that was available.  Although vaccines are now available, distribution is currently limited and there can be no assurance that these vaccines will be successful in ending the COVID-19 global pandemic.In May 2020, we began to reopen our properties with patron restrictions and gaming limitations.  One property temporarily suspended operations again in July 2020 after reopening and reopened in August 2020, and three properties suspended operations in December 2020 and reopened in January 2021.  We implemented a number of  initiatives to facilitate social distancing and enhanced cleaning, such as increased frequency of cleaning and sanitizing of all high-touch surfaces, mandatory temperature checks of all guests and team members upon entry and required training for all team members on safety protocols.  Certain amenities at our properties continue to be suspended, including food buffets and valet services, and certain restaurants and food outlets.  We cannot predict how soon our casino and racetrack properties will be able to return to customary operations.  Our ability to return to our customary operations will depend, in part, on the actions of a number of governmental bodies over which we have no control.  Once all restrictions are lifted, it is unclear how quickly customers will return to our casinos and racetracks, which may be a function of continued concerns over safety and decreased consumer spending due to economic conditions, including job losses.Certain non-furloughed employees continue to work remotely.  An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain business continuity plans, introduce operational risk (including but not limited to cybersecurity risks) and may impair our ability to manage our business.  We also outsource certain business activities to third parties.  As a result, we rely upon the successful implementation and execution of the business continuity planning of such entities in the current environment.  While we seek to monitor the business continuity activities of these third parties, successful implementation and execution of their business continuity strategies are largely outside our control.  If one or more of the third parties to whom we outsource certain business activities experience operational failures or business disruption as a result of the impacts from the spread of COVID-19, or claim that they cannot perform, it may have negative effects on our business and financial condition.The Company reduced planned maintenance and project capital expenditures for 2020 as a result of the temporary property and operations closures and prioritized capital investments based on the highest near-term return opportunities in order to maintain financial flexibility.We are currently following the recommendations of local and federal health authorities to minimize exposure risk for our various stakeholders, including employees.  The full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions required to contain COVID-19, the duration and spread of COVID-19 within the markets in which we operate, the availability of, use of and effectiveness of vaccines, mandates and directives from federal, state and local authorities, the effect of COVID-19 on consumer confidence and spending and our ability to maintain a sufficient workforce.  If we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if state and local authorities or customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future.  18Our business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, public health threats, civil unrest, and inclement weatherOur operating results depend, in large part, on revenues derived from customers visiting our casinos and racetracks, which is subject to the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events that may discourage attendance or expose us to substantial liability. Terrorist activity, including acts of domestic terrorism, or other actions that discourage attendance at other locations, or even the threat of such activity, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions, safety and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, could result in reduced attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and at our other locations. A major epidemic or pandemic, outbreak of a contagious equine disease, or the threat of such an event, could also adversely affect attendance and could impact the supply chain for our major construction projects resulting in higher costs and delays of the projects. The COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in the temporary suspension of operations of all of our wholly-owned gaming properties, certain wholly-owned racing operations, and the two casino properties related to our equity investments.  Even though our properties have reopened, such properties continue to be subject to operational restrictions that may impact attendance. Riots, civil insurrection or social unrest could adversely affect attendance.  For example, during the second and third quarters of 2020, certain areas of Louisville, Kentucky, experienced sustained protests and civil unrest.  Similar events in the future could adversely affect attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack.  While we are constantly evaluating our security precautions in an effort to ensure the safety of the public, no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances of avoiding potential liabilities. Since horse racing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends.  Extreme weather events that are linked to rising temperatures, changing global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperatures, as well as sea levels, rain and snow could result in increased occurrence and severity of adverse weather events.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  The occurrence or threat of any such extraordinary event at our locations, particularly at Churchill Downs Racetrack and Kentucky Derby and Oaks week, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.Our business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers’ discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations Economic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers’ discretionary spending, including:•Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers’ disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.  •Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  •Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, our online wagering sites and gaming and wagering facilities, and reduced consumer spending overall.Our access to and the cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends.  Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the horse racing, online wagering and casino industries.  Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions.  It is not possible to determine the likelihood, extent or impact of any future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. 19Strategic RisksOur Company faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseWe face an increasingly high degree of competition among a large number of participants operating from physical locations and/or through online or mobile platforms, including destination casinos, riverboat casinos; dockside casinos; land-based casinos; video lottery; iGaming; sports betting; gaming at taverns in certain states, such as Illinois; gaming at truck stop establishments in certain states, such as Louisiana and Pennsylvania; historical horse racing in Kentucky; sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos; fantasy sports; Native American gaming; and other forms of gaming in the U.S. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, illegal slot machines and skill games, fantasy sports and internet or mobile-based gaming platforms, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and/or play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Currently, there are proposals that would legalize internet poker, sports betting and other varieties of iGaming in a number of states. Expansion of land-based and iGaming in other jurisdictions (both regulated and unregulated) could further compete with our traditional and iGaming operations, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operations also face competition from other leisure and entertainment activities, including shopping, athletic events, television and movies, concerts and travel. Legalized gaming is currently permitted in various forms throughout the U.S. and on various lands taken into trust for the benefit of certain Native Americans in the U.S. and Canada. Other jurisdictions, including states adjacent to states in which we currently have properties, have recently legalized, implemented and expanded gaming. Established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion or relocation of existing gaming operations. Voters and state legislatures may seek to supplement traditional tax revenue sources of state governments by authorizing or expanding gaming in the states that we operate in or the states that are adjacent to or near our existing properties. New, relocated or expanded operations by other persons could increase competition for our operations and could have a material adverse impact on us.Our Churchill Downs Racetrack and the Kentucky Derby may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, attendance, wagering, and sponsorships  Our Churchill Downs Racetrack is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined on average 4.6% per year from 2008 to 2014 due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives.  From 2015 to 2018, pari-mutuel handle on horse racing has been relatively stable with average annual growth of 1.7%.   In 2019 and 2020, pari-mutuel handle decreased on average 1.5% per year due to horse race cancellations from safety concerns in California in 2019 and due to the COVID-19 global pandemic in 2020.  If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Churchill Downs segment.  If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The number and level of sponsorships are important to the success of the Kentucky Derby.  Our ability to retain sponsors, acquire new sponsors, and compete for sponsorships and advertising dollars could have a material adverse impact on our business.  An inability to attract and retain key and highly-qualified and skilled personnel could impact our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly-qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization.  If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business could be impacted. Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate.  As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled employees.  We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth. Certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impact our operations.  20A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses or any deterioration in our reputation could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersHorse racing, pari-mutuel wagering and casino gaming businesses depend on the public perception of integrity and fairness in their operations.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A lack or loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business. Acts of fraud or cheating in our gaming businesses through the use of counterfeit chips, covert schemes and other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees, may be attempted or committed by our gaming customers with the aim of increasing their winnings. Our gaming customers, visitors and employees may also commit crimes such as theft in order to obtain chips not belonging to them. We have taken measures to safeguard our interests including the implementation of systems, processes and technologies to mitigate against these risks, extensive employee training, surveillance, security and investigation operations and adoption of appropriate security features on our chips such as embedded radio frequency identification tags. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or detecting such culpable behavior and schemes in a timely manner and the relevant insurance we have obtained may not be sufficient to cover our losses depending on the incident, which could result in losses to our gaming operations and generate negative publicity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows.Other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us, our properties, or our industries, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.We are subject to significant risks associated with our equity investments, strategic alliances and other third-party agreementsWe pursue certain license opportunities, development projects and other strategic business opportunities through equity investments, joint ventures, license arrangements and other alliances with third-parties.  Our equity investments are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our co-investors and therefore, we do not unilaterally control the applicable entity or other initiatives. The terms of the equity investments and the rights of our co-investors may preclude us from taking actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company. Disagreements with our co-investors could result in delays in project development, including construction delays, and ultimate failure of the project.  Our co-investors also may not be able to provide capital to the applicable entity on the terms agreed to or at all, and the applicable entity may be unable to obtain external financing to finance their operations. Also, our ability to exit the equity investments may be subject to contractual and other limitations.With any third-party arrangement, there is a risk that our partners’ economic, business or legal interests or objectives may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements and/or failure of the applicable project or initiative.  We are also subject to risks relating to our co-investors’ failure to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners and changes in the ownership of any of our co-investors.Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionOur Online Wagering and Gaming segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  It may be difficult to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.  21The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenue is attributable to slot, VLTs, and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities, and there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the U.S. in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector.  Recently, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation and slot machine manufacturers have occasionally refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental.  Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.  If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.We rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations.  Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk. Our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks, and the failure to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties.  If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted.  For example, the Interstate Horseracing Act, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing.  Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the ""Horsemen’s Groups"").  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, the Horsemen's Groups on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third-parties’ races could have a material adverse impact on our business, as such failure will result in our inability to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting. From time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc., which represents horsemen in Florida, and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also have written agreements with certain Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in certain states that may be required to operate such gaming.  We have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities, OTBs, and ADWs.  From time to time, we may be unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.22We intend to expand our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, that our expansion initiatives will be successful, or that we will generate sufficient returns on our investmentDuring the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting.  As a result, several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and / or iGaming and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future.  The success of our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business is dependent on potential legislation in various jurisdictions that affect the sports betting and iGaming industries in the U.S.  We continue to engage with state lawmakers in our other jurisdictions to advocate for the passage of sports betting and iGaming laws with reasonable tax rates and license fees.  There can be no assurances when, or if, regulations enabling sports betting and online casino gaming and poker will be adopted, or the terms of such regulations, in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.States or the federal government may legalize online sports betting and iGaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us.  If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online sports betting and iGaming subject to a brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online sports betting and iGaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction on acceptable terms. In order to compete successfully, we may need to enter into agreements with strategic partners and other third-party vendors and we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us.  If we are unable to obtain, or are otherwise delayed in obtaining, the necessary licenses to operate our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business in U.S. jurisdictions where online sports betting and iGaming are legalized, our ability to grow our business could be materially impacted. Our ability to compete may also be impacted by our failure to obtain approval in the applicable jurisdiction of our technology and service providers in a timely manner and by our failure to efficiently implement and market our TwinSpires Sports and iGaming platform in a state that legalizes online sports betting and / or iGaming.  Such failures could impair our business growth in these jurisdictions, which could have a material impact on our business.Our TwinSpires Sports and Casino business competes in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors.  The success of our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on a number of factors including the potential that the market does not develop as we anticipate, our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market, the competitive landscape and our ability to compete with new entrants in the market, our ability to implement effective, efficient, and compliant procedures and processes in each jurisdiction, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, the performance of and licensing of third- party vendors, and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. Operational RisksWe may not be able to identify and complete expansion, acquisition or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations. We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating such acquisition or development projects.  As described in further detail below, new developments or acquisitions may not be completed or integrated successfully.  The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers.  Current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues.  New properties or developments may not be completed or integrated successfully. We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include the following: •restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions,•non-recurring transaction costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities, and23•costs of imposing financial and management controls and operating, administrative and information systems.We perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth,•the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition,•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products,•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third-party insurers,•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy,•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience,•the potential loss of key employees or customers,•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses, and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The development of new venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos, other gaming venues, or racetracks in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects may require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Ownership and development of our real estate requires significant expenditures and ownership of such properties is subject to risk, including risks related to environmental liabilities We own extensive real estate holdings and make significant capital investments to grow our operations.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  Significant expenditures, including property taxes, debt repayments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property.  Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  Some of our facilities are subject to CAFO regulations.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.  We recently incurred such a penalty in connection with alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds Race Course, as further discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings.  Enforcement of such regulations have been receiving increased governmental attention and compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures (including with respect to fines).Our operations rely heavily on technology services, and catastrophic events and system failures with respect to these technology services could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsWe rely on information technology and other systems to manage our business.  A disruption or failure in our technology systems or operations in the event of a cyber-attack, major earthquake, weather event, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of our or our customers’ information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our technology systems could impact our operations. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, 24security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, subject us to litigation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Our online wagering, HRM and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to attempt to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage.  Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our websites and our services could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  Our business is subject to online security risk, including cyber-security breaches.  Loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers’ personal information, could lead to government enforcement actions or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our businessWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer and employee data by maintaining and transmitting customers’ personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information.  Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, and such privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve.  Many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement.  California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA""), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, providing California consumers greater control of the information collected, stored, and sold, and other states are considering similar legislation.  The CCPA provides a private right of action (in addition to statutory damages) for California residents whose sensitive personal information was breached as a result of a business’s violation of its duty to reasonably secure such information.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law.  Any failure on our part to comply with these laws or our privacy policies may subject us to significant liabilities, including governmental enforcement actions or litigation. Our systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, may not be successful. Interruptions in our services or a breach of a customer’s secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, which could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions could also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our casinos.  Such incidents could give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.  We attempt to protect against this risk with our property and business interruption insurance, which covers damage or interruption of our systems, although there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential losses.Third-parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our privacy policies, and such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business.  We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association’s contracts with payment card processors.  Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks.  Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it 25necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. We have insurance coverage for protection against cyber-attacks, which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations, and legal advice.  This insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationPersonal injuries and injuries to horses have occurred during races or workouts, and may continue to occur, which could subject us to negative publicity and / or litigation.  Negative publicity may lead some customers to avoid the Company’s properties or could cause horse owners to avoid racing their horses at our racetracks.  Any litigation resulting from injuries at our properties could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.  We buy insurance for all of our racetracks; however, our coverage may not be sufficient for all losses.  Due to the potential impact of negative publicity and inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S., including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customersWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (""EFT"") and credit and debit cards.  As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements.  We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability.  We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.  We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.  If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions.  Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided.  In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks.  Our control procedures to protect from chargebacks may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations. Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans and limit our operational flexibilitySome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We may experience additional union activity in the future.  Any such union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our business and result in significant costs.26Legal and Regulatory RisksWe face risks related to pending or future legal proceedings and other actions  From time to time, we are a party in various lawsuits and judicial and governmental actions.  No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these lawsuits and actions which can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits or actions, which could result in settlements, costs or damages that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. Such matters may include investigations or litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees relating to intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Judicial actions involving third parties may also indirectly impact our business. For example, as described further in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, on September 24, 2020, the Kentucky Supreme Court issued an opinion reversing a prior ruling of the Franklin Circuit Court with respect to the legality of certain Encore/Exacta historical racing machines in operation in Kentucky as of the January 2018 trial date, and holding that wagers placed through such machines are not pari-mutuel and are therefore prohibited under Kentucky law.  Although we do not use the Encore/Exacta system in any of our historical racing machine facilities, this opinion, depending on how it is interpreted and enforced or addressed by the legislature may impact our historical racing machine facilities in Kentucky. We have also been subject to claims in cases concerning or similar to class action allegations.  Plaintiffs in such lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the potential losses we may incur. In many cases, including class action matters, we may not be able to estimate the potential losses we will incur and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient.  These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings.  We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.Our operations are highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessWe conduct live and historical pari-mutuel wagering, online pari-mutuel wagering through ADWs, casino gaming, online gaming, and sports betting operations, which are subject to extensive state and for some local regulation. These regulatory authorities have broad discretion, and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct our operations or prevent another person from owning an equity interest in the Company.  Regulatory authorities have input into our operations, such as hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of machines. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets, the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We have demonstrated suitability to obtain and have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for us to operate our existing businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain those existing licenses or demonstrate suitability to obtain any new licenses, registrations, permits or approvals. In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction. As we expand our operations in our existing jurisdictions or to new areas, we may have to meet additional suitability requirements and obtain additional licenses, registrations, permits and approvals from authorities in these jurisdictions. The approval process can be time-consuming and costly, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful.  Our Churchill Downs segment is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized pari-mutuel wagering in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing (including HRM) facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities.  To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for operation.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to obtain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct or our racing (including HRM) operations, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.  In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of HRMs.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating pari-mutuel laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business.   27TwinSpires accepts ADWs from customers of certain states who set up and fund accounts from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet pursuant to the Interstate Horseracing Act and relevant licenses and consents.  The online horse racing wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing ADW pari-mutuel wagering vary from state to state. State attorney generals, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state laws, federal laws, constitutional principles, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do which could have an adverse impact on our business.   Our expansion opportunities with respect to ADW may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit ADW.  Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make ADW expressly unlawful, this could have a material adverse impact on our business.  For example, we ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013 due to the enforcement of a Texas law prohibiting ADW.  Legal challenges and regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our online horse racing wagering business or in any legal challenge to the validity of any restrictions on ADW.    Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states or increase competition for online wagering.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Such effects could have a material adverse impact to the success of our ADW operations. Financial RisksOur debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares,•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments,•make certain investments,•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets,•create liens on certain assets,•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates, and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.Any failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants in our debt facilities and other indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us,•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit, or•could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.28Our insurance costs may increase, we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future, and the extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our operating properties in the event of inclement weather and casualty events, all could adversely affect our businessWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain additional exclusions from our coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, we could be at risk for increased potential losses, which could be substantial.  In addition, our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these requirements, an event of default could result under these debt instruments or material agreements. Furthermore, portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.  Therefore, after carefully weighing the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks, as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage, we may opt to retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.  Retained risks are associated with deductible limits or self-insured retentions, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.Flooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other weather conditions could adversely affect our casino and horse racing locations.  We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, which coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of weather conditions in the future, or if weather conditions adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.We have ""all risk"" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism).  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits and certain exclusions, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.  Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our obligations"
6,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2020-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the CompanyOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Our business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers’ discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations Economic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers’ discretionary spending, including:•Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers’ disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.  •Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  •Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, our online wagering sites and gaming and wagering facilities, and reduced consumer spending overall.Our access to and the cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends.  Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the horse racing, online wagering and casino industries.  Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions.  It is not possible to determine the likelihood, extent or impact of any future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses or any deterioration in our reputation could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersHorse racing, pari-mutuel wagering and casino gaming businesses depend on the public perception of integrity and fairness in their operations.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A lack or loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business. Acts of fraud or cheating in our gaming businesses through the use of counterfeit chips, covert schemes and other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees, may be attempted or committed by our gaming customers with the aim of increasing their winnings. Our gaming customers, visitors and employees may also commit crimes such as theft in order to obtain chips not belonging to them. We have taken measures to safeguard our interests including the implementation of systems, processes and technologies to mitigate against these risks, extensive employee training, surveillance, security and investigation operations and adoption of appropriate security features on our chips such as embedded radio frequency identification tags. Despite our efforts, we may not be successful in preventing or detecting such culpable behavior and schemes in a timely manner and the relevant insurance we have obtained may not be sufficient to cover our losses depending on the incident, which could result in losses to our gaming operations and generate negative publicity, both of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and cash flows.Other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and 17materially damage perceptions of us, our properties, or our industries, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.An inability to attract and retain key and highly-qualified and skilled personnel could impact our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly-qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization.  If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to successfully develop, operate, and grow our business could be impacted. Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate.  As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled employees.  We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth. Certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impact our operations.   Our debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create liens on certain assets;•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.Any failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants in our debt facilities and other indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or•could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.18Ownership and development of our real estate requires significant expenditures and ownership of such properties is subject to risk, including risks related to environmental liabilities We own extensive real estate holdings and make significant capital investments to grow our operations.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  Significant expenditures, including property taxes, debt repayments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property.  Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  Some of our facilities are subject to CAFO regulations.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.  We recently incurred such a penalty in connection with alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds Race Course, as further discussed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings.  Enforcement of such regulations have been receiving increased governmental attention and compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures (including with respect to fines).Our operations rely heavily on technology services, and catastrophic events and system failures with respect to these technology services could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsWe rely on information technology and other systems to manage our business.  A disruption or failure in our technology systems or operations in the event of a cyber-attack, major earthquake, weather event, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss or misuse of our or our customers’ information, litigation and potential liability. In addition, cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our technology systems could impact our operations. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or other damage could interrupt or delay our operations, result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, damage our reputation, subject us to litigation, cause a loss of customers or give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Our online wagering, HRM and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to attempt to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage.  Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our websites and our services could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  Our business is subject to online security risk, including cyber-security breaches.  Loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers’ personal information, could lead to government enforcement actions or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our businessWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer and employee data by maintaining and transmitting customers’ personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information.  Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, and such privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve.  Many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement.  California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the ""CCPA""), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, providing California consumers greater control of the information collected, stored, and sold, and other states are considering similar legislation.  The CCPA provides a private right of action (in addition to statutory damages) for California residents whose sensitive personal information was breached as a result of a business’s violation of its duty to reasonably secure such information.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law.  Any failure on our part to comply with these laws or our privacy policies may subject us to significant liabilities, including governmental enforcement actions or litigation. 19Our systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor, may not be successful. Interruptions in our services or a breach of a customer’s secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, which could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions could also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our casinos.  Such incidents could give rise to remediation costs, monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant.  We attempt to protect against this risk with our property and business interruption insurance, which covers damage or interruption of our systems, although there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential losses.Third-parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our privacy policies, and such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business.  We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association’s contracts with payment card processors.  Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks.  Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. We have insurance coverage for protection against cyber-attacks, which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations, and legal advice.  This insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.   The extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our operating properties in the event of inclement weather and casualty events could adversely affect our businessFlooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other weather conditions could adversely affect our casino and horse racing locations.  We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, which coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of weather conditions in the future, or if weather conditions adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.We have ""all risk"" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism).  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits and certain exclusions, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.  Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our obligations.20Our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the futureWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain additional exclusions from our coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, we could be at risk for increased potential losses, which could be substantial.  In addition, our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these requirements, an event of default could result under these debt instruments or material agreements. Furthermore, portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.  Therefore, after carefully weighing the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks, as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage, we may opt to retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.  Retained risks are associated with deductible limits or self-insured retentions, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.We may not be able to identify and complete expansion, acquisition or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations. We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating such acquisition or development projects.  As described in further detail below, new developments or acquisitions may not be completed or integrated successfully.  The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers.  Current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues.  New properties or developments may not be completed or integrated successfully. We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include the following: •restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;•non-recurring transaction costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and•costs of imposing financial and management controls and operating, administrative and information systems.We perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;•the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition;•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third-party insurers;•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•the potential loss of key employees or customers;21•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The development of new venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos, other gaming venues, or racetracks in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects may require significant capital commitments and the incurrence of additional debt, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.We are subject to significant risks associated with our equity investments, strategic alliances and other third-party agreementsWe pursue certain license opportunities, development projects and other strategic business opportunities through equity investments, joint ventures, license arrangements and other alliances with third-parties.  Our equity investments are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our co-investors and therefore, we do not unilaterally control the applicable entity or other initiatives. The terms of the equity investments and the rights of our co-investors may preclude us from taking actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company. Disagreements with our co-investors could result in delays in project development, including construction delays, and ultimate failure of the project.  Our co-investors also may not be able to provide capital to the applicable entity on the terms agreed to or at all, and the applicable entity may be unable to obtain external financing to finance its operations. Also, our ability to exit the equity investments may be subject to contractual and other limitations.With any third-party arrangement, there is a risk that our partners’ economic, business or legal interests or objectives may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements and/or failure of the applicable project or initiative.  We are also subject to risks relating to our co-investors’ failure to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners and changes in the ownership of any of our co-investors.Any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionOur Online Wagering and Gaming segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  It may be difficult to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive. We may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of othersIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties, and such other parties may allege that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights.  Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future.  We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products.We may be unable to adequately protect our own intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business and results of operationsOur results of operations may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights.  Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property used in our products, including in the areas of advance deposit wagering could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. 22Some of our businesses are based upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property.  Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented and other technologies and trade secrets that we use to develop and market our businesses.  We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.  If we are not successful in protecting these rights, the value of our brands and our business could be adversely impacted.We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code.  If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code.  This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.  Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks. Competitors may devise new methods of competing with us which may not be covered by our patents or patent applications.  Our patent applications may not be approved, the patents we have may not adequately protect our intellectual property or ongoing business strategies and our patents may be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country.The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States; therefore, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies adequately against unauthorized copying or use in certain jurisdictions. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties.  These licensees may take actions that could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity.  To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations. Any of these events could harm our business and results of operations.We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customersWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (""EFT"") and credit and debit cards.  As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements.  We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability.  We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.  We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.  If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions.  Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided.  In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks.  Our control procedures to protect from chargebacks may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.23We face risks related to pending or future legal proceedings and other actions From time to time, we are a party in various lawsuits and judicial and governmental actions in the ordinary course of business. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these lawsuits and actions which can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits or actions, which could result in settlements, costs or damages that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.  Such matters may include investigations or litigation from various parties, including vendors, customers, state and federal agencies, stockholders and employees relating to intellectual property, employment, consumer, personal injury, corporate governance, commercial or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. We have been subject to claims in cases concerning class action allegations. Plaintiffs in class action lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss and defense costs relating to such lawsuits may not be accurately estimated. We evaluate all of the claims and proceedings involving us to assess the expected outcome, and where possible, we estimate the amount of potential losses to us. In many cases, including class action matters, we may not be able to estimate the amount of potential losses and/or our estimates may prove to be insufficient. These assessments are made by management based on the information available at the time made and require the use of a significant amount of judgment, and actual outcomes or losses may materially differ. Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend and may divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact earnings. Further, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance to protect us from these types of litigation matters or extraordinary business losses.Our operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks, and the failure to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionOur operations in certain jurisdictions depend on agreements with third parties.  If we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms as they expire, our business may be disrupted.  For example, the Interstate Horseracing Act, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing.  Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the ""Horsemen’s Groups"").  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, the Horsemen's Groups on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third-parties’ races could have a material adverse impact on our business, as such failure will result in our inability to conduct live racing and export and import simulcasting. From time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the ""FHBPA""), which represents horsemen in Florida, and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also have written agreements with certain Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana, Florida, and Kentucky.  Florida law requires Calder to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to breeders’ stallion and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted by Calder before receiving a license to conduct slot machine gaming. We have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities, OTBs, and ADWs.  From time to time, we may be unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans and limit our operational flexibilitySome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We may experience additional union activity in the future.  Any such union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our business and result in significant costs.24Risks Related to Our Churchill Downs SegmentOur Churchill Downs Racetrack and the Kentucky Derby may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences, attendance, wagering, and sponsorships  Our Churchill Downs Racetrack is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined on average 3% per year from 2008 to 2016 due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives.  From 2016 to 2019, pari-mutuel handle on horse racing has been relatively stable with average annual growth of 2%.   If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Churchill Downs segment.  If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The number and level of sponsorships are important to the success of the the Kentucky Derby.  Our ability to retain sponsors, acquire new sponsors, and complete for sponsorships and advertising dollars could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationPersonal injuries and injuries to horses have occurred during races or workouts, and may continue to occur, which could subject us to litigation.  We carry insurance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and each of our other racetracks; however, there are certain exclusions.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.  Our results of operations may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as it could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racingWe have a limited number of live racing days at Churchill Downs Racetrack, and the number of live racing days could vary from year to year.  A significant portion of our racing revenue is generated during the Kentucky Derby and Oaks week.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs Racetrack at a time that would affect the Kentucky Derby and Oaks week, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Since horse racing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends.  Extreme weather events that are linked to rising temperatures, changing global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperatures, as well as sea levels, rain and snow could result in increased occurrence and severity of adverse weather events.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our business could be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks and public health threatsThe success of the Kentucky Derby and Oaks week is dependent upon the willingness and ability of patrons to attend events at Churchill Downs Racetrack, which is subject to the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events that may discourage attendance, decrease revenue, or expose us to substantial liability.  Terrorist activity, including acts of domestic terrorism, or other actions that discourage attendance at other locations, or even the threat of such activity, including public concerns regarding air travel, military actions and additional national or local catastrophic incidents, could result in reduced attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack. A major epidemic or pandemic, or the threat of such an event, could also adversely affect attendance at Churchill Downs Racetrack and could impact the supply chain for our major construction projects resulting in higher costs and delays of the projects.  While we are constantly evaluating the security precautions in an effort to ensure the safety of the public, no security measures can guarantee safety and there can be no assurances of avoiding potential liabilities. The occurrence or threat of any such extraordinary event at Churchill Downs Racetrack could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. 25Our Churchill Downs segment operations are highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur Churchill Downs segment is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized pari-mutuel wagering in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing (including HRM) facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities.  To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for operation.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to obtain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct or our racing (including HRM) operations, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.  In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.  If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of HRMs.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating pari-mutuel laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business.   Our Churchill Downs segment faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseChurchill Downs Racetrack and Derby City Gaming face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, VLTs, state-sponsored lotteries, sports wagering, and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenue for race purses and capital improvements.   Competition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges.  Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, Churchill Downs and our other racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both continued operations and expansion.  Churchill Downs Racetrack also faces significantly greater operating costs compared to costs borne by online and web-based gaming companies.  Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-based gaming companies.  These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks. Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horse racesWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields. A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horse races.  Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors, including our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and the overall horse population available for racing.  Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases.  If Churchill Downs Racetrack is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it could have a material impact on our profitability.  If we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease. Our business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator services Our customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horse races.  The failure to keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively, limit our ability to develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product.  A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horse racing.  A totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if wagering is unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume. 26United Tote also has licenses and contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses.  Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner.  Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Risks Related to Our TwinSpires BusinessOur online horse racing wagering business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessTwinSpires accepts ADWs from customers of certain states who set up and fund accounts from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet pursuant to the Interstate Horseracing Act and relevant licenses and consents.  The online horse racing wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing ADW vary from state to state. Some states have expressly authorized ADW by residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or ADW and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited residents of the state from placing wagers through ADW hubs located in different states.  We believe that an online horse racing wagering business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to ADW businesses in other states is not prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions.  However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.  In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate ADW. Our expansion opportunities with respect to ADW may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit ADW.  Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make ADW expressly unlawful, this could have a material adverse impact on our business.  For example, we ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013 due to the enforcement of a Texas law prohibiting ADW.  Legal challenges and regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our online horse racing wagering business or in any legal challenge to the validity of any restrictions on ADW.  From time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for ADW. Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states or increase competition for online wagering.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Such effects could have a material adverse impact to the success of our ADW operations. Our TwinSpires business may be adversely affected by the number of people wagering on live horse races Our TwinSpires business is dependent on wagering on live horse races at our racetracks and third-party racetracks.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined on average 3% per year from 2008 to 2016 due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives.  From 2016 to 2019, pari-mutuel handle on horse racing has been relatively stable with average annual growth of 2%.  If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Online Wagering segment.  If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our TwinSpires business faces strong competition and we expect competition to increaseOur TwinSpires business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses.  Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our mobile and online wagering business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other ADW businesses.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do.  We may also be unable to retain our core customer base if we fail to continue to offer robust content offerings and other popular features.  We anticipate increased competition in our mobile and online business from various other forms of online gaming, and our potential inability to retain customers or our failure to attract new customers could adversely affect our business. 27Our TwinSpires business is subject to a variety of laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our businessWe are subject to a variety of laws, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing.  The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting.  Laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories.  It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these or new laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.  This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services which could harm our business.  The increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Risks Related to Our Sports Betting and iGaming BusinessOur ability to predict and capitalize on the legalization of online sports betting and iGaming in the United States may impact our business, and we expect that competition will continue to grow and intensifyA number of states have passed or are currently considering passing online sports betting and iGaming legislation.  If a large number of additional states or the federal government enact online sports betting or iGaming legislation and we are unable to obtain, or are otherwise delayed in obtaining, the necessary licenses to operate online sports betting or iGaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in online sports betting and iGaming could be materially impaired. States or the federal government may prevent online sports betting and iGaming or legalize online sports betting and iGaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us.  If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online sports betting and iGaming subject to a brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online sports betting and iGaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction on acceptable terms. We expect that we will face increased competition for online sports betting and iGaming as the potential for legalized online sports betting and iGaming continues to grow.  In the online sports betting and iGaming industry, a ""first mover"" advantage exists.  Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online sports betting and iGaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors.  Failing to do so could materially impair our ability to grow in the online sports betting and iGaming space.  We may fail to accurately predict when online sports betting and iGaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions.  The legislative process in each state and at the federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change.  If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online sports betting and iGaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online sports betting and iGaming offerings in such jurisdictions, which could have a material impact on our business.We intend to expand our sports betting operations and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, that our expansion initiatives will be successful, or that we will generate sufficient returns on our investmentDuring the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting.  As a result, several jurisdictions in which we operate legalized sports betting and additional jurisdictions may do so in the future.  Our ability to be successful with our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on potential legislation in various jurisdictions that affect the sports betting industry in the United States.  We continue to engage with state lawmakers in our other jurisdictions to advocate for the passage of sports betting laws with reasonable tax rates and license fees.  Our sports betting operations will compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors.  In order to compete successfully, we may need to enter into agreements with strategic partners and other third-party vendors and we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us.  There can be no assurances when, or if, regulations enabling sports betting and online sportsbooks, casino gaming and poker will be adopted, or the terms of such regulations, in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate.  The success of our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the ultimate tax rates and license fees charged by jurisdictions across the United States, our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market, the potential that the market does not develop as we anticipate, the competitive landscape, and our ability to compete with new entrants in the market, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, the performance of and licensing of third- party vendors, and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. 28Failure to manage risks associated with sports betting may impact profitability Sports betting operators serve as the house for wagers and must manage the risks of balancing wagers on specific events and markets unlike pari-mutuel wagering, where the operator takes a percentage of each wager.  Sports wagering operators must manage risk and protect against the expertise of well-informed and sophisticated customers that may be unprofitable.  We use automated risk management processes and an experienced team to manage this risk; however, our inability to manage the inherent risks associated with sports wagering could have a material adverse impact on our sports wagering business.Failure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon geographic location, may result in legal penalties or impairment to our ability to offer our online wagering products, in generalIndividuals in jurisdictions in which online gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online gaming products.  While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful.  In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online gaming is illegal engage our online gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, or the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. Gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations.  If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal. Risks Related to Our Gaming BusinessOur gaming business faces significant competition from brick-and-mortar casinos and other gaming and entertainment alternatives, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur casinos operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources.  Our casino operations face competition from land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racetracks, Native American casinos, VLTs, state-sponsored lotteries, iGaming, and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  There has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market, and legislative changes.  We do not have the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them.  In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors may pay lower taxes or no taxes. These factors could create challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow for our casino products that enable us to remain competitive.  Legislators in Florida continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos.  Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure.  Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. The gaming industry also faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Online and mobile interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on online and mobile activities are clarified.  We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry and such increased competition may have an adverse impact on our business. Our gaming business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur gaming operations exist at the discretion of the states in which we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation.  These regulatory authorities have broad discretion and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations.  Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved.  While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals currently necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals in the future, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations.  The loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect or eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  Also, the gaming and other laws and regulations to which we are subject could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”). The DOJ’s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity but a federal judge ordered in 2019 that the Wire Act applies only to wagers on a 29sporting event or contest.  The DOJ is currently appealing this decision.  Any such material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.The Bank Secrecy Act, enforced by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Treasury Department, requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the guest by name and social security number, to the IRS.  This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds, in response to which we have implemented Know Your Customer Processes.  Periodic audits by the IRS and our internal audit department assess compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, and substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation.  In recent years the U.S. Treasury Department has increased its focus on Bank Secrecy Act compliance throughout the gaming industry, and public comments by FinCEN suggest that casinos should obtain information on each customer’s sources of income.  This could impact our ability to attract and retain casino guests.Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business.  The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy. The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenue is attributable to slot, VLTs, and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities, and there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the United States in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector.  Recently, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation and slot machine manufacturers have occasionally refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental.  Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.  If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.We rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations.  Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk. We extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customersWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis at many of our properties. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. Table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible.  Gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a “marker,” and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis, and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all U.S. states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution. However, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.30"
3,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2019-02-27,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the CompanyOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Our business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers’ discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations Economic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers’ discretionary spending, including:•Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers’ disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.  •Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  •Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, gaming and wagering facilities and our online wagering sites and reduced consumer spending overall.Our access to and the cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends.  Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the horseracing, online wagering and casino industries.  Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. tax jurisdictions and judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions.  It is not possible to determine the likelihood, extent or impact of any future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersHorseracing, pari-mutuel wagering and casino gaming businesses depend on the public perception of integrity and fairness in their operations.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, the necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A lack or loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business. We depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmedWe believe that our success depends in part on our highly-skilled employee base, and our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization.  If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations.  In such case, our ability to operate, develop and successfully grow our business could be impaired. Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate.  As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly skilled employees.  We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth. Certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may 19require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impair our operations.   Our debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create liens on certain assets;•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.Any failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants in our debt facilities and other indebtedness could have a material adverse impact on our business  Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the financial ratios and other covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and could terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or•could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.Ownership and development of our real estate requires significant expenditures and ownership of such properties is subject to risk, including risks related to environmental liabilities Our operations require us to own extensive real estate holdings.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  Significant expenditures, including property taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property.  Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.  For instance, we are currently in discussions with the EPA regarding potential remedial actions relating to alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds and expect to incur certain capital expenditures to upgrade these facilities to resolve this issue.  Enforcement of CAFO regulations have been receiving increased governmental attention and compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures.20Our operations rely heavily on technology services, and catastrophic events and system failures with respect to these technology services could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsWe rely on information technology and other systems to manage our business.  A disruption or failure in our technology systems or operations in the event of a cyber-attack, major earthquake, weather event, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.   Our online wagering, HRM and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to attempt to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage.  Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our websites and our services could result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  Our business is subject to online security risk, including cyber-security breaches.  Loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers’ personal information, could lead to government enforcement actions or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our businessWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer and employee data by maintaining and transmitting customers’ personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, mailing lists and reservations information.  Our collection of such data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups, such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities, including gaming authorities.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data, and such privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve.  Many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement.  In addition, California has adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which goes into effect on January 1, 2020, providing California consumers greater control of the information collected, stored, and sold, and other states are considering similar legislation.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law.  Any failure on our part to comply with these laws or our privacy policies may subject us to significant liabilities, including governmental enforcement actions or litigation. Further, our systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, may not be successful. Interruptions in our services or a breach of a customer’s secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, which could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions could also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our games.  We attempt to protect against this risk with our property and business interruption insurance, which covers damage or interruption of our systems, although there is no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover all potential losses.Third parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our privacy policies, and such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business.  We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association’s contracts with payment card processors.  Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, and hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks.  Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players. The costs to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. As threats related to cyber-attacks develop and grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our results of operations. We 21have insurance coverage for protection against cyber-attacks, which may not be sufficient to cover all possible claims, and we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.   The extent to which we can recover under our insurance policies for damages sustained at our operating properties in the event of inclement weather and casualty events could adversely affect our businessFlooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other weather conditions could adversely affect our casino and horseracing locations.  We maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, which coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of weather conditions in the future, or if weather conditions adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.We have ""all risk"" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism).  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits and certain exclusions, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.  Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to fund replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payment of our obligations.Our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the futureWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain additional exclusions from our coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage, we will be at risk for increased potential losses, which could be substantial.  In addition, our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage to satisfy these requirements an event of default could result under these debt instruments or material agreements. Furthermore, portions of our business are difficult or impracticable to insure.  Therefore, after carefully weighing the costs, risks, and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks, as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage, we may opt to retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies.  Retained risks are associated with deductible limits or self-insured retentions, partial self-insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings.We may not be able to identify and complete expansion, acquisition or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations. We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects.  New developments or acquisitions may not be completed or integrated successfully.  The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers.  Current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues.  New properties or developments may not be completed or integrated successfully. We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include the following: •restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;22•non-recurring acquisition costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and•costs of imposing financial and management controls and operating, administrative and information systems.We perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;•the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition;•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third party insurers;•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•the potential loss of key employees or customers;•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our Racing segment and TwinSpires business may be adversely affected by the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races Our Racing segment is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at our racetracks and our Online Wagering segment is dependent on wagering on live horse races at our racetracks and third-party racetracks.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined on average 3% per year from 2008 to 2016 due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives.  From 2016 to 2018, pari-mutuel handle on horse racing has been relatively stable with average annual growth of 2%.   If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Racing segment and our Online Wagering segment.  If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionOur Online Wagering and Casino segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  It may be difficult to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive. We may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of othersIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties, and such other parties may allege that we are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights.  Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future.  We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products.23We may be unable to adequately protect our own intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business and results of operationsOur results of operations may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights.  Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property used in our products, including in the areas of advance deposit wagering could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Some of our businesses are based upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented and other technologies and trade secrets that we use to develop and market our businesses.  We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.  If we are not successful in protecting these rights, the value of our brands and our business could be adversely impacted.We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code.  If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code.  This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.  Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks. Competitors may devise new methods of competing with us which may not be covered by our patents or patent applications.  Our patent applications may not be approved, the patents we have may not adequately protect our intellectual property or ongoing business strategies and our patents may be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country.The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States; therefore, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies adequately against unauthorized copying or use in certain jurisdictions. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties.  These licensees may take actions that could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity.  To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations. Any of these events could harm our business and results of operations.We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customersWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (""EFT"") and credit and debit cards.  As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements.  We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability.  We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.  We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply.  If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions.  Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided.  In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks.  Our control procedures to protect from chargebacks may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties. It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions. If our employees or agents fail to comply with 24applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.  We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.We face risks related to pending or future legal proceedings and other actions From time to time, we are a party in various lawsuits and judicial and governmental actions in the ordinary course of business. No assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these lawsuits and actions which can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits or actions, which could result in settlements, costs or damages that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plans and limit our operational flexibilitySome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We may experience additional union activity in the future.  Any such union organization efforts could cause disruptions in our business and result in significant costs.Risks Related to Our Racing BusinessWe may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horseracesWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields. A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horseraces.  Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors, including our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and the overall horse population available for racing.  Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases.  If any of our racetracks is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it could have a material impact on our profitability.  If we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease. We depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks, and the failure to enter into or maintain these agreements on terms acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditionThe Interstate Horseracing Act, or IHA, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing.  Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the ""Horsemen’s Groups"").  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, the Horsemen's Groups on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third parties’ races could have a material adverse impact on our business. From time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the ""FHBPA""), which represents horsemen in Florida, and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also have written agreements with the Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana and Florida.  Florida law requires Calder to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder Racing and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to breeders’ stallion and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder Racing before Calder can receive a license to conduct slot machine gaming. We have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities.  From time 25to time, we may be unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Horseracing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationPersonal injuries may occur during races or daily workouts, which could subject us to litigation.  We carry insurance at each of our racetracks; however, there are certain exclusions.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.  Our results of operations may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as it could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator services Our customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horseraces.  The failure to keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively, limit our ability to develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product.  A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horseracing.  A totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume. United Tote also has licenses and contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses.  Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner.  Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racingWe conduct our racing business at four thoroughbred racetracks (Churchill Downs, Arlington, Fair Grounds, and Presque Isle) and harness racing at Ocean Downs and through our equity investment at MVG.  We have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks, and the number of live racing days varies from year to year.  A significant portion of our racing revenue is generated during the Kentucky Derby and Oaks week.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs at a time that would affect the Kentucky Derby and Oaks week, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Since horseracing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our racing business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseAll of our racetracks face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, VLTs, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.All of our racetracks face competition in the simulcast market.  In 2018, approximately 37,000 thoroughbred horse races were conducted in the United States.  We hosted approximately 2,220 races, or approximately 6.0% of the total number of thoroughbred horse races in the United States in 2018.  As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races.  As a racetrack operator, we also compete with other racetracks running live meets at or near the same time as our horse races.  In recent years, this competition has increased as more states have allowed additional, automated gaming activities, such as slot machines at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions.We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenue for race purses and capital improvements.  Churchill Downs and Arlington have experienced heightened competition from ""racinos"" in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, and West Virginia whose purses are supplemented by gaming revenue.  Competition from these facilities could harm our ability to attract full fields, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Competition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges for our racing business.  Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, our racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both continued operations and expansion.  Our racing business also faces significantly greater operating costs compared to costs borne by online and web-26based gaming companies.  Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-based gaming companies.  These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks. Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our racing operations are highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur racing business is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized pari-mutuel wagering in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing (including HRM) facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities, including authorities in Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Florida, Ohio, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.  To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to obtain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our racing business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct or our racing (including HRM) operations, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.  In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect our eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  In addition to licensing requirements, state regulatory authorities can have a significant impact on the operation of our business.  In Illinois, the IRB has the authority to designate racetracks as ""host tracks"" for the purpose of receiving host track revenue generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races.  Racetracks that are designated as ""host tracks"" obtain and distribute out-of-state simulcast signals for the State of Illinois.  Under Illinois law, the ""host track"" is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on related pari-mutuel wagering.  The IRB has designated Arlington as a ""host track.""  Should Arlington cease to be a ""host track,"" the loss of hosting revenue could have an adverse impact on our business.  Arlington is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenue monies that are otherwise payable to Arlington’s purse account.  These statutorily or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session, and a reduction or elimination of any of these revenue sources could have an adverse impact on our business. We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.  If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, and numbers and types of HRMs.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating pari-mutuel laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business.   Risks Related to Our TwinSpires BusinessOur online horseracing wagering business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessTwinSpires accepts advance deposit wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund accounts from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet.  The online horseracing wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing ADW vary from state to state. Some states have expressly authorized ADW by residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or ADW and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited residents of the state from placing wagers through ADW hubs located in different states.  We believe that an online horseracing wagering business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to ADW businesses in other states is not expressly prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions.  However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.  In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate ADW. Our expansion opportunities with respect to ADW may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit ADW.  Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make ADW expressly unlawful, this could have a material adverse impact on our business.  For example, we ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013 due to the enforcement of an existing Texas law prohibiting ADW.  Regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our online horseracing wagering business.  From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for ADW. Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-27governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Such effects could have a material adverse impact to the success of our ADW operations. Our online horseracing wagering business faces strong competition and we expect competition to increaseOur online horseracing wagering business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses.  Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our mobile and online wagering business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other ADW businesses.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do.  We may also be unable to retain our core customer base if we fail to continue to offer robust content offerings and other popular features.  We anticipate increased competition in our mobile and online business from various other forms of online gaming, and our potential inability to retain customers or our failure to attract new customers could adversely affect our business. Our online wagering business is subject to a variety of laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our businessWe are subject to a variety of laws, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing.  The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting.  Laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories.  It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these or new laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.  This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services which could harm our business.  The increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Risks Related to Our Sports Betting and iGaming BusinessThe legalization of online sports betting and iGaming in the United States and our ability to predict and capitalize on any such legalization may impact our business, and we expect that competition will continue to grow and intensifyA number of states have or are currently considering online sports betting and iGaming.  If a large number of additional states or the federal government enact online sports betting or iGaming legislation and we are unable to obtain, or are otherwise delayed in obtaining, the necessary licenses to operate online sports betting or iGaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in online sports betting and iGaming could be materially impaired. States or the federal government may legalize online sports betting and iGaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us.  Several states and the federal government are considering draft laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and-mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate.  If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online sports betting and iGaming subject to a brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online sports betting and iGaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction on acceptable terms. Further, we expect that we will face increased competition for online sports betting and iGaming as the potential for legalized online sports betting and iGaming continues to grow.  In the online sports betting and iGaming industry, a ""first mover"" advantage exists.  Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online sports betting and iGaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors.  Failing to do so could materially impair our ability to grow in the online sports betting and iGaming space.  We may fail to accurately predict when online sports betting and iGaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions.  The legislative process in each state and at the federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change.  If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online sports betting and iGaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online sports betting and iGaming offerings in such jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.28We intend to expand our sports betting operations.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that our expansion initiatives will be successful and generate sufficient returns on our investmentDuring the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal ban on sports betting.  In the second quarter of 2018, we entered into an agreement with Golden Nugget Atlantic City to enter into the New Jersey market, and went live with our online sports betting and online casino platform in February 2019.  We began accepting wagers on sporting events during the third quarter of 2018 at our retail BetAmerica Sportsbook at Harlow’s and Riverwalk in Mississippi, and we anticipate implementing sports betting in Pennsylvania following our recently completed acquisition of Presque Isle in January 2019.  Our ability to be successful with our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on potential legislation in various jurisdictions that affect the sports betting industry in the United States.  We continue to engage with state lawmakers in our other jurisdictions to advocate for the passage of sports betting laws with reasonable tax rates and license fees.  Our sports betting operations will compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive market against an increasing number of competitors.  In order to compete successfully, we may need to enter into agreements with strategic partners and other third party vendors and we may not be able to do so on terms that are favorable to us.  The success of our proposed sports betting operations is dependent on a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including the ultimate tax rates and license fees charged by jurisdictions across the United States, our ability to gain market share in a newly developing market, our ability to compete with new entrants in the market, changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences, the performance of and licensing of third party vendors, and the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment. Failure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon geographic location, may result in legal penalties or impairment to our ability to offer our online wagering products, in generalIndividuals in jurisdictions in which online gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online gaming products.  While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful.  In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online gaming is illegal engage our online gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, or the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. Gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations.  If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal. Risks Related to Our Casino BusinessOur casino business faces significant competition from brick-and-mortar casinos and other gaming and entertainment alternatives, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur casinos operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources.  Our casino operations face competition from land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks, Native American casinos, VLTs, state-sponsored lotteries, iGaming, and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  There has been significant competition in our markets as a result of the expansion of facilities by existing market participants, the entrance of new gaming participants into a market, and legislative changes in prior years.  We do not have the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them.  Legislators in Florida continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos.  Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure.  Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. The gaming industry also faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Web-based interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on web-based activities are clarified.  We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry and such increased competition may have an adverse impact on our business. Our casino business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur casino operations exist at the discretion of the states in which we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation.  These regulatory authorities have broad discretion and may, for any reason set forth in the applicable legislation, rules and regulations, limit, condition, suspend, fail to renew or revoke a license or registration to conduct gaming operations.  Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved.  While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals currently necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals in the future, or that we will be able to obtain future 29approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations.  In addition, the loss of a license in one jurisdiction could trigger the loss of a license or affect or eligibility for a license in another jurisdiction.  Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business.  The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy. The development of new casino venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos or other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business.The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenue is attributable to slot and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities, and there are a limited number of slot machine manufacturers servicing the gaming industry.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  A substantial majority of the slot machines sold in the United States in recent years were manufactured by a few select companies, and there has been extensive consolidation activity within the gaming equipment sector.  Recently, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation and slot machine manufacturers have occasionally refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental.  Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.  If the newer slot machines do not result in sufficient incremental revenue to offset the increased investment, it could adversely affect our operations and profitability.We rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations.  Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk"
0,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2018-02-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the CompanyIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and us could materially impact our future performance and results.  The factors described below are the most significant risks that could have a material impact our business.Our business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers’ discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations Economic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers’ discretionary spending.•Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers’ disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.  •Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  •Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, gaming and wagering facilities and our online wagering sites and could reduce consumer spending.Our access to and cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends.  Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming. As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time. From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the gaming industry. Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations. It is not possible to determine the likelihood or extent of any such future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersThe integrity of the horseracing, casino gaming and pari-mutuel wagering industries must be perceived as fair to patrons and the public at large. To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, the necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated. A loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business. We depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmedWe believe that our success depends in part on our highly-skilled employee base, and our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization. If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be impaired, which could harm our business. Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate. As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly-skilled employees. We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth. All of our officers and other employees in the United States are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace. Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the skills and efforts of our senior executives and management team. We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with 18us, and their retention is affected by the competitiveness of our terms of employment and our ability to compete effectively against other companies. Certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impair our operations. Our inability to retain key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create liens on certain assets;•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or•require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.If the indebtedness under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.Ownership and development of real estate requires significant expenditures and is subject to risk Our operations require us to own extensive real estate holdings. All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants. Significant expenditures, including property taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property. Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination. If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions. For instance, we are currently in discussions 19with the EPA regarding potential remedial actions relating to alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds and expect to incur certain capital expenditures to upgrade these facilities to resolve this issue. Catastrophic events and system failures could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsA disruption or failure in our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas. Flooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes or hurricanes could adversely affect our locations. While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, our coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits. We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters. If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of natural disasters in the future, or if natural disasters adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our mobile and online wagering and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware. We have built certain redundancies into our systems to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage; however, certain risks still exist. Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our website and our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue. Interruptions in our services or a breach of customers’ secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our site, and could permanently harm our reputation and brand. These interruptions also increase the burden on our engineering staff which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our games. We have property and business interruption insurance covering damage or interruption of our systems; however, this insurance might not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur. We have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism); however, each policy has certain exclusions. Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements. We may not be able to identify and complete expansion, acquisition or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations. We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects. New developments or acquisitions may not be completed or integrated successfully. The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers. Current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues. New properties or developments may not be completed or integrated successfully. We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future. The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns. We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all. Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources. The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities of those businesses which could have a material adverse impact on our business. The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results. These costs could include the following: •restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;20•non-recurring acquisition costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and•costs of imposing financial and management controls (such as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and operating, administrative and information systems.We perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase; however, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;•the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition;•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third party insurers;•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•the potential loss of key employees or customers;•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The legalization of online real money gaming in the United States and our ability to predict and capitalize on any such legalization may impact our businessNevada, Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have enacted legislation to legalize online real money gaming. In recent years, California, Mississippi, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Washington D.C. and West Virginia have considered such legislation. If a large number of additional states or the Federal government enact online real money gaming legislation and we are unable to obtain the necessary licenses to operate online real money gaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in real money gaming could be materially impaired. States or the Federal government may legalize online real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us. Several states and the Federal government are considering draft laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction on acceptable terms. In the online real money gaming industry, a significant “first mover” advantage exists. Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online real money gaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors. Failing to do so (“move first”) could materially impair our ability to grow in the online real money gaming space. We may fail to accurately predict when online real money gaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions. The legislative process in each state and at the Federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change. If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online real money gaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online real money gaming offerings in such jurisdictions which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our business may be adversely affected by the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races Our Racing segment is dependent upon the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at our racetracks and our TwinSpires segment is dependent on wagering on live horse races at our racetracks and third-party racetracks.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle on average declined 2% per year from 2008 to 2017 due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives.  From 2014 to 2017, pari-mutuel handle on horse 21racing has been relatively stable with average annual growth of 1%.   If interest in horse racing is lower in the future, it may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our Racing segment and our TwinSpires segment.  If attendance at and wagering on live horse racing declines, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner which may cause customer dissatisfactionCasino and TwinSpires segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and continuous introduction of new products. Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network; however, we may not be able to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources. Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements including the development of new wagering platforms and features. While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner. Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive. We may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of othersIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties. Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future. We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products. Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of our products and services if we become subject to litigation relating to intellectual property infringement. We may be unable to adequately protect our own intellectual property rights Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property used in our products, including in the areas of advance deposit wagering could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Some of our businesses are based upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented and other technologies and trade secrets that we use to develop and market our businesses. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our intellectual property rights. If we are not successful in protecting these rights, the value of our brands and our business could be adversely impacted.Competitors may devise new methods of competing with us which may not be covered by our patents or patent applications. Our patent applications may not be approved, the patents we have may not adequately protect our intellectual property or ongoing business strategies and our patents may be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable. Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country. The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States; therefore, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies adequately against unauthorized copying or use in certain jurisdictions. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties. These licensees may take actions that could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity. To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations. Any of these events could harm our business.Our business is subject to online security risk, including security breaches, and loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers’ personal information, could lead to government enforcement action or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our businessWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer data. There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation 22or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse impact on our business. In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement. The costs of compliance with these types of laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law. Any failure on our part to comply with these types of laws may subject us to significant liabilities. Third parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our policies, and such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business. We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association’s contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties. If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs. Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry. Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks. Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business. Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players. We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor; however, such measures cannot provide absolute security. We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customersWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (“EFT”), and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks. We place great emphasis on control procedures to protect from chargebacks; however, these control procedures may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties.  It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.  If our employees or agents fail to comply with 23applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.  Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plansSome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We may experience additional and more successful union activity in the future.Risks Related to Our Racing BusinessWe may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horseracesWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields. A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horseraces. Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors, including our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and the overall horse population available for racing. Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases. If any of our racetracks is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it could have a material impact on our profitability. If we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease. We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenue for race purses and capital improvements. Churchill Downs and Arlington have experienced heightened competition from racinos in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia whose purses are supplemented by gaming revenue. The opening of the Genting New York Resort at Aqueduct racetrack has enhanced the purse structure at New York racetracks as compared to historical levels. In February 2017, the Rivers Casino & Resort Schenectady opened in New York. Competition from these facilities could harm our ability to attract full fields, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. We depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracksThe Interstate Horseracing Act, or IHA, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the “Horsemen’s Groups”). These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races. The agreements between other racetracks and their Horsemen’s Groups typically provide that those racetracks must receive consent from the Horsemen’s Groups before we can accept wagers on their races. We may not be able to maintain agreements with, or to obtain required consent from, Horsemen’s Groups. We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis. The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, our horsemen on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third parties’ races could have a material adverse impact on our business. From time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the “FHBPA”), which represents horsemen in Florida, and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks. Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business. We also have written agreements with the Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana and Florida. Florida law requires Calder Casino to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to breeders’ stallion and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder before Calder can receive a license to conduct slot machine gaming. 24We have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities. From time to time, we are unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us. As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks. The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business. Horseracing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationPersonal injuries to jockeys may occur during races or daily workouts. We carry jockey accident insurance at each of our racetracks to cover such injuries; however, there are certain exclusions to our insurance coverage, and we are still subject to litigation from injured participants. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage. Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as this litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator servicesOur customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horseraces. The failure to keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively, limit our ability to develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product. A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horseracing. A totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume. United Tote also has licenses and contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses. Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner. Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racingWe conduct our racing business at three thoroughbred racetracks: Churchill Downs, Fair Grounds and Arlington; and, through separate joint ventures and equity investments, at three harness racetracks: Miami Valley, Ocean Downs, and Saratoga Harness. A significant portion of our racing revenue is generated during the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby week. If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs at a time that would affect the Kentucky Oaks or Kentucky Derby, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Since horseracing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering. Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties. If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our racing business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseAll of our racetracks face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, VLTs, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.All of our racetracks face competition in the simulcast market.  In 2017, approximately 37,000 thoroughbred horse races were conducted in the United States.  We hosted approximately 2,200 races, or about 5.9% of the total.  As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races.  As a racetrack operator, we also compete with other racetracks running live meets at or near the same time as our horse races.  In recent years, this competition has increased as more states have allowed additional, automated gaming activities, such as slot machines at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions.Competition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges for our racing business. Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, our racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both continued operations and expansion. Our racing business also faces significantly greater operating costs compared to costs borne by online and web-based gaming companies. Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-based gaming companies. These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks. Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business. 25Our racing operations are highly regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur racing business is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized gaming in states where we operate. Our wagering and racing facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities, including authorities in Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Florida, Ohio, Maryland and New York. To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks. However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses. The failure to attain such licenses in the future or the loss of or material change in our racing business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct, and could have a material adverse impact on our business. In addition to licensing requirements, state regulatory authorities can have a significant impact on the operation of our business. In Illinois, the IRB has the authority to designate racetracks as “host track” for the purpose of receiving host track revenue generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races. Racetracks that are designated as “host track” obtain and distribute out of state simulcast signals for the State of Illinois. Under Illinois law, the “host track” is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on the related pari-mutuel wagering. Should Arlington cease to be a “host track”, the loss of hosting revenue could have an adverse impact on our business. Arlington is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenue monies that are otherwise payable to Arlington’s purse account. These statutorily or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session, and a reduction or elimination of any of these revenue sources could have an adverse impact on our business. We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages. If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our racing business experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in operating results and a decrease in live racing days may adversely impact our businessWe experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to seasonality and other factors. We have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks, and the number of live racing days varies from year to year. The number of live racing days may be adversely impacted by factors including inclement weather, our ability to negotiate certain agreements with industry groups (in particular groups working on behalf of horsemen), jockey walkouts and other negotiation issues with independent contractors, and contagious equine disease. The number of live racing days we are able to offer directly affects our results of operations. A significant decrease in the number of live racing days and/or live races offered during our Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby week could have a material adverse impact on our business. Risks Related to Our Casino BusinessOur casino business faces significant competition from brick-and-mortar casinos and other gaming and entertainment alternatives, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur casinos operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources. Our casino operations face competition from Native American casinos, VLTs, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Increased competition in the New York area could provide additional competitive pressure.  We do not enjoy the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them. Legislators in Florida continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos. Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure. Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our business. The gaming industry also faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Web-based interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on web-based activities are clarified. We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry and such increased competition may have an adverse impact on our business. Our casino business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur casino operations exist at the discretion of the states where we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved. While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals currently necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals in the future, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations. 26Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines and loss limits. Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business. The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy. The development of new casino venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos or other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business.The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenue is attributable to slot and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities. It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests. In recent years, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation. In recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines. Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win. Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine. For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines. We materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate. We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk. Our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking. Legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking in public places has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including in or near jurisdictions in which we operate. The smoking bans and restrictions have negatively impacted our business in New Orleans, where the New Orleans City Council unanimously approved an ordinance prohibiting smoking in casinos, bars and restaurants beginning in 2015. The enactment of similar legislation in other areas where we operate may adversely affect our business. Risks Related to Our TwinSpires BusinessOur mobile and online wagering business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessTwinSpires.com, our mobile and online wagering business, accepts advance deposit wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet. The mobile and online wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing advance deposit wagering vary from state to state. Some states have expressly authorized advance deposit wagering by residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or advance deposit wagering and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited residents of the state from placing wagers through advance deposit wagering hubs located in different states. We believe that a mobile and online wagering business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to advance deposit wagering businesses in other states is not expressly prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions. However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state gaming laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do. In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate advance deposit wagering. Our expansion opportunities with respect to advance deposit wagering may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit advance deposit wagering. Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make advance deposit wagering expressly unlawful, this could have a material adverse impact on our business. Previously existing advance deposit wagering regulations in Illinois expired on December 31, 2012, and we ceased accepting wagers from Illinois residents in January 2013 27until Illinois advance deposit wagering regulations were extended in June 2013. We ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013 due to the enforcement of an existing Texas law prohibiting advance deposit wagering. Regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain. We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our mobile and online wagering business. From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for advance deposit wagering. Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states. Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business. The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies. Such effects could have a material adverse impact to the success of our advance deposit wagering operations. Our mobile and online wagering business faces strong competition and we expect competition levels to increaseOur mobile and online wagering business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses. Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our mobile and online wagering business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other advance deposit wagering businesses. Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do. We anticipate increased competition in our mobile and online business from various other forms of online gaming. Our inability to retain our core customer base or our failure to attract new customers could harm our businessWe utilize technology and marketing relationships to retain current customers and attract new customers. If we are unable to retain our core customer base through robust content offerings and other popular features, if we lose customers to our competitors, or if we fail to attract new customers, our businesses would fail to grow or would be adversely affected. Our mobile and online wagering business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our businessWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting. Laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories. It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these or new laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services which could harm our business. The increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Failure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon geographic location, may result in legal penalties or impairment to our ability to offer our mobile and online wagering products, in generalIndividuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online real money gaming products. While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful. In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal engage our online real money gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online real money gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. Gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations. If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online real money gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online real money gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal"
4,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2017-02-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the CompanyIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and us could materially impact our future performance and results.  The factors described below are the most significant risks that could have a material impact our business.Our business is sensitive to economic conditions which may affect consumer confidence, consumers’ discretionary spending, or our access to credit in a manner that adversely impacts our operations Economic trends can impact consumer confidence and consumers’ discretionary spending.•Negative economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment can impact consumers’ disposable incomes and, therefore, impact the demand for entertainment and leisure activities.  •Declines in the residential real estate market, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  •Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if such decreases occur in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Lower consumer confidence or reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending could result in fewer patrons spending money at our racetracks, gaming and wagering facilities and our online wagering sites and could reduce consumer spending within Big Fish Games.Our access to and cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward economic trends.  Economic trends can also impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase when revenue declines.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time.  From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the gaming industry.  Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  It is not possible to determine the likelihood or extent of any such future changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business.A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersThe integrity of the casual gaming, horseracing, casino gaming and pari-mutuel wagering industries must be perceived as fair to patrons and the public at large.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, the necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business.We depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmedWe believe that our success depends in part on our highly-skilled employee base, and our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization.  If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be impaired which could harm our business.Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate.  This is particularly the case with regard to software developers and engineers, IT staff, and game designers and producers involved in our Big Fish Games line of business.  As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly-skilled employees.  We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.  All of our officers and other employees in the United States are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace.  In our Big Fish Games line of business, the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could 19delay the development and distribution of games and may impair our ability to sell our games and other products and services, harm our reputation and impair our ability to execute our business plans.Our continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the skills and efforts of our senior executives and management team.  We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us, and their retention is affected by the competitiveness of our terms of employment and our ability to compete effectively against other companies.  Certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship, or the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impair our operations.  Our inability to retain key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, take the following actions:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create liens on certain assets;•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and as a result, we may be unable to meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or•require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.If the indebtedness under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.Ownership and development of real estate requires significant expenditures and is subject to risk Our operations require us to own extensive real estate holdings.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including the following: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  Significant expenditures, including property taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property.  Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results.We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of 20cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.Catastrophic events and system failures could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsA disruption or failure in our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  Flooding, blizzards, windstorms, earthquakes or hurricanes could adversely affect our locations.  While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, our coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  We may not be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of natural disasters in the future, or if natural disasters adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our mobile and online wagering, Big Fish Games and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage; however, certain risks still exist.  Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our website and our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  Interruptions in our services or a breach of customers’ secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our site, and could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions also increase the burden on our engineering staff which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our games.  We have property and business interruption insurance covering damage or interruption of our systems; however, this insurance might not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.Although we have ""all risk"" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions.  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements.We may not be able to identify and complete expansion, acquisition or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations.We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects.  New developments or acquisitions may not be completed or integrated successfully.  The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers.  Current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues.  New properties or developments may not be completed or integrated successfully.We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past, and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses, manage the combined operations or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Management of the new business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  The process of integrating new operations may also interrupt the activities 21of those businesses which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include the following:•restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;•non-recurring acquisition costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and•costs of imposing financial and management controls (such as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and operating, administrative and information systems.Although we perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include the following:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;•the risk that the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition;•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third party insurers;•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•the potential loss of key employees or customers;•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The legalization of online real money gaming in the United States and our ability to predict and capitalize on any such legalization may impact our businessNevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted legislation to legalize online real money gaming. In recent years, California, Florida, Mississippi, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C. and the Federal government have considered such legislation. If a large number of additional states or the Federal government enact online real money gaming legislation and we are unable to obtain the necessary licenses to operate online real money gaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in real money gaming could be materially impaired. States or the Federal government may legalize online real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us.  Several states and the Federal government are considering draft laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction on acceptable terms.  In the online real money gaming industry, a significant ""first mover"" advantage exists.  Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online real money gaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors. Failing to do so (""move first"") could materially impair our ability to grow in the online real money gaming space. We may fail to accurately predict when online real money gaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions. The legislative process in each state and at the Federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change. If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online real money gaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online real money gaming offerings in such jurisdictions which could have a material adverse impact on our business.22We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner which may cause customer dissatisfactionCasinos, TwinSpires, and the Big Fish Games segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network; however, we may not be able to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.We may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of othersIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties.  Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future.  We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products.  Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.  However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us.  We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of our products and services if we become subject to litigation relating to intellectual property infringement.We may be unable to adequately protect our own intellectual property rights Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights.  Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property used in our products, including in the areas of advance deposit wagering could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.  Some of our businesses, including our Big Fish Games line of business, are based upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property.  Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented and other technologies and trade secrets that we use to develop and market our games.  Other intellectual property that we create includes audio-visual elements, such as graphics, music and storylines.  We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.  If we are not successful in protecting these rights, the value of our brands and our business could be adversely impacted.Competitors may devise new methods of competing with us which may not be covered by our patents or patent applications.  Our patent applications may not be approved, the patents we have may not adequately protect our intellectual property or ongoing business strategies and our patents may be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable.Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our games and other products and services may be provided.  The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies adequately against unauthorized copying or use which could harm our competitive position.  We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties.  These licensees may take actions that could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity.  To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations.  Any of these events could harm our business.Our business is subject to online security risk, including security breaches, and loss or misuse of our stored information as a result of such a breach, including customers’ personal information, could lead to government enforcement action or other litigation, potential liability, or otherwise harm our businessWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer data.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data.  Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse impact on our business.  23In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement.  The costs of compliance with these types of laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation or changes in law.  Any failure on our part to comply with these types of laws may subject us to significant liabilities.Third parties we work with, such as vendors, may violate applicable laws or our policies, and such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business.  We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under each association’s contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry.  Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code.  If unauthorized disclosure of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code.  This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.  Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks.Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.  We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customersWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (""EFT""), and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks.  Although we place great emphasis on control procedures to protect from chargebacks, these control procedures may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations.Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, other similar laws and regulations, or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, including exposure to complex foreign and U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption laws which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties.  It may be difficult to oversee the conduct of any contractors, third-party partners, representatives or agents who are not our employees, potentially exposing us to greater risk from their actions.  If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face legal proceedings and actions which 24could result in civil penalties, administration actions and criminal sanctions.  Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse impact on our business.We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plansSome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We may experience additional and more successful union activity in the future.Risks Related to Our Racing BusinessWe may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horseracesWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields.  A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horseraces.  Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors, including our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and the overall horse population available for racing.  Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases.  If any of our racetracks is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it could have a material impact on our profitability.  If we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease.We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenue for race purses and capital improvements.  Churchill Downs and Arlington have experienced heightened competition from racinos in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia whose purses are supplemented by gaming revenue.  The opening of the Genting New York Resort at Aqueduct racetrack has enhanced the purse structure at New York racetracks as compared to historical levels.  In Ohio, seven video lottery terminal facilities have opened and in New York, the Rivers Casino & Resort Schenectady opened in February 2017.  Competition from these facilities could harm our ability to attract full fields, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.We depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracksThe Interstate Horseracing Act, or IHA, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the ""Horsemen’s Groups"").  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  The agreements between other racetracks and their Horsemen’s Groups typically provide that those racetracks must receive consent from the Horsemen’s Groups before we can accept wagers on their races.  We may not be able to maintain agreements with, or to obtain required consent from, Horsemen’s Groups.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, our horsemen on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third parties’ races could have a material adverse impact on our business.From time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the ""FHBPA"") which represents horsemen in Florida and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association (""KHBPA"") have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.We also have written agreements with the Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana and Florida.  Florida law requires Calder Casino to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association (the ""FTBOA"") governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to breeders’ stallion and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder before Calder can receive a license to conduct slot machine gaming.25We have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities.  From time to time, we are unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business.Horseracing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationPersonal injuries to jockeys may occur during races or daily workouts.  Although we carry jockey accident insurance at each of our racetracks to cover such injuries, there are certain exclusions to our insurance coverage, and we are still subject to litigation from injured participants.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.  Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as this litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.Our business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator servicesOur customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horseraces.  The failure to keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively, limit our ability to develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product.  A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horseracing.  A totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume.United Tote also has licenses and contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses.  Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner.  Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racingWe conduct our racing business at three thoroughbred racetracks: Churchill Downs, Fair Grounds and Arlington; and, through separate joint ventures and equity investments, at three harness racetracks: Miami Valley, Ocean Downs, and Saratoga Harness.  A significant portion of our racing revenue is generated during the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby week.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs at a time that would affect the Kentucky Oaks or Kentucky Derby, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.Since horseracing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our racing business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseAll of our racetracks face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.All of our racetracks face competition in the simulcast market.  In 2016, approximately 42,000 thoroughbred horse races were conducted in the United States.  We hosted approximately 2,070 races, or about 4.9% of the total.  As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races.  As a racetrack operator, we also compete with other racetracks running live meets at or near the same time as our horse races.  In recent years, this competition has increased as more states have allowed additional, automated gaming activities, such as slot machines at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions.Competition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges for our racing business.  Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, our racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both continued operations and expansion.  Our racing business also faces significantly greater operating costs compared to costs borne by online and web-based gaming companies.  Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-based gaming companies.  These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks.  Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business.26Our racing operations are highly regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur racing business is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized gaming in states where we operate.  Our wagering and racing facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities, including authorities in Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Florida, Ohio, Maryland and New York.  To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to attain, loss of or material change in our racing business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.In addition to licensing requirements, state regulatory authorities can have a significant impact on the operation of our business.  In Illinois, the IRB has the authority to designate racetracks as ""host track"" for the purpose of receiving host track revenue generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races.  Racetracks that are designated as ""host track"" obtain and distribute out of state simulcast signals for the State of Illinois.  Under Illinois law, the ""host track"" is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on the related pari-mutuel wagering.  Should Arlington cease to be a ""host track"" during this period, the loss of hosting revenue could have an adverse impact on our business.  Arlington is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenue monies that are otherwise payable to Arlington’s purse account.  These statutorily or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session, and a reduction or elimination of any of these revenue sources could have an adverse impact on our business.We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.  If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The popularity of horseracing is decliningThere has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives as discussed above.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined 27% from 2007 to 2011 and has been relatively stable since 2011, experiencing less than a 1% decline in growth between 2011 and 2016.  We believe lower interest in racing may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our racing business, as well as our mobile and online wagering business which is dependent on racing content provided by our racing business and other track operators.  A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, or a continued generalized decline in interest in racing, could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our racing business experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in operating results and a decrease in live racing days may adversely impact our businessWe experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to seasonality and other factors.  We have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks, and the number of live racing days varies from year to year.  The number of live racing days may be adversely impacted by factors including inclement weather, our ability to negotiate certain agreements with industry groups (in particular groups working on behalf of horsemen), jockey walkouts and other negotiation issues with independent contractors, and contagious equine disease.  The number of live racing days we are able to offer directly affects our results of operations.  A significant decrease in the number of live racing days and/or live races offered during our Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby week could have a material adverse impact on our business.Risks Related to Our Casino BusinessOur casino business faces significant competition from brick-and-mortar casinos and other gaming and entertainment alternatives, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur casinos operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources.  Our casino operations face competition from Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  Proposed additional casino licenses in Maine and the opening of the Rivers Casino & Resort Schenectady could provide additional competition.  We do not enjoy the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them.  Legislators in Florida continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos.  Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure. Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The gaming industry also faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Web-based interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on web-based activities are clarified.  We anticipate that competition will 27continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry and such increased competition may have an adverse impact on our business.  Our casino business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur casino operations exist at the discretion of the states where we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved.  While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals currently necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals in the future, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations.Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines and loss limits.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business.  The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy.The development of new casino venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos or other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business.The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenue is attributable to slot and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  In recent years, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation. In recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win.  Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.We materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.Our business may be adversely affected by legislation prohibiting tobacco smoking. Legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking in public places has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including in or near jurisdictions in which we operate.  The smoking bans and restrictions have negatively impacted our business in New Orleans, where the New Orleans City Council unanimously approved an ordinance prohibiting smoking in casinos, bars and restaurants beginning in 2015.  The enactment of similar legislation in other areas where we operate may adversely affect our business.Our casino business is geographically concentrated We conduct our casino business at nine principal locations: Oxford, Maine; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Greenville, Mississippi; Miami Gardens, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Lebanon, Ohio; Berlin, Maryland; Black Hawk, Colorado and Saratoga Springs, New York.  We also operate video poker machines throughout Louisiana.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our principal gaming operations, or if economic or regulatory conditions were to become unfavorable in one or more of the regions in which our casino business operates, including a regional decrease in discretionary consumer spending, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.28Risks Related to Our TwinSpires BusinessOur mobile and online wagering business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessTwinSpires.com, our mobile and online wagering business, accepts advance deposit wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet at www.TwinSpires.com.  The mobile and online wagering business is heavily regulated, and laws governing advance deposit wagering vary from state to state.  Some states have expressly authorized advance deposit wagering by residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or advance deposit wagering and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited residents of the state from placing wagers through advance deposit wagering hubs located in different states.  We believe that a mobile and online wagering business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to advance deposit wagering businesses in other states is not expressly prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions.  However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state gaming laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.  In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate advance deposit wagering.Our expansion opportunities with respect to advance deposit wagering may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit advance deposit wagering.  Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make advance deposit wagering expressly unlawful, this could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Previously existing advance deposit wagering regulations in Illinois expired on December 31, 2012, and we ceased accepting wagers from Illinois residents in January 2013 until Illinois advance deposit wagering regulations were extended in June 2013.  We ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013 due to the enforcement of an existing Texas law prohibiting advance deposit wagering.  Regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our mobile and online wagering business.  From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for advance deposit wagering.Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Such effects could have a material adverse impact to the success of our advance deposit wagering operations.Our mobile and online wagering business faces strong competition and we expect competition levels to increaseOur mobile and online wagering business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses.  Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our mobile and online wagering business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other advance deposit wagering businesses.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do.  We anticipate increased competition in our mobile and online business from various other forms of online gaming.During 2011, the United States Department of Justice clarified its position on the Wire Act of 1961 (the ""Wire Act"") which had historically been interpreted to outlaw all forms of gambling across states lines.  The department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the Wire Act applied only to a sporting event or contest, but did not apply to other forms of Internet gambling, including online betting unrelated to sporting events.  The United States Department of Justice indicated that many forms of online gambling could become legal under federal law which could include legalized poker and generalized gaming including state lottery wagering.  We anticipate increased competition to our mobile and online wagering business from various other forms of online gaming.  It is difficult to predict the level of increased competition and the impact of increased competition on our mobile and online wagering business.Our inability to retain our core customer base or our failure to attract new customers could harm our businessWe utilize technology and marketing relationships to retain current customers and attract new customers.  If we are unable to retain our core customer base through robust content offerings and other popular features, if we lose customers to our competitors, or if we fail to attract new customers, our businesses would fail to grow or would be adversely affected.29Our mobile and online wagering business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our businessWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing.  The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting.  Laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories.  It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these or new laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.  This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services which could harm our business.  The increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.Failure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon geographic location, may result in legal penalties or impairment to our ability to offer our mobile and online wagering products, in generalIndividuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online real money gaming products. While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful. In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal engage our online real money gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online real money gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses.  Gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations. If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online real money gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online real money gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal.  Risks Related to Big Fish GamesWe operate in an evolving and highly competitive market segmentThe market segments in which we operate are highly competitive.  The business of developing, distributing and marketing games for PC, Mac and mobile devices is characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging platforms and technologies.  We compete with other game developers and content providers for the leisure time, attention, and discretionary spending of our players based on a number of factors, including game design, brand and consumer reviews, quality of gameplay experience and access to distribution channels.  We also compete with other content providers to acquire rights to game properties developed or licensed by third parties, including with respect to royalty and other economic terms, porting and localization abilities, speed of execution and distribution capabilities and breadth.Many of our primary competitors have greater financial, marketing and other resources dedicated to the development, distribution and promotion of their games.  We are also faced with competition from a vast number of small, independent developers that have access to the same third party platforms as we do to market and distribute titles.The competitive landscape is further complicated by frequent shifts and advancements in free-to-play games for smartphones, tablets and other next-generation platforms.  Free-to-play games are games that players can download and play for free, but that allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee and to engage with various advertisements and in-game offers that generate revenue for us. Our efforts to develop free-to-play games may prove unsuccessful or may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenue because:•free-to-play games have a relatively limited history, and it is unclear how popular this style of game will remain, or its future revenue potential;•free-to-play strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because the games are free and that we will then be able to effectively monetize the games; and•even if our free-to-play games are widely downloaded, a significant portion of the revenue generated from these titles are derived from a relatively small concentration of players and we may fail to retain these or other users, or optimize the monetization of these games.30We derive material revenue from distribution of our titles through third party mobile platforms, and if we are unable to maintain relationships with the owners of these platforms or if our access to these platforms is limited or unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business could be adversely affectedIf we are unable to maintain good relationships with third party mobile platform providers, such as Apple and Google, our business could be impacted.  Our business could be harmed if access to these platforms is limited or suspended based on any change in terms or policies that made the continued distribution of our titles on these platforms unfeasible or less profitable, or that required us to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns or other means to enhance the discoverability of our titles on these platforms.Our ability to transact business through these platforms is subject to our compliance with the standard terms and conditions which may be unilaterally amended at any time.  The owners of these platforms set the revenue share the platform is entitled to receive and may change the revenue share without input from or advance notice to us.  The standard terms and conditions of these platforms may impose restrictions on the types of content the platform will allow to be sold, the ways in which the content is offered and promoted, and the process and timing of accepting content for distribution.  Such restrictions could impair our ability to successfully market and sell our mobile games.  If any of the providers of these platforms determines that we are in violation of their standard terms and conditions, we may be prohibited from distributing our titles through these platforms which could harm our business.We also rely on the ongoing availability of these platforms.  If these platforms experience prolonged periods of unavailability, it could have a material impact on our ability to generate revenue through these platforms and our business could be harmed.  If these platforms fail to provide adequate levels of service, our customers' ability to access our games may be impacted or customers may not receive any virtual items for which they have paid which may adversely affect our brand and consumer goodwill.If we fail to develop and publish mobile games that achieve market acceptance, or continue to enhance our existing games, our revenue may sufferOur business depends on developing and publishing social casino, casual and mid-core free-to-play and premium paid games that consumers will download and spend time and money on consistently.  We continue to invest significant resources in research and development, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and update our existing titles, taking a ""portfolio approach"" this is not dependent on a limited number of ""hit"" titles.  Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing games and other forms of entertainment, and the emergence of new platforms.  If our games do not meet consumer expectations or our games are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business could be adversely impacted.  If we fail to update our games with compelling content or if there is a shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers, our business could be adversely impacted.If we are unable to secure new or ongoing content from third party development partners, our business could be adversely affectedIn addition to the games we develop internally, we acquire or license games, including some of our most successful games, from third party development partners located around the world.  Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented and reliable development partners to source new content and update existing content.  Our agreements with these development partners are in some instances not exclusive to us and will expire at various times.  If we are unable to renew these agreements or if our development partners enter into similar agreements with our competitors or choose to publish their own titles, our business could be harmed.Certain of our development partners are located in geographic regions of the world that continue to experience military and insurgency conflicts, and political turmoil and unrest.  Any of these factors could impact the ability of these development partners to create and deliver content to us in a timely fashion or at all, and could restrict or prohibit our ability to remit payments to these development partners.  If we are unable to deliver compelling content to our customers or update existing content, our ongoing business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.Our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict  Our net revenue, net income, Adjusted EBITDA and other operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly results include:•Changes in the amount of money we spend marketing our games in a particular quarter, including the average amount we pay to acquire new users, as well as changes in the timing of other marketing and advertising expenses within the quarter;31•The popularity and monetization rates of our new mobile games released during the quarter and the ability of games released in prior periods to sustain their popularity and monetization rates;•The number and timing of new mobile games and game updates released by us and our competitors, in particular with respect to those games that may represent a significant portion of revenues in a quarter, which timing can be impacted by internal development delays, shifts in product strategy and how quickly app stores review and approve our games for commercial release;•The seasonality of our industry; and•Changes in accounting rules; such as those governing recognition of revenue, including the period of time over which we recognize revenue for in-app purchases of virtual goods and currency within certain of our mobile games.If our games contain programming errors or flaws, if a significant number of customers experience technical difficulties downloading or launching our games, or if we fail to continue to provide our customers with a high-quality customer experience, it could harm our business and impair our ability to successfully execute our business strategyA critical component of our strategy is providing a high-quality customer experience to our customers.  Our games may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after launch, particularly as we launch new games under tight time constraints.  Porting games to new devices or languages may also result in the creation of errors that did not exist in the game as originally released.  Our customers may experience technical difficulties downloading and launching our games due to the effects of third-party software on their computers that we do not control.  Our customer service team may be unable to resolve these types of technical difficulties, and if a significant number of our customers cannot download or launch our games, it would harm our business.  We believe that if our customers have a negative experience with our games, they may be less inclined to continue or resume playing our games, recommend our games to other potential customers or they may post negative reviews that may dissuade other users from downloading or playing our games.  Undetected programming errors, game defects, data corruption and issues with third-party software can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the game experience of our customers, harm our reputation, cause our customers to stop playing our games and divert our resources, any of which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation or adversely impact our business.""Cheating"" programs, scam offers, black-markets and other actions by third parties that seek to exploit our games and our players may affect our reputation and harm our operating resultsThird parties have developed, and may continue to develop, ""cheating"" programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings that could decrease the revenue we generate from our virtual economies, divert our players from our games or otherwise harm us. Cheating programs enable players to exploit vulnerabilities in our games to obtain virtual currency or other items that would otherwise generate in-app purchases for us, play the games in automated ways or obtain unfair advantages over other players.  Third parties may attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. We devote significant resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if we are unable to do so quickly or effectively, it could damage our reputation and impact our business and results of operations.If the use of smartphones and tablet devices to facilitate game platforms generally does not increase, our business could be adversely affectedWhile the number of people using mobile devices has increased dramatically in the past few years, the mobile gaming market is still emerging and it may not grow as rapidly or robustly as we anticipate.  Our future success is partially dependent upon the continued growth and application of mobile devices for games.  New and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which some of our games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation platforms"
13,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2016-02-24,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the CompanyIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and us could materially impact our future performance and results.  The factors described below are the most significant risks that could have a material impact our business.General economic trends may impact our operationsEconomic conditions improved during 2014 and 2015 in local, regional, national and global markets; however the risk of a future downturn exists.  Our access to and/or cost of credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward trends.  Our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase, when revenue declines.  Any persistence of poor economic conditions, or deterioration in economic conditions, could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our business is sensitive to consumer confidence and reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending which may result from challenging economic conditions, unemployment levels and other changes we cannot predict accuratelyDemand for entertainment and leisure activities is sensitive to consumers’ disposable incomes which can be adversely affected by economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment.  Declines in the residential real estate market, changes in consumer confidence, increases in individual tax rates and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  This could result in fewer patrons visiting our racetracks, gaming and wagering facilities, online wagering sites and our Big Fish Games website, downloading our Big Fish games and/or may impact our customers’ ability to wager with the same frequency and to maintain wagering levels.  Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if it occurs in other markets.  Reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Any significant loss of customers or decline in wagering could have a material adverse impact on our business.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time.  From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of laws affecting the gaming industry.  Many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  It is not possible to determine the likelihood of any such changes in tax laws or fees, or changes in the administration of such laws; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create liens on certain assets;•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.We have pledged and will pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could exercise their rights against the collateral we have granted them.Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under 19our debt facilities or our other indebtness which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or•require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.If the indebtedness under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.We may not be able to identify and complete acquisition, expansion or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations.We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects.  The integration of new operations and any other properties we may acquire or develop will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business.  The process of integrating new properties or projects may also interrupt the activities of those businesses which could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers.  Furthermore, current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues.  We cannot assure that any new properties or developments will be completed or integrated successfully.Management of new properties or business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  We cannot assure that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or developments.We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Furthermore, the costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include:•restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;•non-recurring acquisition costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and•costs of imposing financial and management controls (such as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and operating, administrative and information systems.Although we perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks that include:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;•the risk that, despite the application of our business acumen, the financial performance of the acquired business declines or fails to meet our expectations from and after the date of acquisition;•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third party insurers;•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•the potential loss of key employees or customers;•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and20•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.The legalization of online real money gaming in the United States and our ability to predict and capitalize on any such legalization may impact our businessIn recent years, Delaware, Nevada, California, Florida, Mississippi, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Washington D.C. and the Federal government have considered legislation that would legalize online real money gaming. To date, only Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted such legislation. If a large number of additional states or the Federal government enact online real money gaming legislation and we are unable to obtain the necessary licenses to operate online real money gaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in real money gaming could be materially impaired. In addition, states or the Federal government may legalize online real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us.  Several states and the Federal government are considering draft laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction on acceptable terms.  In the online real money gaming industry, a significant ""first mover"" advantage exists.  Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online real money gaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors. Failing to do so (""move first"") could materially impair our ability to grow in the online real money gaming space. In addition to the risk that online real money gaming will be legalized in a manner unfavorable to us, we may fail to accurately predict when online real money gaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions. The legislative process in each state and at the Federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change. If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online real money gaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online real money gaming offerings in such jurisdictions which could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may adversely infringe on the intellectual property rights of othersIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties.  Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future.  We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products.  Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.  However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us.  We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of our products and services if we become subject to litigation relating to intellectual property infringement.Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights.  Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.  The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation surrounding it has the effect of increasing the risks associated with certain of our product offerings, particularly in the areas of advance deposit wagering, or ADW, and casual gaming.  There can be no assurance that we would not become a party to litigation surrounding our ADW or casual gaming businesses or that such litigation would not cause us to suffer losses or disruption in our business strategy.We are susceptible to unauthorized disclosure of our source codeWe may not be able to protect our computer source code from being copied if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code. We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code.  If unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code.  This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.  Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks.We depend on key personnelOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the skills and efforts of our senior executives and management team.  We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us, and their retention is affected by the competitiveness of our terms of employment and our ability to compete effectively against other companies.  In addition, certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee 21relationship.  Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impair our operations.  Our inability to retain key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business.Catastrophic events and system failures could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsA disruption or failure in our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  Flooding, blizzards, windstorms or hurricanes could adversely affect Churchill Downs, Arlington, Oxford, Harlow’s, Riverwalk, Fair Grounds, Calder, MVG and SCH.  Furthermore, earthquakes may affect our TwinSpires and Big Fish Games locations.  While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, our coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if our operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of natural disasters in the future, or if natural disasters adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons, the disruption could have a material adverse impact on our business.In addition, our ADW, Big Fish Games and brick-and-mortar casino businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage; however, certain risks still exist.  Our systems also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our website and our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  Interruptions in our services or a breach of customers’ secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our site, and could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions also increase the burden on our engineering staff which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our games.  We have property and business interruption insurance covering damage or interruption of our systems.  However, this insurance might not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.Although we have ""all risk"" property insurance coverage for our operating properties which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions.  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements.Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plansSome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future.We receive, process, store and use personal information and other data which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our businessWe receive, process, store and use personal information and other customer data.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data.  Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us which could have an adverse impact on our business.  We receive, store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, contact preferences and payment account information.  We store personal information from ticket sales at our racetracks, from our gaming customers’ rewards accounts and credit lines, from our TwinSpires.com account holders and from 22our Big Fish Games customers.  It is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  While we maintain insurance coverage specific to cyber-insurance matters, any failure on our part to maintain adequate safeguards may subject us to significant liabilities.  Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse impact on our business.  We are also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, we could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  If we fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, we could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation.  Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.Our business is subject to online security risk, including security breachesWe store and transmit users' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability.  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and be exposed to litigation or potential liability.  Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry.  Many companies, including ours, have been the targets of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.We carry insurance covering many of these risks, including network security, first party extortion threats and business interruptions, but there are certain exclusions to this coverage and the insurance limits may not be sufficient to fully mitigate all financial damage to us.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner which may cause customer dissatisfactionCasinos, TwinSpires, and the Big Fish Games segments are characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards which could have adverse effects on our business due to chargebacks from customersWe allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (""EFT""), and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange 23and other fees which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit or debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse online gaming losses through chargebacks.  Although we place great emphasis on control procedures to protect from chargebacks, these control procedures may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations.Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the ""FCPA"") which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Any violation of FCPA regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business.We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material adverse impact on our business.A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersThe integrity of the casual gaming, horseracing, casino gaming and pari-mutuel wagering industries must be perceived as fair to patrons and the public at large.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, the necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could have a material adverse impact on our business.Risks Related to Our Racing BusinessOur racing operations are highly regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur racing business is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized gaming in states where we operate.  Our wagering and racing facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities, including authorities in Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Florida, Ohio and New York.  To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to attain, loss of or material change in our racing business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct, and could have a material adverse impact on our business.In addition to licensing requirements, state regulatory authorities can have a significant impact on the operation of our business.  In Illinois, the IRB has the authority to designate racetracks as ""host track"" for the purpose of receiving host track revenue generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races.  Racetracks that are designated as ""host track"" obtain and distribute out of state simulcast signals for the State of Illinois.  Under Illinois law, the ""host track"" is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on the related pari-mutuel wagering.  Should Arlington cease to be a ""host track"" during this period, the loss of hosting revenue could have an adverse impact on our business.  In addition, Arlington is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenue monies that are otherwise payable to Arlington’s purse account.  These statutorily or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session, and their reduction or elimination could have an adverse impact on our business.We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.  If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.Economic trends specific to the horseracing industry are unfavorableHorseracing and related activities, as well as the gaming services we provide, are similar to other leisure activities in that these activities represent discretionary expenditures likely to decline during economic downturns.  In some cases, even the perception of an impending economic downturn or the continuation of a recessionary climate can be enough to discourage consumers from spending on leisure activities.  These economic trends can impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  We will continue to closely monitor participants’ operational viability within the 24industry and any related collection issues which could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business.Our racing business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseAll of our racetracks face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.All of our racetracks face competition in the simulcast market.  In 2015, approximately 39,840 thoroughbred horse races were conducted in the United States.  We hosted approximately 2,120 races, or about 5.3% of the total.  As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races.  As a racetrack operator, we also compete with other racetracks running live meets at or near the same time as our horse races.  In recent years, this competition has increased as more states have allowed additional, automated gaming activities, such as slot machines at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions.Competition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges for our racing business.  Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, our racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both continued operations and expansion.  Our racing business also faces significantly greater costs in operating our racing business compared to costs borne by these gaming companies.  Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-based gaming companies.  These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks.  Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material adverse impact on our business.The popularity of horseracing is decliningThere has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives as discussed above.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined 27% from 2007 to 2011 and has been relatively stable since 2011, experiencing less than a 1% decline in growth between 2011 and 2015.  We believe lower interest in racing may have a negative impact on revenue and profitability in our racing business, as well as our ADW business which is dependent on racing content provided by our racing business and other track operators.  A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, or a continued generalized decline in interest in racing, could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our racing business is geographically concentrated and experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in operating resultsWe experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to seasonality and other factors.  We have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks, and the number of live racing days varies from year to year.  The number of live racing days we are able to offer directly affects our results of operations.  A significant decrease in the number of live racing days and/or live races offered during our Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby week could have a material adverse impact on our business.We may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horseracesWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields.  A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horseraces.  Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors. It depends on our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and it also depends on the overall horse population available for racing.  Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases such as the neurologic form of Equine Herpes Virus-I and Strangles.  If any of our racetracks is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it could have a material impact on our profitability.  If we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease.We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenue for race purses and capital improvements.  Churchill Downs and Arlington have experienced heightened competition from racinos in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia whose purses are supplemented by gaming revenue.  The opening of the Genting New York Resort at Aqueduct racetrack has enhanced the purse structure at New York racetracks as compared to historical levels.  In Ohio, seven video lottery terminal facilities have opened.  Our failure to attract full fields could have a material adverse impact on our business.Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racingWe conduct our racing business at three thoroughbred racetracks: Churchill Downs, Fair Grounds and Arlington; and, through separate joint ventures and equity investments, at two harness racetracks: MVG and SCH.  A significant portion of our racing 25revenue is generated by two events, the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs at a time that would affect the Kentucky Oaks or Kentucky Derby, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.Since horseracing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, heavy rains, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.We depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracksThe IHA, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the ""Horsemen’s Groups"").  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  The agreements between other racetracks and their Horsemen’s Groups typically provide that those racetracks must receive consent from the Horsemen’s Groups before we can accept wagers on their races.  From time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the ""FHBPA"") which represents horsemen in Florida and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association (""KHBPA"") have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  The IHA and various state laws require that we have written agreements with Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks in order to simulcast races on an export basis.  Our simulcasting agreements are generally subject to the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material adverse impact on our business.We also have written agreements with the Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana and Florida.  Florida law requires Calder Casino to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association (the ""FTBOA"") governing the contribution of a portion of revenue from slot machine gaming to breeders’ stallion and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted by TSG at Calder before Calder can receive a license to conduct slot machine gaming.It is not certain that we will be able to maintain agreements with, or to obtain required consent from, Horsemen’s Groups.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, our horsemen on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third parties’ races could have a material adverse impact on our business.In addition, we have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities.  From time to time, we are unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material adverse impact on our business.Horseracing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationAlthough we carry jockey accident insurance at each of our racetracks to cover personal jockey injuries which may occur during races or daily workouts, there are certain exclusions to our insurance coverage, and we are still subject to litigation from injured participants.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.  Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as this litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.Ownership and development of real estate requires significant expenditures and is subject to riskOur racing operations require us to own extensive real estate holdings.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  The real estate industry is also capital intensive and sensitive to interest rates.  Significant expenditures, including property taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property.  Such expenditures may negatively impact our operating results.26We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.Our business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator servicesOur customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horseraces.  The failure to keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively, limit our ability to develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product.  A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horseracing.  A totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume.United Tote also has licenses and contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses.  Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner.  Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Risks Related to Our Casino BusinessOur casino business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur casino operations exist at the discretion of the states where we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved.  While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to continue to operate or to expand our gaming operations.Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines and loss limits.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business.  The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy.Our casino business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur casino operations operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources.  The gaming industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Our casino operations also face competition from Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  We do not enjoy the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them.  Web-based interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on web-based activities are clarified.  We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry.  In addition, Florida legislators continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos.  Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure. Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.Our casino business is geographically concentratedWe conduct our casino business at seven principal locations: Oxford, Maine; Vicksburg, Mississippi; Greenville, Mississippi; Miami Gardens, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Lebanon, Ohio and Saratoga Springs, New York.  We also operate video poker machines throughout Louisiana.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our principal gaming operations, or if economic or regulatory conditions were to become unfavorable in one or more of the regions in which our casino business operates, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.27The development of new casino venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesWe may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos or other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets which could have a material adverse impact on our business.The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenue is attributable to slot and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  In recent years, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation. In recent years, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win.  Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.We materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.Risks Related to Our TwinSpires BusinessOur ADW business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessTwinSpires.com, our ADW business, accepts advance deposit wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet at www.TwinSpires.com.  The ADW business is heavily regulated, and laws governing advance deposit wagering vary from state to state.  Some states have expressly authorized advance deposit wagering by residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or advance deposit wagering and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited residents of the state from placing wagers through advance deposit wagering hubs located in different states.  We believe that an ADW business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to ADW businesses in other states is not expressly prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions.  However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state gaming laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.  In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate advance deposit wagering.Our expansion opportunities with respect to advance deposit wagering may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit advance deposit wagering.  Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make advance deposit wagering expressly unlawful, this could have a material adverse impact on our business.  Previously existing ADW regulations in Illinois expired on December 31, 2012, and we ceased accepting wagers from Illinois residents in January 2013 until Illinois ADW regulations were extended in June 2013.  We ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013 due to the enforcement of an existing Texas law prohibiting ADW wagering.  Regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our ADW business.  From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for advance deposit wagering.Many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Such effects could have a material adverse impact to the success of our advance deposit wagering operations.28Our ADW business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our businessWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing.  The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting.  Laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories.  It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.  This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services which could harm our business.  The increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust.  The growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices.  We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation.  If that were to occur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs.  Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of online gaming and impair our business.Failure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon geographic location, may result in legal penalties or impairment to our ability to offer our ADW products, in generalIndividuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online real money gaming products. While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful. In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal engage our online real money gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online real money gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses.  Gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations. If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online real money gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online real money gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal.  Our inability to restrict illegal access could materially impact our other gaming licenses as well.Our inability to retain our core customer base or our failure to attract new customers could harm our businessWe utilize technology and marketing relationships to retain current customers and attract new customers.  If we are unable to retain our core customer base through robust content offerings and other popular features, if we lose customers to our competitors, or if we fail to attract new customers, our businesses would fail to grow or would be adversely affected.Our ADW business faces strong competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur ADW business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses.  Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our ADW business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other ADW businesses.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do.  We anticipate increased competition in our ADW business from various other forms of online gaming.During 2011, the United States Department of Justice clarified its position on the Wire Act of 1961 (the ""Wire Act"") which had historically been interpreted to outlaw all forms of gambling across states lines.  The department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the Wire Act applied only to a sporting event or contest, but did not apply to other forms of Internet gambling, including online betting unrelated to sporting events.  The United States Department of Justice indicated that many forms of online gambling could become legal under federal law which could include legalized poker and generalized gaming including state lottery wagering.  We anticipate increased competition to our ADW business from various other forms of online gaming.  It is difficult to predict the level of increased competition and the impact of increased competition on our ADW business. 29Risks Related to Big Fish GamesWe operate in an evolving and highly competitive market segmentThe market segments in which we operate are highly competitive.  The business of developing, distributing and marketing games for PC, Mac and mobile devices is characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging platforms and technologies.  We compete with other game developers and content providers for the leisure time, attention, and discretionary spending of our players based on a number of factors, including game design, brand and consumer reviews, quality of gameplay experience and access to distribution channels.  We also compete with other content providers to acquire rights to game properties developed or licensed by third parties, including with respect to royalty and other economic terms, porting and localization abilities, speed of execution and distribution capabilities and breadth.Many of our primary competitors have greater financial, marketing and other resources dedicated to the development, distribution and promotion of their games.  In addition, given the open nature of the development process and relatively low barriers to entry, we are also faced with competition from a vast number of small, independent developers that have access to the same third party platforms as we do to market and distribute their titles.The competitive landscape is further complicated by frequent shifts and advancements in free-to-play games for smartphones, tablets and other next-generation platforms.  Free-to-play games are games that players can download and play for free, but that allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee and to engage with various advertisements and in-game offers that generate revenue for us. Our efforts to develop free-to-play games may prove unsuccessful or may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenue because:•free-to-play games have a relatively limited history, and it is unclear how popular this style of game will remain, or its future revenue potential;•free-to-play strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because the games are free and that we will then be able to effectively monetize the games; and•even if our free-to-play games are widely downloaded, a significant portion of the revenue generated from these titles are derived from a relatively small concentration of players and we may fail to retain these or other users, or optimize the monetization of these games.We derive material revenue from distribution of our titles through third party mobile platforms, and if we are unable to maintain relationships with the owners of these platforms or if our access to these platforms is limited or unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business could be adversely affectedIf we are unable to maintain good relationships with third party mobile platform providers, such as Apple and Google, our business could be impacted.  Our business could be harmed if access to these platforms is limited or suspended based on any change in terms or policies that made the continued distribution of our titles on these platforms unfeasible or less profitable, or that required us to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns or other means to enhance the discoverability of our titles on these platforms.Our ability to transact business through these platforms is subject to our compliance with the standard terms and conditions which may be unilaterally amended at any time.  The owners of these platforms set the revenue share the platform is entitled to receive and may change the revenue share without input from or advance notice to us.  The standard terms and conditions of these platforms may impose restrictions on the types of content the platform will allow to be sold, the ways in which the content is offered and promoted, and the process and timing of accepting content for distribution.  Such restrictions could impair our ability to successfully market and sell our mobile games.  If any of the providers of these platforms determines that we are in violation of their standard terms and conditions, we may be prohibited from distributing our titles through these platforms which could harm our business.We also rely on the ongoing availability of these platforms.  If these platforms experience prolonged periods of unavailability, it could have a material impact on our ability to generate revenue through these platforms and our business could be harmed.  If these platforms fail to provide adequate levels of service, our customers' ability to access our games may be impacted or customers may not receive any virtual items for which they have paid which may adversely affect our brand and consumer goodwill.Our financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predictOur bookings, revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly results include: 30•Changes in the amount of money we spend marketing our games in a particular quarter, including the average amount we pay to acquire new users, as well as changes in the timing of other marketing and advertising expenses within the quarter;•The popularity and monetization rates of our new mobile games released during the quarter and the ability of games released in prior periods to sustain their popularity and monetization rates;•The number and timing of new mobile games and game updates released by us and our competitors, in particular with respect to those games that may represent a significant portion of revenues in a quarter, which timing can be impacted by internal development delays, shifts in product strategy and how quickly app stores review and approve our games for commercial release;•The seasonality of our industry; and•Changes in accounting rules; such as those governing recognition of revenue, including the period of time over which we recognize revenue for in-app purchases of virtual goods and currency within certain of our mobile games.If we fail to develop and publish mobile games that achieve market acceptance, or continue to enhance our existing games, our revenue may sufferOur business depends on developing and publishing social casino, casual and mid-core free-to-play and premium paid games that consumers will download and spend time and money on consistently.  We continue to invest significant resources in research and development, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and update our existing titles, taking a ""portfolio approach"" this is not dependent on a limited number of ""hit"" titles.  Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing games and other forms of entertainment, and the emergence of new platforms.  If our games do not meet consumer expectations or our games are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business could be adversely impacted.  If we fail to update our games with compelling content or if there is a shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers, our business could be adversely impacted.If the use of smartphones and tablet devices to facilitate game platforms generally does not increase, our business could be adversely affectedWhile the number of people using mobile devices has increased dramatically in the past few years, the mobile gaming market is still emerging and it may not grow as rapidly or robustly as we anticipate.  Our future success is partially dependent upon the continued growth and application of mobile devices for games.  New and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which some of our games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation platforms.If we are unable to secure new or ongoing content from third party development partners on favorable terms, or at all, our business could be adversely affectedIn addition to the games we develop internally, we acquire or license games, including some of our most successful games, from third party development partners located around the world.  Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented and reliable development partners to source new content and update existing content.  Our agreements with these development partners are in some instances not exclusive to us and will expire at various times.  If we are unable to renew these agreements on terms favorable to us or at all, or if our development partners enter into similar agreements with our competitors or choose to publish their own titles, our business could be harmed.In addition, certain of our development partners are located in geographic regions of the world that continue to experience military and insurgency conflicts, and political turmoil and unrest.  Any of these factors could impact the ability of these development partners to create and deliver content to us in a timely fashion or at all, and could restrict or prohibit our ability to remit payments to these development partners.  If we are unable to deliver compelling content to our customers or update existing content, our ongoing business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.If our games contain programming errors or flaws, if a significant number of customers experience technical difficulties downloading or launching our games, or if we fail to continue to provide our customers with a high-quality customer experience, it could harm our business and impair our ability to successfully execute our business strategyA critical component of our strategy is providing a high-quality customer experience to our customers.  Our games may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after launch, particularly as we launch new games under tight time constraints.  Porting games to new devices or languages may also result in the creation of errors that did not exist in the game as originally released.  Our customers may experience technical difficulties downloading and launching our games due to the effects of third-party software on their computers that we do not control.  We cannot provide assurances that our customer service team can resolve these types of technical difficulties, and if a significant number of our customers cannot download or launch our games, it would harm our business.  We believe that if our customers have a negative experience with our games, they may be less inclined to continue or resume playing our games, recommend our games to other potential 31customers or they may post negative reviews that may dissuade other users from downloading or playing our games.  Undetected programming errors, game defects, data corruption and issues with third-party software can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the game experience of our customers, harm our reputation, cause our customers to stop playing our games and divert our resources, any of which could result in legal liability to us, harm our reputation or adversely impact our business.We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and our businessOur business is based upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property.  Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented and other technologies and trade secrets that we use to develop and market our games.  Other intellectual property that we create includes audio-visual elements, such as graphics, music and storylines.  We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.  If we are not successful in protecting these rights, the value of our brands and our business could be adversely impacted.While we believe that our patents or pending patent applications help to protect our business, we cannot be certain that our products, services or operations do not, or will not, infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties, or that competitors will not devise new methods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications.  Our patent applications may not be approved, the patents we have may not adequately protect our intellectual property or ongoing business strategies and our patents may be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable.  We rely on intellectual property and technology developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our games and other products and services may be provided.  The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies adequately against unauthorized copying or use which could harm our competitive position.  We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties.  These licensees may take actions that could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity.  To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations.  Any of these events could harm our business.We depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmedWe believe that our success depends in part on our highly-skilled employee base, and our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization.  This includes software developers and engineers, IT staff, game designers and producers, marketing specialists, analytics professionals, and customer service staff.  If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be impaired which could harm our business.Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate.  As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly-skilled employees.  We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.All of our officers and other employees in the United States are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace.  In addition, the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could delay the development and distribution of games and may impair our ability to sell our games and other products and services, harm our reputation and impair our ability to execute our business plans.""Cheating"" programs, scam offers, black-markets and other actions by third parties that seek to exploit our games and our players may affect our reputation and harm our operating resultsThird parties have developed, and may continue to develop, ""cheating"" programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings that could decrease the revenue we generate from our virtual economies, divert our players from our games or otherwise harm us. Cheating programs enable players to exploit vulnerabilities in our games to obtain virtual currency or other items that would otherwise generate in-app purchases for us, play the games in automated ways or obtain unfair advantages over other players.  In addition, third parties may attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. We devote significant resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if we are unable to do so quickly or effectively, it could damage our reputation and impact our business and results of operations.32"
16,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2015-02-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the CompanyIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and Company could materially impact our future performance and results.  The factors described below are the most significant risks that could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.General economic trends may impact our operationsEconomic conditions improved during 2013 and 2014 from a previous period of adverse conditions in local, regional, national and global markets, however there remains risk that a downturn may resume.  Our access to, or cost of, credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward trends.  Additionally, our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase, when revenues decline.  Accordingly, any persistence of poor economic conditions, or further deterioration, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business is sensitive to consumer confidence and reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending, which may result from the challenging economic conditions, unemployment levels and other changes we cannot accurately predictDemand for entertainment and leisure activities is sensitive to consumers’ disposable incomes, which have been adversely affected by recent economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment.  Further declines in the residential real estate market, changes in consumer confidence, increases in individual tax rates, and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  This could result in fewer patrons visiting our racetracks, gaming and wagering facilities, online wagering sites and our casual gaming site, or downloading our casual games, and/or may impact our customers’ ability to wager with the same frequency and maintain their wagering level profiles.  Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if it occurs in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Accordingly, any significant loss of customers or decline in wagering could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time.  From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry.  Moreover, many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of any such changes in tax laws or fee increases, or their administration; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:24•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create liens on certain assets;•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.We have pledged and will pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could proceed against the collateral we have granted them.Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facilities or the existing agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or•require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.If the indebtedness under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.We may not be able to identify and complete acquisition, expansion or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations.We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects.  The integration of new operations and any other properties we may acquire or develop will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business.  The process of integrating new properties or projects may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers.  Furthermore, current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues.  We cannot assure that any new properties or developments will be completed or integrated successfully.Management of new properties or business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  We cannot assure that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or developments.We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses, including our recent acquisitions of Big Fish Games and Oxford, into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Furthermore, the costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include:•restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;•non-recurring acquisition costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and25•costs of imposing financial and management controls (such as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and operating, administrative and information systems.Although we perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks which include:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third party insurers;•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•the potential loss of key employees or customers;•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines, which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business strategy is premised, in part, on the legalization of online real money gaming in the United States and our ability to predict and capitalize on any such legalization In the last few years, Delaware, Nevada, California, Florida, Mississippi, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Washington D.C. and the Federal government have considered legislation that would legalize online real money gaming. To date, only Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted such legislation. If a large number of additional states or the Federal government enact online real money gaming legislation and we are unable to obtain the necessary licenses to operate online real money gaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth in real money gaming could be materially impaired. In addition, states or the Federal government may legalize online real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us. For example, several states and the Federal government are considering draft laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada and New Jersey, state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction. There also exists in the online real money gaming industry a significant “first mover” advantage. Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online real money gaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors. Failing to do so (“move first”) could materially impair our ability to grow in the online real money gaming space. In addition to the risk that online real money gaming will be legalized in a manner unfavorable to us, we may fail to accurately predict when online real money gaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions. The legislative process in each state and at the Federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change. If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online real money gaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online real money gaming offerings in such jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Failure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon their geographic location, may result in legal penalties or an impairment to our ability to offer online real money gaming, in general Individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online real money gaming products. While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful. In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal engage our online real money gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online real money gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us, and therefore our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. For example, gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations. If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online real money gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online real money gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal. Furthermore, our inability to restrict illegal access could materially impact our other gaming licenses as well.26We may adversely infringe on the intellectual property rights of othersIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties.  Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future.  We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products.  Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.  However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all.  We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of our products and services if we become subject to litigation relating to intellectual property infringement.Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights.  Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.  The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation surrounding it has the effect of increasing the risks associated with certain of our product offerings, particularly in the areas of advance deposit wagering, or ADW, and casual gaming.  There can be no assurance that we would not become a party to litigation surrounding our ADW or casual gaming businesses or that such litigation would not cause us to suffer losses or disruption in our business strategy.We are susceptible to unauthorized disclosure of our source codeWe may not be able to protect our computer source code from being copied if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code. We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code.  If unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code.  This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality; which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.  Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks.We depend on key personnelOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the skills and efforts of our senior executives and management team including Robert L. Evans, our Chairman of the Board, and William C. Carstanjen, our Chief Executive Officer.  We cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us, and their retention is affected by the competitiveness of our terms of employment and our ability to compete effectively against other companies.  In addition, certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship.  Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impair our operations.  Our inability to retain key personnel could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Catastrophic events could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsA disruption or failure in our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  For example, Churchill Downs, Harlow’s, Riverwalk, Fair Grounds and its related OTBs and Calder could all be adversely affected by flooding or hurricanes.  Furthermore, our TwinSpires and Big Fish Games locations may be affected by earthquakes.  While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, our coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of natural disasters in the future, or if natural disasters adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons, the disruption could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions.  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.27Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements.Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plansSome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future.We process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our businessWe receive, store and process personal information and other customer data.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data.  Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.  While the Company maintains insurance coverage specific to cyber-insurance matters, any failure on our part to maintain adequate safeguards may subject us to significant liabilities.  Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.  The Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation.  Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm to our reputationWe store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, contact preferences and payment account information.  For example, we store personal information from TwinSpires.com account holders, from our gaming customers’ rewards accounts and from ticket sales at our racetracks.  It is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.Our business is subject to online security risk, including security breachesWe store and transmit users' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability.  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and be exposed to litigation or potential liability for us.  Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security. System failures or damage from earthquakes, fires, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attack or other unforeseen events could harm our businessOur ADW and casual gaming businesses depend upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage; however, certain risks still exist.  Thus, our systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our website 28and our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  Interruptions in our services or a breach of customers’ secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our site, and could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our websites and in our games.  We have property and business interruption insurance covering damage or interruption of our systems.  However, this insurance might not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.Security breaches, computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operationsSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry.  Many companies, including ours, have been the target of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.We carry insurance covering many of these risks, including network security, first party extortion threats and business interruptions, but there are certain exclusions to this coverage and the insurance limits may not be sufficient to fully mitigate all financial damage to the Company.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionThe gaming sector is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, which could have adverse effects on our business or results of operations due to chargebacks from customers We allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (“EFT”), and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit, debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse their online gaming losses through chargebacks. Although we place great emphasis on control procedures to protect from chargebacks, these control procedures may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations.Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Any violation of FCPA regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.29A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersThe integrity of the horseracing, gaming and pari-mutuel wagering industries must be perceived as fair to patrons and the public at large.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, the necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could significantly lower attendance, amounts wagered and reduce revenues.Risks Related to Our Racing BusinessOur racing operations are highly regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur racing business is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized gaming in states where we operate.  Our wagering and racing facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities, including authorities in Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana and Florida.  To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to attain, loss of or material change in our racing business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to licensing requirements, state regulatory authorities can have a significant impact on the operation of our business.  For example, in Illinois the IRB has the authority to designate racetracks as “host track” for the purpose of receiving host track revenues generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races.  Racetracks that are designated as “host track” obtain and distribute out of state simulcast signals for the State of Illinois.  Under Illinois law, the “host track” is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on the related pari-mutuel wagering.  Should Arlington cease to be a “host track” during this period, the loss of hosting revenues could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, Arlington is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenues monies that are otherwise payable to Arlington’s purse account.  These statutorily or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session, and their reduction or elimination could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.  If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Economic trends specific to the horse racing industry are unfavorableHorseracing and related activities, as well as the gaming services we provide, are similar to other leisure activities in that they represent discretionary expenditures likely to decline during economic downturns.  In some cases, even the perception of an impending economic downturn or the continuation of a recessionary climate can be enough to discourage consumers from spending on leisure activities.  These economic trends can impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  For example, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $1.1 million of bad debt expense, net of purses, resulting from the bankruptcy filing of New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation.  We will continue to closely monitor participants’ operational viability within the industry and any related collection issues which could potentially have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our racing business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseAll of our racetracks face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and we expect the number of competitors to increase.  See subheading “K. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of racing industry competition.All of our racetracks face competition in the simulcast market.  Approximately 41,280 thoroughbred horse races are conducted annually in the United States.  Of these races, we host approximately 3,030 races each year, or about 7.3% of the total.  As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races.  As a racetrack operator, we also compete with other racetracks running live meets at or near the same time as our horse races.  In recent years, this competition has increased as more states have allowed additional, automated gaming activities, such as slot machines, at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions.Competition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges for our racing business.  Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, our racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both their continued operations and expansion.  Our racing business also faces significantly greater costs in operating our racing business compared to costs borne by these gaming companies.  Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-30based gaming companies.  Many online and web-based gaming companies are based off-shore and avoid regulation under U.S. state and federal laws.  These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks.  Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The popularity of horse racing is decliningThere has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives as discussed above.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined 27% from 2007 to 2011 and has been relatively stable since experiencing a cumulative decline of approximately 2% between 2011 and 2014.  We believe lower interest in racing may have a negative impact on revenues and profitability in our racing business, as well as our ADW business, which is dependent on racing content provided by our racing business and other track operators.  Our business plan anticipates that we will attract new customers to our racetracks, OTBs and ADW operations.  A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, or a continued generalized decline in interest in racing, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our racing business is geographically concentrated and experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in operating resultsWe conduct our racing business at three racetracks: Churchill Downs, Fair Grounds and Arlington.  A significant portion of our racing revenues are generated by two events, the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs at a time that would affect the Kentucky Derby or Kentucky Oaks, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to seasonality and other factors.  We have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks, and the number of live racing days varies from year to year.  The number of live racing days we are able to offer directly affects our results of operations.  A significant decrease in the number of live racing days and/or live races offered during our Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks week could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horseracesWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields.  A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horseraces.  Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors. It depends on our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and it also depends on the overall horse population available for racing.  Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases such as the neurologic form of Equine Herpes Virus-I and Strangles.  If any of our racetracks is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it would have a material impact on our profitability.  Finally, if we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease.We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenues for race purses and capital improvements.  For example, Churchill Downs and Arlington are experiencing heightened competition from racinos in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia whose purses are supplemented by gaming revenues.  The opening of the Genting New York Resort at Aqueduct racetrack has enhanced the purse structure at New York racetracks as compared to historical levels.  Ohio has authorized four land-based casinos by voter referendum and video lottery terminals at seven Ohio racetracks through executive order.  Our failure to attract full fields could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racingSince horseracing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracks31The IHA, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the “Horsemen’s Groups”).  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  In addition, the agreements between other racetracks and their Horsemen’s Groups typically provide that those racetracks must receive consent from the Horsemen’s Groups before we can accept wagers on their races.  For example, from time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the “FHBPA”) which represents horsemen in Florida and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association (“KHBPA”) have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Further, the IHA and various state laws require that we have written agreements with Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks in order to simulcast races on an export basis.  In addition, our simulcasting agreements are generally subject to the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We also have written agreements with the Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana and Florida.  Florida law requires Calder Casino to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenues from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association (the “FTBOA”) governing the contribution of a portion of revenues from slot machines gaming to breeders’, stallion, and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted at Calder before Calder can receive a license to conduct slot machine gaming.It is not certain that we will be able to maintain agreements with, or to obtain required consent from, Horsemen’s Groups.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, our horsemen on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third parties’ races could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities.  From time to time, we are unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationAlthough we carry jockey accident insurance at each of our racetracks to cover personal jockey injuries which may occur during races or daily workouts, there are certain exclusions to our insurance coverage, and we are still subject to litigation from injured participants.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.  Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as this litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.Ownership and development of real estate requires significant expenditures and is subject to riskOur racing operations require us to own extensive real estate holdings.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  The real estate industry is also capital intensive and sensitive to interest rates.  Further, significant expenditures, including property taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property, which expenditures negatively impact our operating results.In addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.Our business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator servicesOur customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horseraces.  The failure to 32keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively, limit our ability to develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product.  A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horseracing.  In addition, a totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume.United Tote also has licenses and contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses.  Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner.  Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Casino BusinessOur gaming business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur gaming operations exist at the discretion of the states where we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved.  While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to continue to operate or to expand our gaming operations.Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines and loss limits.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy.Our gaming business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur gaming operations operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources.  The gaming industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Our gaming operations also face competition from Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  We do not enjoy the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them.  Additionally, web-based interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on web-based activities are clarified.  We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry.  In addition, Florida legislators continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos.  Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure. Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  See subheading “K. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of gaming industry competition.Our gaming business is geographically concentratedWe conduct our gaming business at six principal locations: Oxford in Oxford, Maine, Riverwalk in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Harlow’s in Greenville, Mississippi, Calder Casino in Miami Gardens, Florida, Fair Grounds Slots in New Orleans, Louisiana, and at our joint venture, Miami Valley Gaming and Racing in Lebanon, Ohio.  We also operate video poker machines throughout Louisiana through our subsidiary, VSI.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our principal gaming operations, or if economic or regulatory conditions were to become unfavorable in one or more of the regions in which they operate, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The development of new gaming venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesThe Company may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos or other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.33The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenues are attributable to slot and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  In recent years, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation. In recent years, for example, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win.  Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.We materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.Risks Related to Our TwinSpires BusinessOur ADW business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessTwinSpires, our ADW business, accepts advance deposit wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet at TwinSpires.com.  The ADW business is heavily regulated, and laws governing advance deposit wagering vary from state to state.  Some states have expressly authorized advance deposit wagering by their own residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or advance deposit wagering and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited their residents from placing wagers through advance deposit wagering hubs located in different states.  We believe that an ADW business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to ADW businesses in other states is not expressly prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions.  However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state gaming laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.  In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate advance deposit wagering.Our expansion opportunities with respect to advance deposit wagering may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit advance deposit wagering.  Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make advance deposit wagering expressly unlawful, this could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For example, previously existing ADW regulations in Illinois expired on December 31, 2012, and we ceased accepting wagers from Illinois residents in January 2013 until June 2013, when Illinois ADW regulations were extended.  Furthermore, we ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013, due to the enforcement of an existing Texas law prohibiting ADW wagering.  In addition, the regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our ADW business.  From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for advance deposit wagering.Furthermore, many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations, which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Such effects could have a material, adverse impact to the success of our advance deposit wagering operations.Our ADW business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our businessWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing.  The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting.  For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online 34services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories.  It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.  This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust.  Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices.  We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation.  If that were to occur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs.  Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of online gaming and impair our business.Our ADW business faces strong competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur ADW business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses.  Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our ADW business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other ADW businesses.  In addition, we face competition from a new wagering product called exchange wagering, a variation of pari-mutuel wagering in which bettors wager directly against one another, establishing their own odds on a horserace.  Both California and New Jersey legislatures have approved exchange wagering.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do.  In addition, we believe that new competitors may enter the ADW business with relative ease because of the low cost of entry.  As a result, we anticipate increased competition in our ADW business.  It is difficult to predict the impact of increased competition on our ADW business.  See subheading “K. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of ADW industry competition.A clarification on the impact of the Federal Wire Act of 1961 on Internet gaming could increase competitionDuring 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice clarified its position on the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”), which had historically been interpreted to outlaw all forms of gambling across states lines.  The department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the Wire Act applied only to a sporting event or contest, but did not apply to other forms of Internet gambling, including online betting unrelated to sporting events.  The Justice Department indicated that many forms of online gambling could become legal under federal law, which could include legalized poker and generalized gaming including state lottery wagering.  As a result, we anticipate increased competition to our ADW business from various other forms of online gaming.  It is difficult to predict the level of increased competition and the impact of increased competition on our ADW business.Our inability to retain our core customer base or our failure to attract new customers could harm our businessWe utilize technology and marketing relationships to retain current customers and attract new customers.  If we are unable to retain our core customer base through robust content offerings and other popular features, if we lose customers to our competitors, or if we fail to attract new customers, our businesses would fail to grow or would be adversely affected.Risks Related to Big Fish GamesWe operate in an evolving and highly competitive market segmentThe market segments in which we operate are highly competitive and the barriers to entry are low.  The business of developing, distributing and marketing downloadable and mobile games is characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging platforms and technologies.  We compete with other game developers and content providers for the leisure time, attention, and discretionary spending of our players based on a number of factors, including game design, brand and consumer reviews, quality of gameplay experience and access to distribution channels.  We also compete with other content providers to acquire rights to game properties developed or licensed by third parties, including with respect to royalty and other economic terms, porting and localization abilities, speed of execution and distribution capabilities and breadth.Many of our primary competitors have dedicated greater financial, marketing and other resources to the development, distribution and promotion of their games.  In addition, given the open nature of the development process and relatively low barriers to entry, 35we are also faced with competition from a vast number of small, independent developers that have access to the same third party platforms as we do to market and distribute their titles.The competitive landscape is further complicated by frequent shifts and advancements in free-to-play games for smartphones, tablets and other next-generation platforms.  Free-to-play games are games that a player can download and play for free, but which allow players to access a variety of additional content and features for a fee and to engage with various advertisements and in-game offers that generate revenue for us. Our efforts to develop free-to-play games may prove unsuccessful or, even if successful, may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenues because, among other reasons:•free-to-play games have a relatively limited history, and it is unclear how popular this style of game will become or remain, or its future revenue potential;•our free-to-play strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because they are free, and that we will then be able to effectively monetize the games.  However, players may not widely download our games for a variety of reasons, including poor consumer reviews or other negative publicity, ineffective or insufficient marketing efforts, lack of sufficient community features, lack of prominent featuring on the platforms where they are marketed, or our inability to add or update engaging content on a relatively frequent basis;•even if our free-to-play games are widely downloaded, a significant portion of the revenues generated from these titles are derived from a relatively small concentration of players and we may fail to retain these or other users, or optimize the monetization of these games, for a variety of reasons, including game design or quality, lack of community features, or adequate customer support, gameplay issues such as game unavailability, long load times or an unexpected termination of the game due to data server or other technical issues, our inability to add or updated engaging content on a relatively frequent basis, or our failure to effectively respond and adapt to changing user preferences through game updates;•the billing and other capabilities of some smartphones and tablets are currently not optimized to enable users to purchase games or make in-app purchases, which may make it difficult for users of these devices to purchase our games or make in-app purchases, and could reduce our addressable customer base, at least in the short term; and•the Federal Trade Commission has indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors, and the Commission might issue rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases.We derive material revenues from distribution of our titles through third party mobile platforms, and if we are unable to maintain relationships with the owners of these platforms or if our access to these platforms was limited or unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business could be adversely affectedIf we are unable to maintain good relationships with third party mobile platform providers, such as Apple and Google, or our access to these platforms was limited or suspended based on any change in terms or policies that made the continued distribution of our titles on these platforms unfeasible or less profitable, or that required us to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns or other means to enhance the discoverability of our titles on these platforms, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Our ability to transact business through these platforms is subject to our compliance with their standard terms and conditions, which may be unilaterally amended at any time.  For example, the owners of these platforms set the revenue share they are entitled to receive, and may change that without input from or advance notice to us.  In addition, the standard terms and conditions of these platforms may impose restrictions on the types of content they will allow to be sold, the ways in which the content is offered and promoted, and the process and timing of accepting content for distribution.  Such restrictions could impair our ability to successfully market and sell our mobile games.  Furthermore, if any of the providers of these platforms determines that we are in violation of their standard terms and conditions, we may be prohibited from distributing our titles through these platforms, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.We also rely on the ongoing availability of these platforms.  If they experience prolonged periods of unavailability, it could have a material impact on our ability to generate revenue through these platforms, and our business and operating results could be harmed.  In addition, if these platforms fail to provide adequate levels of service, our customers' ability to access our games may be impacted, or customers may not receive any virtual items for which they have paid, which may adversely affect our brand and consumer good will.If we fail to develop and publish mobile games that achieve market acceptance, or continue to enhance our existing games, our revenues may sufferOur business depends on developing and publishing free-to-play and premium paid casual and mobile games that consumers will download and spend time and money on consistently.  We continue to invest significant resources in research and 36development, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and update our existing titles.  Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences, competing games and other forms of entertainment, and the emergence of new platforms.  If our games do not meet consumer expectations, or they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.  Furthermore, even if our games are successfully introduced and initially adopted, a failure to continue to update them with compelling content or any shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers could materially impact our operating results. If the use of smartphones and tablet devices to facilitate game platforms generally does not increase, our business could be adversely affectedWhile the number of people using mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablet devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years, the mobile market, particularly the market for mobile games, is still emerging and it may not grow as rapidly or robustly as we anticipate.  Our future success is partially dependent upon the continued growth and application of mobile devices for games. In addition, new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which some of our games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation platforms.If we are unable to secure new or ongoing content from third party development partners on favorable terms, or at all, our business could be adversely affectedIn addition to the games we develop internally, we acquire or license games, including some of our most successful games, from third party development partners located around the world.  Our success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain talented and reliable development partners to source new content and update existing content.  Our agreements with these development partners are in some instances not exclusive to us and will expire at various times.  If we are unable to renew these agreements on terms favorable to us or at all, or if our development partners enter into similar agreements with our competitors or choose to publish their own titles, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.  In addition, certain of our development partners are located in geographic regions of the world that continue to experience military and insurgency conflict, and political turmoil and unrest.  Any of these factors could impact the ability of these development partners to create and deliver content to us in a timely fashion or at all, and could restrict or prohibit our ability to remit payments to these development partners.  If we are unable to deliver compelling content to our customers or update existing content based on these occurrences, our ongoing business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.If our games contain programming errors or flaws, if a significant number of customers experience technical difficulties downloading or launching our games, or if we fail to continue to provide our customers with a high-quality customer experience, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and impair our ability to successfully execute our business strategy.A critical component of our strategy is providing a high-quality customer experience to our customers.  Our games may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after their launch, particularly as we launch new games under tight time constraints.  Porting games to new devices or languages may also result in the creation of errors that did not exist in the game as originally released.  In addition, our customers may experience technical difficulties downloading and launching our games due to the effects of third-party software on their computers, which we do not control.  We cannot provide assurances that our customer service team can resolve these types of technical difficulties, and if a significant number of our customers cannot download or launch our games, it would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.  We believe that if our customers have a negative experience with our games, they may be less inclined to continue or resume playing our games or recommend our games to other potential customers.  Undetected programming errors, game defects, data corruption and issues with third-party software can disrupt our operations, adversely affect the game experience of our customers, harm our reputation, cause our customers to stop playing our games and divert our resources, any of which could result in legal liability to us or harm our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business is based upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property.  Some of this intellectual property is in the form of software code, patented and other technologies and trade secrets that we use to develop and market our games.  Other intellectual property that we create includes audio-visual elements, such as graphics, music and storylines.  We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection and contracts to protect our intellectual property rights.  If we are not successful in protecting these rights, the value of our brand and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.While we believe that our issued patents or pending patent applications help to protect our business, we cannot assure you that our products, services or operations do not, or will not, infringe valid, enforceable patents of third parties, or that competitors will not devise new methods of competing with us that are not covered by our patents or patent applications.  In addition, we 37cannot assure you that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property or ongoing business strategies, or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable.  Moreover, we rely on intellectual property and technology developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms or at all.Effective trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our games and other products and services may be provided.  The laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies adequately against unauthorized copying or use, which could harm our competitive position.  We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties.  These licensees may take actions that could diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation, even if we have agreements prohibiting such activity.  To the extent third parties are obligated to indemnify us for breaches of our intellectual property rights, these third parties may be unable to meet these obligations.  Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.We depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmedWe believe that our success depends in part on our highly-skilled employee base, and our ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees throughout our organization.  This includes software developers and engineers, IT staff, game designers and producers, marketing specialists, analytics professionals, and customer service staff.  If we do not successfully hire, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, it is likely that we could experience significant disruptions in our operations and our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be impaired, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.Competition for the type of talent we seek to hire is increasingly intense in the geographic areas in which we operate.  As a result, we may incur significant costs to attract and retain highly-skilled employees.  We may be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary to sustain our business or support future growth.All of our officers and other employees in the United States are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace.  In addition, the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could delay the development and distribution of, and impair our ability to sell, our games and other products and services, harm our reputation and impair our ability to execute our business plans.  “Cheating” programs, scam offers, black-markets and other actions by third parties that seek to exploit our games and our players may affect our reputation and harm our operating resultsThird parties have developed, and may continue to develop, “cheating” programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings that could decrease the revenues we generate from our virtual economies, divert our players from our games or otherwise harm us. Cheating programs enable players to exploit vulnerabilities in our games to obtain virtual currency or other items that would otherwise generate in-app purchases for us, play the games in automated ways or obtain unfair advantages over other players.  In addition, third parties may attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. We devote significant resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if we are unable to do so quickly or effectively, it could damage our reputation and impact our business and results of operations"
5,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2014-02-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the CompanyIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and Company could materially impact our future performance and results.  The factors described below are the most significant risks that could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.General economic trends are unfavorableThe recent, economic downturn and adverse conditions in local, regional, national and global markets, including the current sovereign debt crises, have negatively impacted our operations and may continue to do so for an indeterminate period of time.  Although economic conditions improved somewhat in 2012 and 2013, there remains risk that the recovery will be short-lived, that the recovery may not include the industries or markets in which we operate, or the downturn may resume.  Our access to, or cost of, credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward trends.  Additionally, our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase, when revenues decline.  Accordingly, any persistence of poor economic conditions, or further deterioration, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business is sensitive to consumer confidence and reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending, which may result from the recent economic conditions, unemployment levels and other changes we cannot accurately predictDemand for entertainment and leisure activities is sensitive to consumers’ disposable incomes, which have been adversely affected by recent economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment.  Further declines in the residential real estate market, higher energy and transportation costs, changes in consumer confidence, increases in individual tax rates, and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  This could result in fewer patrons visiting our racetracks, gaming and wagering facilities and online wagering sites, and may impact our customers’ ability to wager with the same frequency and maintain their wagering level profiles.  Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if it occurs in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Accordingly, any significant loss of customers or decline in wagering could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time.  From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry.  Moreover, many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of any such changes in tax laws or fee increases, or their administration; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.23Our debt facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur debt facilities contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create liens on certain assets;•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.We have pledged and will pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our debt facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could proceed against the collateral we have granted them.Under our debt facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facilities or the existing agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In the event of any default under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or•require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.If the indebtedness under our debt facilities or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.We may not be able to identify and complete acquisition, expansion or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations.We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects.  The integration of new operations and any other properties we may acquire or develop will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business.  The process of integrating new properties or projects may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers.  Furthermore, current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues.  We cannot assure that any new properties or developments will be completed or integrated successfully.Management of new properties or business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  We cannot assure that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or developments.We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses, including our recent acquisitions of Oxford and Riverwalk, into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other 24resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Furthermore, the costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include:•restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;•non-recurring acquisition costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and•costs of imposing financial and management controls (such as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and operating, administrative and information systems.Although we perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks which include:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third party insurers;•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•the potential loss of key employees or customers;•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines, which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may adversely infringe on the intellectual property rights of othersIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties.  Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future.  We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products.  Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.  However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all.  We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of our products and services if we become subject to litigation relating to intellectual property infringement.Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights.  Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.  The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation surrounding it has the effect of increasing the risks associated with certain of our product offerings, particularly in the area of advance deposit wagering, or ADW.  There can be no assurance that we would not become a party to litigation surrounding our ADW business or that such litigation would not cause us to suffer losses or disruption in our business strategy.We are susceptible to unauthorized disclosure of our source codeWe may not be able to protect our computer source code from being copied if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code. We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code.  If unauthorized disclosure of a significant 25portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code.  This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality; which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.  Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks.We depend on key personnelOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the skills and efforts of our senior executives and management team including Robert L. Evans, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our senior executives and key personnel, we cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us, and their retention is affected by the competitiveness of our terms of employment and our ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies.  In addition, certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship.  Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impair our operations.  Our inability to retain key personnel could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Catastrophic events could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsA disruption or failure in our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  For example, Churchill Downs, Harlow’s, Riverwalk, Fair Grounds and its related OTBs and Calder could all be adversely affected by flooding or hurricanes.  While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, our coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of natural disasters in the future, or if natural disasters adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons, the disruption could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions.  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements.Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plansSome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future.We process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our businessWe receive, store and process personal information and other customer data.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data.  Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.  While the Company maintains insurance coverage specific to cyber-insurance matters, any failure on our part to maintain adequate safeguards may subject us to significant liabilities.  Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our customers’ 26information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.  The Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is compromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation.  Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm to our reputationWe store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, contact preferences and payment account information.  For example, we store personal information from TwinSpires.com account holders, from our gaming customers’ rewards accounts and from ticket sales at our racetracks.  It is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.Our business is subject to online security risk, including security breachesWe store and transmit users' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability.  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and be exposed to litigation or potential liability for us.  Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security. We are subject to payment-related risks, such as risk associated with the fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, which could have adverse effects on our business or results of operations due to chargebacks from customers We allow funding and payments to accounts using a variety of methods, including electronic funds transfer (“EFT”), and credit and debit cards. As we continue to introduce new funding or payment options to our players, we may be subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements. We also may be subject to the risk of fraudulent use of credit or debit cards, or other funding and/or payment options. For certain funding or payment options, including credit and debit cards, we may pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and, therefore, raise operating costs and reduce profitability. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to rules and requirements governing EFT, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees or possibly lose our ability to accept credit, debit cards, or other forms of payment from customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Chargebacks occur when customers seek to void credit card or other payment transactions. Cardholders are intended to be able to reverse card transactions only if there has been unauthorized use of the card or the services contracted for have not been provided. In our business, customers occasionally seek to reverse their online gaming losses through chargebacks. Although we place great emphasis on control procedures to protect from chargebacks, these control procedures may not be sufficient to protect us from adverse effects on our business or results of operations.Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Any violation of FCPA regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.27We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersThe integrity of the horseracing, gaming and pari-mutuel wagering industries must be perceived as fair to patrons and the public at large.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, the necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could significantly lower attendance, amounts wagered and reduce revenues.Risks Related to Our Racing OperationsOur racing operations are highly regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur racing business is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized gaming in states where we operate.  Our wagering and racing facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities, including authorities in Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana and Florida.  To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to attain, loss of or material change in our racing business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to licensing requirements, state regulatory authorities can have a significant impact on the operation of our business.  For example, in Florida, a thoroughbred racetrack conducting a live meet has control over hosting out-of-state racing signals and receives commissions on wagers placed at other racetracks throughout the state.  When two thoroughbred racetracks operate live meets concurrently, both have the opportunity to be the “host track” for out-of-state signals, and other Florida racetracks must choose a single live racetrack to host their pari-mutuel wagering.  Historically, Calder was the only live racetrack in Florida for the majority of its racing season.  However, during 2013 Calder and Gulfstream Park began simultaneously conducting live thoroughbred racing, in certain months, and this overlapping of live racing resulted in direct competition for on-track horseracing, in the intrastate and interstate simulcast markets and for horses in South Florida, which negatively affected Calder’s ability to achieve full field horse races and to generate handle on live racing, as further described in Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Recent Developments"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Likewise, in Illinois the IRB has the authority to designate racetracks as “host track” for the purpose of receiving host track revenues generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races.  Racetracks that are designated as “host track” obtain and distribute out of state simulcast signals for the State of Illinois.  Under Illinois law, the “host track” is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on the related pari-mutuel wagering.  Should Arlington or Calder cease to be as “host tracks” during these periods, the loss of hosting revenues could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, Arlington is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenues monies that are otherwise payable to Arlington’s purse account.  These statutorily or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session, and their reduction or elimination could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.  If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Economic trends specific to the horse racing industry are unfavorableHorseracing and related activities, as well as the gaming services we provide, are similar to other leisure activities in that they represent discretionary expenditures likely to decline during economic downturns.  In some cases, even the perception of an impending economic downturn or the continuation of a recessionary climate can be enough to discourage consumers from spending on leisure activities.  These economic trends can impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  For example, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $1.1 million of bad debt expense, net of purses, resulting from the bankruptcy filing of New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation (“NYCOTB”). During 2009, NYCOTB filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy and on January 25, 2011, its Chapter 9 bankruptcy case was dismissed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and NYCOTB ceased operations.  We will continue to closely monitor participants’ operational viability within the industry and any related collection issues which could potentially have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our racing business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increase28All of our racetracks face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and we expect the number of competitors to increase.  See subheading “J. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of racing industry competition.All of our racetracks face competition in the simulcast market.  Approximately 43,830 thoroughbred horse races are conducted annually in the United States.  Of these races, we host approximately 3,560 races each year, or about 8.1% of the total.  As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races.  As a racetrack operator, we also compete with other racetracks running live meets at or near the same time as our horse races.  In recent years, this competition has increased as more states have allowed additional, automated gaming activities, such as slot machines, at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions.Calder Race Course faces direct competition from another thoroughbred racetrack in Miami, Florida.  The two racetracks are located approximately 6.5 miles apart.  Under Florida law, racetracks are permitted to race throughout the year, subject to an annual notification filed with the State of Florida on February 28th of each year.  As a result, Calder and the other racetrack, respectively, may independently elect to host live races on the same days.  Historically, hosting live races on the same day as the other track has had a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  On July 6, 2013, Calder and a competing racetrack conducted their first simultaneous live racing performances, and both racetracks are scheduled to continue to overlap live racing on certain dates through, at least, June 2014. Hosting live races on the same day as the other track has had a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations at Calder.Competition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges for our racing business.  Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, our racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both their continued operations and expansion.  Our racing business also faces significantly greater costs in operating our racing business compared to costs borne by these gaming companies.  Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-based gaming companies.  Many online and web-based gaming companies are based off-shore and avoid regulation under U.S. state and federal laws.  These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks.  Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The popularity of horse racing is decliningThere has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives as discussed above.  According to industry sources, pari-mutuel handle declined 27% from 2007 to 2011 and generated annual increases of 1% during each of 2012 and 2013.  We believe lower interest in racing may have a negative impact on revenues and profitability in our racing business, as well as our ADW business, which is dependent on racing content provided by our racing business and other track operators.  Our business plan anticipates that we will attract new customers to our racetracks, OTBs and ADW operations.   A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, or a continued generalized decline in interest in racing, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our racing business is geographically concentrated and experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in operating resultsWe conduct our racing business at four racetracks: Churchill Downs, Calder, Fair Grounds and Arlington.  A significant portion of our racing revenues are generated by two events, the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our four racetracks, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs at a time that would affect the Kentucky Derby or Kentucky Oaks, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to seasonality and other factors.  We have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks, and the number of live racing days varies from year to year.  The number of live racing days we are able to offer directly affects our results of operations.  A significant decrease in the number of live racing days and/or live races, including the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horseracesWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields.  A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horseraces.  Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors. It depends on our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and it also depends on the overall horse population available for racing.  Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition 29from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases such as the neurologic form of Equine Herpes Virus-I and Strangles.  If any of our racetracks is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it would have a material impact on our profitability.  Finally, if we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease.We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenues for race purses and capital improvements.  For example, Churchill Downs and Arlington are experiencing heightened competition from racinos in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia whose purses are supplemented by gaming revenues.  The opening of the Genting New York Resort at Aqueduct racetrack has enhanced the purse structure at New York racetracks as compared to historical levels.  Ohio has authorized four land-based casinos by voter referendum and video lottery terminals at seven Ohio racetracks through executive order.  Our failure to attract full fields could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racingSince horseracing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracksThe IHA, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the “Horsemen’s Groups”).  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s Groups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  In addition, the agreements between other racetracks and their Horsemen’s Groups typically provide that those racetracks must receive consent from the Horsemen’s Groups before we can accept wagers on their races.  For example, from time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the “FHBPA”) which represents horsemen in Florida and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association (“KHBPA”) have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Further, the IHA and various state laws require that we have written agreements with Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks in order to simulcast races on an export basis.  In addition, our simulcasting agreements are generally subject to the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We also have written agreements with the Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana and Florida.  Florida law requires Calder to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenues from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association (the “FTBOA”) governing the contribution of a portion of revenues from slot machines gaming to breeders’, stallion, and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted at Calder before Calder can receive a license to conduct slot machine gaming.It is not certain that we will be able to maintain agreements with, or to obtain required consent from, Horsemen’s Groups.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, our horsemen on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third parties’ races could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities.  From time to time, we are unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.30Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationAlthough we carry jockey accident insurance at each of our racetracks to cover personal jockey injuries which may occur during races or daily workouts, there are certain exclusions to our insurance coverage, and we are still subject to litigation from injured participants.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.  Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as this litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.Ownership and development of real estate requires significant expenditures and is subject to riskOur racing operations require us to own extensive real estate holdings.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  The real estate industry is also capital intensive and sensitive to interest rates.  Further, significant expenditures, including property taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property, which expenditures negatively impact our operating results.In addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.Our business depends on utilizing and providing totalisator servicesOur customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalisator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horseraces.  The failure to keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively or develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product.  A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering systems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horseracing.  In addition, a totalisator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume.United Tote also has contracts to provide totalisator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses.  Its totalisator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner.  Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalisator service contracts, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Gaming BusinessOur gaming business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur gaming operations exist at the discretion of the states where we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved.  While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to continue to operate or to expand our gaming operations.Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines and loss limits.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy.Our gaming business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur gaming operations operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources.  The gaming industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Our gaming operations 31also face competition from Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  We do not enjoy the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them.  Additionally, web-based interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on web-based activities are clarified.  We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry.  In addition, Florida legislators continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos.  Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure. Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  See subheading “J. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of gaming industry competition.Our gaming business is geographically concentratedWe conduct our gaming business at five principal locations: Oxford in Oxford, Maine, Riverwalk in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Harlow’s in Greenville, Mississippi, Calder Casino in Miami Gardens, Florida, and Fair Grounds Slots in New Orleans, Louisiana.  We also operate video poker machines throughout Louisiana through our subsidiary, VSI.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our principal gaming operations, or if economic or regulatory conditions were to become unfavorable in one or more of the regions in which they operate, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The development of new gaming venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesThe Company may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos or other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenues are attributable to slot and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  In recent years, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation. In recent years, for example, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win.  Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.We materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.Risks Related to Our Online BusinessOur business strategy is premised, in part, on the legalization of online real money gaming in the United States and our ability to predict and capitalize on any such legalization In the last few years, Delaware, Nevada, California, Florida, Mississippi, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Washington D.C. and the Federal government have considered legislation that would legalize online real money gaming. To date, only Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted such legislation. If a large number of additional states or the Federal government fail to enact online real money gaming legislation or we are unable to obtain the necessary licenses to operate online real money gaming websites in United States jurisdictions where such games are legalized, our future growth could be materially impaired. In addition, states or the Federal government may legalize online real money gaming in a manner that is unfavorable to us. For example, several states and the Federal government are considering draft laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada and New Jersey, 32state jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing online real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, we may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if we are unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction. There also exists in the online real money gaming industry a significant “first mover” advantage. Our ability to compete effectively in respect of a particular style of online real money gaming in the United States may be premised on introducing a style of gaming before our competitors. Failing to do so (“move first”) could materially impair our ability to grow in the online real money gaming space. In addition to the risk that online real money gaming will be legalized in a manner unfavorable to us, we may fail to accurately predict when online real money gaming will be legalized in significant jurisdictions. The legislative process in each state and at the Federal level is unique and capable of rapid, often unpredictable change. If we fail to accurately forecast when and how, if at all, online real money gaming will be legalized in additional state jurisdictions, such failure could impair our readiness to introduce online real money gaming offerings in such jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ADW business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessTwinSpires, our ADW business, accepts advance deposit wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet at TwinSpires.com.  The ADW business is heavily regulated, and laws governing advance deposit wagering vary from state to state.  Some states have expressly authorized advance deposit wagering by their own residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or advance deposit wagering and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited their residents from placing wagers through advance deposit wagering hubs located in different states.  We believe that an ADW business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to ADW businesses in other states is not expressly prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions.  However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state gaming laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.  In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate advance deposit wagering.Our expansion opportunities with respect to advance deposit wagering may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit advance deposit wagering.  Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make advance deposit wagering expressly unlawful, this could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For example, previously existing ADW regulations in Illinois expired on December 31, 2012, and we ceased accepting wagers from Illinois residents in January 2013 until June 2013, when Illinois ADW regulations were extended.  Furthermore, we ceased accepting wagers from Texas residents in September 2013, due to the enforcement of an existing Texas law prohibiting ADW wagering.  In addition, the regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our ADW business.  From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for advance deposit wagering.Furthermore, many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations, which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Such effects could have a material, adverse impact to the success of our advance deposit wagering operations.Our ADW business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our businessWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing.  The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting.  For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories.  It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.  This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services, which could harm our business, financial condition and 33results of operations.  In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust.  Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices.  We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation.  If that were to occur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs.  Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of online gaming and impair our business.Our ADW business faces strong competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur ADW business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses.  Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our ADW business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other ADW businesses.  In addition, we face competition from a new wagering product called exchange wagering, a variation of pari-mutuel wagering in which bettors wager directly against one another, establishing their own odds on a horserace.  Both California and New Jersey legislatures have approved exchange wagering.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do.  In addition, we believe that new competitors may enter the ADW business with relative ease because of the low cost of entry.  As a result, we anticipate increased competition in our ADW business.  It is difficult to predict the impact of increased competition on our ADW business.  See subheading “J. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of ADW industry competition.A recent clarification on the impact of the Federal Wire Act of 1961 on Internet gaming could increase competitionDuring 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice clarified its position on the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”), which had historically been interpreted to outlaw all forms of gambling across states lines.  The department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the Wire Act applied only to a sporting event or contest, but did not apply to other forms of Internet gambling, including online betting unrelated to sporting events.  The Justice Department indicated that many forms of online gambling could become legal under federal law, which could include legalized poker and generalized gaming including state lottery wagering.  As a result, we anticipate increased competition to our ADW business from various other forms of online gaming.  It is difficult to predict the level of increased competition and the impact of increased competition on our ADW business.Our inability to retain our core customer base or our failure to attract new customers could harm our businessWe utilize technology and marketing relationships to retain current customers and attract new customers.  If we are unable to retain our core customer base through robust content offerings and other popular features, if we lose customers to our competitors, or if we fail to attract new customers, our businesses would fail to grow or would be adversely affected.System failures or damage from earthquakes, fires, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attack or other unforeseen events could harm our businessOur ADW business depends upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage; however, certain risks still exist.  Thus, our systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our website and our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  Interruptions in our services or a breach of customers’ secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our site, and could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, in turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our website.  We have property and business interruption insurance covering damage or interruption of our systems.  However, this insurance might not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.Security breaches, computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operations34Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry.  Many companies, including ours, have been the target of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.We carry insurance covering many of these risks, including network security, first party extortion threats and business interruptions, but there are certain exclusions to this coverage and the insurance limits may not be sufficient to fully mitigate all financial damage to the Company.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionThe gaming sector is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive.Failure to comply with laws requiring us to block access to certain individuals, based upon their geographic location, may result in legal penalties or an impairment to our ability to offer online real money gaming, in general Individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal may nonetheless seek to engage our online real money gaming products. While we take steps to block access by individuals in such jurisdictions, those steps may be unsuccessful. In the event that individuals in jurisdictions in which online real money gaming is illegal engage our online real money gaming systems, we may be subject to criminal sanctions, regulatory penalties, the loss of existing or future licenses necessary to offer online real money gaming or other legal liabilities, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on us, and therefore our businesses, financial condition and results of operations. For example, gambling laws and regulations in many jurisdictions require gaming industry participants to maintain strict compliance with various laws and regulations. If we are unsuccessful in blocking access to our online real money gaming products by individuals in a jurisdiction where such products are illegal, we could lose or be prevented from obtaining a license necessary to offer online real money gaming in a jurisdiction in which such products are legal. Furthermore, our inability to restrict illegal access could materially impact our other gaming licenses as well"
7,CHDN,CHURCHILL DOWNS INC,2013-02-27,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSRisks Related to the CompanyIn addition to risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of business that are common to all businesses, important factors that are specific to our industry and Company could materially impact our future performance and results.  The factors described below are the most significant risks that could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.General economic trends are unfavorableThe recent, economic downturn and adverse conditions in local, regional, national and global markets, including the current sovereign debt crises, have negatively impacted our operations and may continue to do so for an indeterminate period of time.  Although economic conditions improved somewhat in 2012, there remains risk that the recovery will be short-lived, that the recovery may not include the industries or markets in which we operate, or the downturn may resume.  Our access to, or cost of, credit may be impacted to the extent global and U.S. credit markets are affected by downward trends.  Additionally, our ability to respond to periods of economic contraction may be limited, as certain of our costs remain fixed or even increase, when revenues decline.  Accordingly, any persistence of poor economic conditions, or further deterioration, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business is sensitive to consumer confidence and reductions in consumers’ discretionary spending, which may result from the recent economic conditions, unemployment levels and other changes we cannot accurately predictDemand for entertainment and leisure activities is sensitive to consumers’ disposable incomes, which have been adversely affected by recent economic conditions and the persistence of elevated levels of unemployment.  Further declines in the residential real estate market, higher energy and transportation costs, changes in consumer confidence, increases in individual tax rates, and other factors that we cannot accurately predict may reduce the disposable income of our customers.  This could result in fewer patrons visiting our racetracks, gaming and wagering facilities and online wagering sites, and may impact our customers’ ability to wager with the same frequency and maintain their wagering level profiles.  Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could affect us even if it occurs in other markets.  For example, reduced wagering levels and profitability at racetracks from which we carry racing content could cause certain racetracks to cancel races or cease operations and therefore reduce the content we could provide to our customers.  Accordingly, any significant loss of customers or decline in wagering could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are vulnerable to additional or increased taxes and feesWe believe that the prospect of raising significant additional revenue through taxes and fees is one of the primary reasons that certain jurisdictions permit legalized gaming.  As a result, gaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to the normal federal, state, provincial and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees may be increased at any time.  From time to time, legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry.  Moreover, many states and municipalities, including ones in which we operate, are currently experiencing budgetary pressures that may make it more likely they would seek to impose additional taxes and fees on our operations.  It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of any such changes in tax laws or fee increases, or their administration; however, if enacted, such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our credit facilities contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our businessOur credit facilities contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:•incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;•pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, repurchase common shares or make other restricted payments;•make certain investments;•sell certain assets or consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;•create liens on certain assets;•enter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and21Table of Contents•designate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.We have pledged and will pledge a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our credit facilities.  If any of these lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness and our lenders could proceed against the collateral we have granted them.Under our credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios.  Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios.  A failure to comply with the covenants contained in our credit facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facilities or the existing agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:•will not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;•could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or•require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.If the indebtedness under our credit facilities or our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.We may not be able to identify and complete acquisition, expansion or divestiture projects on time, on budget or as plannedWe expect to pursue expansion, acquisition and divestiture opportunities, and we regularly evaluate opportunities for development, including acquisitions or other strategic corporate transactions which may expand our business operations.We could face challenges in identifying development projects that fit our strategic objectives, identifying potential acquisition or divestiture candidates and/or development partners, finding buyers, negotiating projects on acceptable terms, and managing and integrating the acquisition or development projects.  The integration of new operations and any other properties we may acquire or develop will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily divert attention from our day-to-day business.  The process of integrating new properties or projects may also interrupt the activities of those businesses, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The divestiture of existing businesses may be affected by our ability to identify potential buyers.  Furthermore, current or future regulation may postpone a divestiture pending certain resolutions to federal, state or local legislative issues.  We cannot assure that any new properties or developments will be completed or integrated successfully.Management of new properties or business operations, especially those in new lines of business or different geographic areas, may require that we increase our managerial resources.  We cannot assure that we will be able to manage the combined operations effectively or realize any of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or developments.We may experience difficulty in integrating recent or future acquisitions into our operationsWe have completed acquisition transactions in the past and we may pursue acquisitions from time to time in the future.  The successful integration of newly acquired businesses, including our recent acquisitions of Riverwalk and Bluff, into our operations has required and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial managerial, operating, financial and other resources and may also lead to a diversion of our attention from our ongoing business concerns.  We may not be able to successfully integrate new businesses or realize projected revenue gains, cost savings and synergies in connection with those acquisitions on the timetable contemplated, if at all.  Furthermore, the costs of integrating businesses we acquire could significantly impact our short-term operating results.  These costs could include:•restructuring charges associated with the acquisitions;•non-recurring acquisition costs, including accounting and legal fees, investment banking fees and recognition of transaction-related costs or liabilities; and•costs of imposing financial and management controls (such as compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) and operating, administrative and information systems.Although we perform financial, operational and legal diligence on the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses and our ability to continue to operate them successfully and integrate them into our existing operations.  In any acquisition we make, we face risks 22Table of Contentswhich include:•the risk that the acquired business may not further our business strategy or that we paid more than the business was worth;•the potential adverse impact on our relationships with partner companies or third-party providers of technology or products;•the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities for which we may have no recourse against the sellers or third party insurers;•costs and complications in maintaining required regulatory approvals or obtaining further regulatory approvals necessary to implement the acquisition in accordance with our strategy;•the risks of acquiring businesses and/or entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;•the potential loss of key employees or customers;•the possibility that we may be unable to retain or recruit managers with the necessary skills to manage the acquired businesses; and•changes to legal and regulatory guidelines, which may negatively affect acquisitions.If we are unsuccessful in overcoming these risks, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may adversely infringe on the intellectual property rights of othersIn the course of our business, we may become aware of potentially relevant patents or other intellectual property rights held by other parties.  Many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained, and may obtain in the future, patents or other intellectual property rights that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we currently offer or may plan to offer in the future.  We evaluate the validity and applicability of these intellectual property rights and determine in each case whether we must negotiate licenses to incorporate or use the proprietary technologies in our products.  Claims of intellectual property infringement may also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements.  However, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all.  We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against the development and sale of our products and services if we become subject to litigation relating to intellectual property infringement.Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation within our industry and the protection and validity of our intellectual property rights.  Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.  The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation surrounding it has the effect of increasing the risks associated with certain of our product offerings, particularly in the area of advance deposit wagering, or ADW.  There can be no assurance that we would not become a party to litigation surrounding our ADW business or that such litigation would not cause us to suffer losses or disruption in our business strategy.We are susceptible to unauthorized disclosure of our source codeWe may not be able to protect our computer source code from being copied if there is an unauthorized disclosure of source code. We take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code.  If unauthorized disclosure of a significant portion of our source code occurs, we could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code.  This could make it easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality; which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins.  Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase security risks.23Table of ContentsWe depend on key personnelOur continued success and our ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent upon, among other things, the skills and efforts of our senior executives and management team including Robert L. Evans, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our senior executives and key personnel, we cannot guarantee that these individuals will remain with us, and their retention is affected by the competitiveness of our terms of employment and our ability to compete effectively against other gaming companies.  In addition, certain of our key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities.  If the gaming authorities were to find a key employee unsuitable for licensing, we may be required to sever the employee relationship.  Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.  Either result could significantly impair our operations.  Our inability to retain key personnel could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Catastrophic events could cause a significant and continued disruption to our operationsA disruption or failure in our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas.  For example, Churchill Downs, Harlow’s, Riverwalk, Fair Grounds and its related OTBs and Calder could all be adversely affected by flooding or hurricanes.  While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some natural disasters, our coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limits on maximum benefits.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect, if at all, on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions or other disasters.  If any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted or face prolonged closure as a result of natural disasters in the future, or if natural disasters adversely impact general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons, the disruption could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain exclusions.  Our level of property insurance coverage, which is subject to policy maximum limits, may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.  In addition, certain casualty events may not be covered at all under our policies.  Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.Our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to meet certain standards related to insurance coverage.  Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements.Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future plansSome of our employees are represented by labor unions.  A strike or other work stoppage at one of our properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  From time to time, we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non-union employees.  We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future.We process, store and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our businessWe receive, store and process personal information and other customer data.  There are numerous federal, state and local laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other data.  Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other player data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.  While the Company maintains insurance coverage specific to cyber-insurance matters, any failure on our part to maintain adequate safeguards may subject us to significant liabilities.  Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as vendors, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our customers’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business.  The Company is also subject to payment card association rules and obligations under its contracts with payment card processors. Under these rules and obligations, if information is compromised, the Company could be liable to payment card issuers for the associated expense and penalties.  In addition, if the Company fails to follow payment card industry security standards, even if no customer information is 24Table of Contentscompromised, the Company could incur significant fines or experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs.In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to customers when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California’s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to practically implement.  The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation.  Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm to our reputationWe store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers, which may include names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, contact preferences and payment account information.  For example, we store personal information from Twinspires.com account holders, from our gaming customers’ rewards accounts and from ticket sales at our racetracks.  It is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.Our business is subject to online security risk, including security breachesWe store and transmit users' proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation and potential liability.  Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.  If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and be exposed to litigation or potential liability for us.  Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or applicable anti-money laundering regulations could have a negative impact on usWe are subject to regulations imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Any violation of FCPA regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations.  Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations by any of our properties could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.A lack of confidence in the integrity of our core businesses could affect our ability to retain our customers and engage with new customersThe integrity of the horseracing, gaming and pari-mutuel wagering industries must be perceived as fair to patrons and the public at large.  To prevent cheating or erroneous payouts, the necessary oversight processes must be in place to ensure that such activities cannot be manipulated.  A loss of confidence in the fairness of our industries could significantly lower attendance, amounts wagered and reduce revenues.Risks Related to Our Racing OperationsOur racing operations are highly regulated, and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur racing business is subject to extensive state and local regulation, and we depend on continued state approval of legalized gaming in states where we operate.  Our wagering and racing facilities must meet the licensing requirements of various regulatory authorities, including authorities in Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana and Florida.  To date, we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our racetracks.  However, we may be unable to maintain our existing licenses.  The failure to attain, loss of or material change in our racing business licenses, registrations, permits or approvals may materially limit the number of races we conduct, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to licensing requirements, state regulatory authorities can have a significant impact on the operation of our business.  For example, in Florida, a thoroughbred racetrack conducting a live meet has control over hosting out-of-state racing signals 25Table of Contentsand receives commissions on wagers placed at other racetracks throughout the state.  When two thoroughbred racetracks operate live meets concurrently, both have the opportunity to be the “host track” for out-of-state signals, and other Florida racetracks must choose a single live racetrack to host their pari-mutuel wagering.  Calder is the only live racetrack in Florida for the majority of its racing season and it could be adversely affected if another track conducted a meet with more overlapping dates.  Likewise, in Illinois the IRB has the authority to designate racetracks as “host track” for the purpose of receiving host track revenues generated during periods when no racetrack is conducting live races.  Racetracks that are designated as “host track” obtain and distribute out of state simulcast signals for the State of Illinois.  Under Illinois law, the “host track” is entitled to a larger portion of commissions on the related pari-mutuel wagering.  Should Arlington or Calder cease to be as “host tracks” during these periods, the loss of hosting revenue could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, Arlington is statutorily entitled to recapture as revenues monies that are otherwise payable to Arlington’s purse account.  These statutorily or regulatory established revenue sources are subject to change every legislative session, and their reduction or elimination could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are also subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing the serving of alcoholic beverages.  If we are not in compliance with these laws, it could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Economic trends specific to the horse racing industry are unfavorableHorseracing and related activities, as well as the gaming services we provide, are similar to other leisure activities in that they represent discretionary expenditures likely to decline during economic downturns.  In some cases, even the perception of an impending economic downturn or the continuation of a recessionary climate can be enough to discourage consumers from spending on leisure activities.  These economic trends can impact the financial viability of other industry constituents, making collection of amounts owed to us uncertain.  For example, during the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $1.1 million of bad debt expense, net of purses, resulting from the bankruptcy filing of New York City Off-Track Betting Corporation (“NYCOTB”). During 2009, NYCOTB filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy and on January 25, 2011, its Chapter 9 bankruptcy case was dismissed by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, and NYCOTB ceased operations.  We will continue to closely monitor participants’ operational viability within the industry and any related collection issues which could potentially have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our racing business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseAll of our racetracks face competition from a variety of sources, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Competitive gaming activities include traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized and non-legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, and we expect the number of competitors to increase.  See subheading “J. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of racing industry competition.All of our racetracks face competition in the simulcast market.  Approximately 46,000 thoroughbred horse races are conducted annually in the United States.  Of these races, we host approximately 4,000 races each year, or around nine percent of the total.  As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races.  As a racetrack operator, we also compete with other racetracks running live meets at or near the same time as our horse races.  In recent years, this competition has increased as more states have allowed additional, automated gaming activities, such as slot machines, at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions.Calder Race Course faces direct competition from another thoroughbred racetrack in Miami, Florida.  The two racetracks are located approximately 6.5 miles apart.  Under Florida law, racetracks are permitted to race throughout the year, subject to an annual notification filed with the State of Florida on February 28th of each year.  As a result, Calder and the other racetrack, respectively, may independently elect to host live races on the same days.  Historically, hosting live races on the same day as the other track has had a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Competition from web-based businesses presents additional challenges for our racing business.  Unlike most online and web-based gaming companies, our racetracks require significant and ongoing capital expenditures for both their continued operations and expansion.  Our racing business also faces significantly greater costs in operating our racing business compared to costs borne by these gaming companies.  Our racing business cannot offer the same number of gaming options as online and Internet-based gaming companies.  Many online and web-based gaming companies are based off-shore and avoid regulation under U.S. state and federal laws.  These companies may divert wagering dollars from pari-mutuel wagering venues, such as our racetracks.  Our inability to compete successfully with these competitors could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.26Table of ContentsThe popularity of horse racing is decliningThere has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering on live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other wagering and entertainment alternatives as discussed above.  According to Equibase, pari-mutuel handle in the U.S. declined 7.3% between 2010 and 2009, declined 5.7% between 2011 and 2010 and remained fairly flat during 2012, increasing 1.0% compared to the same period in 2011.  We believe lower interest in racing may have a negative impact on revenues and profitability in our racing business, as well as our ADW business, which is dependent on racing content provided by our racing business and other track operators.  Our business plan anticipates that we will attract new customers to our racetracks, OTBs and ADW operations.   A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, or a continued generalized decline in interest in racing, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our racing business is geographically concentrated and experiences significant seasonal fluctuations in operating resultsWe conduct our racing business at four racetracks: Churchill Downs, Calder, Fair Grounds and Arlington.  A significant portion of our racing revenues are generated by two events, the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our four racetracks, particularly one occurring at Churchill Downs at a time that would affect the Kentucky Derby or Kentucky Oaks, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we experience significant fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to seasonality and other factors.  We have a limited number of live racing days at our racetracks, and the number of live racing days varies from year to year.  The number of live racing days we are able to offer directly affects our results of operations.  A significant decrease in the number of live racing days and/or live races, including the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks, could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to attract a sufficient number of horses and trainers to achieve full field horseracesWe believe that patrons prefer to wager on races with a large number of horses, commonly referred to as full fields.  A failure to offer races with full fields results in less wagering on our horseraces.  Our ability to attract full fields depends on several factors. It depends on our ability to offer and fund competitive purses and it also depends on the overall horse population available for racing.  Various factors have led to declines in the horse population in certain areas of the country, including competition from racetracks in other areas, increased costs and changing economic returns for owners and breeders, and the spread of various debilitating and contagious equine diseases such as the neurologic form of Equine Herpes Virus-I and Strangles.  If any of our racetracks is faced with a sustained outbreak of a contagious equine disease, it would have a material impact on our profitability.  Finally, if we are unable to attract horse owners to stable and race their horses at our racetracks by offering a competitive environment, including improved facilities, well-maintained racetracks, better conditions for backstretch personnel involved in the care and training of horses stabled at our racetracks and a competitive purse structure, our profitability could also decrease.We also face increased competition for horses and trainers from racetracks that are licensed to operate slot machines and other electronic gaming machines that provide these racetracks an advantage in generating new additional revenues for race purses and capital improvements.  For example, Churchill Downs and Arlington are experiencing heightened competition from racinos in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia whose purses are supplemented by gaming revenues.  The opening of the Genting New York Resort at Aqueduct racetrack has enhanced the purse structure at New York racetracks as compared to historical levels.  Ohio has authorized four land-based casinos by voter referendum and video lottery terminals at seven Ohio racetracks through executive order.  Our failure to attract full fields could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Inclement weather and other conditions may affect our ability to conduct live racingSince horseracing is conducted outdoors, unfavorable weather conditions, including extremely high and low temperatures, high winds, storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, could cause events to be canceled and/or attendance to be lower, resulting in reduced wagering.  Our operations are subject to reduced patronage, disruptions or complete cessation of operations due to weather conditions, natural disasters and other casualties.  If a business interruption were to occur due to inclement weather and continue for a significant length of time at any of our racetracks, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We depend on agreements with industry constituents including horsemen and other racetracksThe IHA, as well as various state racing laws, require that we have written agreements with the horsemen at our racetracks in order to simulcast races, and, in some cases, conduct live racing. Certain industry groups negotiate these agreements on behalf of the horsemen (the “Horsemen’s Groups”).  These agreements provide that we must receive the consent of the Horsemen’s 27Table of ContentsGroups at the racetrack conducting live races before we may allow third parties to accept wagers on those races.  In addition, the agreements between other racetracks and their Horsemen’s Groups typically provide that those racetracks must receive consent from the Horsemen’s Groups before we can accept wagers on their races.  For example, from time to time, the Thoroughbred Owners of California, the Horsemen’s Group representing horsemen in California, the Florida Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association, Inc. (the “FHBPA”) which represents horsemen in Florida and the Kentucky Horsemen’s Benevolent and Protective Association (“KHBPA”) have withheld their consent to send or receive racing signals among racetracks.  Further, the IHA and various state laws require that we have written agreements with Horsemen’s Groups at our racetracks in order to simulcast races on an export basis.  In addition, our simulcasting agreements are generally subject to the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups.  Failure to receive the consent of these Horsemen’s Groups for new and renewing simulcast agreements could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We also have written agreements with the Horsemen’s Groups with regards to the proceeds of gaming machines in Louisiana and Florida.  Florida law requires Calder to have an agreement with the FHBPA governing the contribution of a portion of revenues from slot machine gaming to purses on live thoroughbred races conducted at Calder and an agreement with the Florida Thoroughbred Breeders and Owners Association (the “FTBOA”) governing the contribution of a portion of revenues from slot machines gaming to breeders’, stallion, and special racing awards on live thoroughbred races conducted at Calder before Calder can receive a license to conduct slot machine gaming.It is not certain that we will be able to maintain agreements with, or to obtain required consent from, Horsemen’s Groups.  We currently negotiate formal agreements with the applicable Horsemen’s Groups at Fair Grounds, Arlington and Calder on an annual basis.  The failure to maintain agreements with, or obtain consents from, our horsemen on satisfactory terms or the refusal by a Horsemen’s Group to consent to third parties accepting wagers on our races or our accepting wagers on third parties’ races could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we have agreements with other racetracks for the distribution of racing content through both the import of other racetracks’ signals for wagering at our properties and the export of our racing signal for wagering at other racetracks’ facilities.  From time to time, we are unable to reach agreements on terms acceptable to us.  As a result, we may be unable to distribute our racing content to other locations or to receive other racetracks’ racing content for wagering at our racetracks.  The inability to distribute our racing content could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Horse racing is an inherently dangerous sport and our racetracks are subject to personal injury litigationAlthough we carry jockey accident insurance at each of our racetracks to cover personal jockey injuries which may occur during races or daily workouts, there are certain exclusions to our insurance coverage, and we are still subject to litigation from injured participants.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.  Our results may be affected by the outcome of litigation, as this litigation could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.Ownership and development of real estate requires significant expenditures and is subject to riskOur racing operations require us to own extensive real estate holdings.  All real estate investments are subject to risks including: general economic conditions, such as the availability and cost of financing; local and national real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of residential, office, retail or warehousing space, or a reduction in demand for real estate in the area; governmental regulation, including taxation of property and environmental legislation; and the attractiveness of properties to potential purchasers or tenants.  The real estate industry is also capital intensive and sensitive to interest rates.  Further, significant expenditures, including property taxes, mortgage payments, maintenance costs, insurance costs and related charges, must be made throughout the period of ownership of real property, which expenditures negatively impact our operating results.In addition, we are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws and regulations could hold us responsible for the cost of cleaning up hazardous materials contaminating real property that we own or operate (or previously owned or operated) or properties at which we have disposed of hazardous materials, even if we did not cause the contamination.  If we fail to comply with environmental laws or if contamination is discovered, a court or government agency could impose severe penalties or restrictions on our operations or assess us with the costs of taking remedial actions.Our business depends on utilizing and providing totalizator servicesOur customers utilize information provided by United Tote and other totalizator companies that accumulates wagers, records sales, calculates payoffs and displays wagering data in a secure manner to patrons who wager on our horseraces.  The failure to keep technology current could limit our ability to serve patrons effectively or develop new forms of wagering and/or affect the security of the wagering process, thus affecting patron confidence in our product.  A perceived lack of integrity in the wagering 28Table of Contentssystems could result in a decline in bettor confidence and could lead to a decline in the amount wagered on horseracing.  In addition, a totalizator system failure could cause a considerable loss of revenue if betting machines are unavailable for a significant period of time or during an event with high betting volume.United Tote also has contracts to provide totalizator services to a significant number of racetracks, OTBs and other pari-mutuel wagering businesses.  Its totalizator systems provide wagering data to the industry in a secure manner.  Errors by United Tote technology or personnel may subject us to liabilities, including financial penalties under our totalizator service contracts, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Related to Our Gaming BusinessOur gaming business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessOur gaming operations exist at the discretion of the states where we conduct business, and are subject to extensive state and local regulation. Like all gaming operators in the jurisdictions in which we operate, we must periodically apply to renew our gaming licenses or registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees approved.  While we have obtained all governmental licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our gaming facilities, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals or approvals, or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to continue to operate or to expand our gaming operations.Regulatory authorities also have input into important aspects of our operations, including hours of operation, location or relocation of a facility, numbers and types of machines and loss limits.  Regulators may also levy substantial fines against or seize our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries or the people involved in violating gaming laws or regulations.  Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The high degree of regulation in the gaming industry is a significant obstacle to our growth strategy.Our gaming business faces significant competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur gaming operations operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than our resources.  The gaming industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options.  Our gaming operations also face competition from Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  We do not enjoy the same access to the gaming public or possess the advertising resources that are available to state-sponsored lotteries or other competitors, which may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with them.  Additionally, web-based interactive gaming and wagering is growing rapidly and affecting competition in our industry as federal regulations on web-based activities are clarified.  We anticipate that competition will continue to grow in the web-based interactive gaming and wagering channels because of ease of entry.  In addition, Florida legislators continue to debate the expansion of Florida gaming to include Las Vegas-style destination resort casinos.  Such casinos may be subject to taxation rates lower than the current gaming taxation structure. Should such legislation be enacted, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  See subheading “J. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of gaming industry competition.Our gaming business is geographically concentratedWe conduct our gaming business at four principal locations: Riverwalk in Vicksburg, Mississippi, Harlow’s in Greenville, Mississippi, Calder Casino in Miami Gardens, Florida, and Fair Grounds Slots in New Orleans, Louisiana.  We also operate video poker machines throughout Louisiana through our subsidiary, VSI.  If a business interruption were to occur and continue for a significant length of time at any of our principal gaming operations, or if economic or regulatory conditions were to become unfavorable in one or more of the regions in which they operate, it could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The development of new gaming venues and the expansion of existing facilities is costly and susceptible to delays, cost overruns and other uncertaintiesThe Company may decide to develop, construct and open hotels, casinos or other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise.  Future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets, which could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.29Table of ContentsThe concentration and evolution of the slot machine manufacturing industry or other technological conditions could impose additional costs on usThe majority of our gaming revenues are attributable to slot and video poker machines operated by us at our casinos and wagering facilities.  It is important for competitive reasons that we offer the most popular and up-to-date machine games with the latest technology to our guests.  In recent years, the prices of new machines have escalated faster than the rate of inflation. In recent years, for example, slot machine manufacturers have frequently refused to sell slot machines featuring the most popular games, instead requiring participating lease arrangements in order to acquire the machines.  Participation slot machine leasing arrangements typically require the payment of a fixed daily rental. Such agreements may also include a percentage payment of coin-in or net win.  Generally, a participating lease is substantially more expensive over the long term than the cost to purchase a new machine.  For competitive reasons, we may be forced to purchase new slot machines or enter into participating lease arrangements that are more expensive than the costs associated with the continued operation of our existing slot machines.We materially rely on a variety of hardware and software products to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations.  Technology in the gaming industry is developing rapidly, and we may need to invest substantial amounts to acquire the most current gaming and hotel technology and equipment in order to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate.  We rely on a limited number of vendors to provide video poker and slot machines and any loss of our equipment suppliers could impact our operations. Ensuring the successful implementation and maintenance of any new technology acquired is an additional risk.Risks Related to Our Online BusinessOur ADW business is highly regulated and changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect our businessTwinSpires, our ADW business, accepts advance deposit wagers from customers of certain states who set up and fund an account from which they may place wagers via telephone, mobile device or through the Internet at TwinSpires.com.  The ADW business is heavily regulated, and laws governing advance deposit wagering vary from state to state.  Some states have expressly authorized advance deposit wagering by their own residents, some states have expressly prohibited pari-mutuel wagering and/or advance deposit wagering and other states have expressly authorized pari-mutuel wagering but have neither expressly authorized nor expressly prohibited their residents from placing wagers through advance deposit wagering hubs located in different states.  We believe that an ADW business may open accounts on behalf of and accept wagering instructions from residents of states where pari-mutuel wagering is legal and where providing wagering instructions to ADW businesses in other states is not expressly prohibited by statute, regulations, or other governmental restrictions.  However, state attorneys general, regulators, and other law enforcement officials may interpret state gaming laws, federal statutes, constitutional principles, and doctrines, and the related regulations in a different manner than we do.  In the past, certain state attorneys general and other law enforcement officials have expressed concern over the legality of interstate advance deposit wagering.Our expansion opportunities with respect to advance deposit wagering may be limited unless more states amend their laws or regulations to permit advance deposit wagering.  Conversely, if states take affirmative action to make advance deposit wagering expressly unlawful, this could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For example, previously existing ADW regulation in Illinois expired on December 31, 2012, and we ceased accepting wagers from Illinois residents in January 2013.  In addition, the regulatory and legislative processes can be lengthy, costly and uncertain.  We may not be successful in lobbying state legislatures or regulatory bodies to obtain or renew required legislation, licenses, registrations, permits and approvals necessary to facilitate the operation or expansion of our ADW business.  From time to time, the United States Congress has considered legislation that would either inhibit or restrict Internet gambling in general or inhibit or restrict the use of certain financial instruments, including credit cards, to provide funds for advance deposit wagering.Furthermore, many states have considered and are considering interactive and Internet gaming legislation and regulations, which may inhibit our ability to do business in such states.  Anti-gaming conclusions and recommendations of other governmental or quasi-governmental bodies could form the basis for new laws, regulations, and enforcement policies that could have a material, adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The extensive regulation by both state and federal authorities of gaming activities also can be significantly affected by changes in the political climate and changes in economic and regulatory policies.  Such effects could have a material, adverse impact to the success of our advance deposit wagering operations.Our ADW business is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our businessWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding gaming, consumer protection and intellectual property that are continuously evolving and developing.  The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting.  For example, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions 30Table of Contentsbased on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories.  It is also likely that as our business grows and evolves we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability.  This may require us to expend substantial resources or to modify our online services, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business.It is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the United States and elsewhere that could restrict the online and mobile industries, including player privacy, advertising, taxation, content suitability, copyright, distribution and antitrust.  Furthermore, the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through the Internet and mobile devices.  We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation.  If that were to occur, we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs.  Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of online gaming and impair our business.Our ADW business faces strong competition, and we expect competition levels to increaseOur ADW business is sensitive to changes and improvements to technology and new products and faces strong competition from other web-based interactive gaming and wagering businesses.  Our ability to develop, implement and react to new technology and products for our ADW business is a key factor in our ability to compete with other ADW businesses.  In addition, we face competition from a new wagering product called exchange wagering, a variation of pari-mutuel wagering in which bettors wager directly against one another, establishing their own odds on a horserace.  Both California and New Jersey legislatures have approved exchange wagering.  Some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do.  In addition, we believe that new competitors may enter the ADW business with relative ease because of the low cost of entry.  As a result, we anticipate increased competition in our ADW business.  It is difficult to predict the impact of increased competition on our ADW business.  See subheading “J. Competition” in Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of ADW industry competition.A recent clarification on the impact of the Federal Wire Act of 1961 on Internet gaming could increase competitionDuring 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice clarified its position on the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”), which had historically been interpreted to outlaw all forms of gambling across states lines.  The department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the Wire Act applied only to a sporting event or contest, but did not apply to other forms of Internet gambling, including online betting unrelated to sporting events.  The Justice Department indicated that many forms of online gambling could become legal under federal law, which could include legalized poker and generalized gaming including state lottery wagering.  As a result, we anticipate increased competition to our ADW business from various other forms of online gaming.  It is difficult to predict the level of increased competition and the impact of increased competition on our ADW business.Our inability to retain our core customer base or our failure to attract new customers could harm our businessWe utilize technology and marketing relationships to retain current customers and attract new customers.  If we are unable to retain our core customer base through robust content offerings and other popular features, if we lose customers to our competitors, or if we fail to attract new customers, our businesses would fail to grow or would be adversely affected.System failures or damage from earthquakes, fires, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber-attack or other unforeseen events could harm our businessOur ADW business depends upon our communications hardware and our computer hardware.  We have built certain redundancies into our systems to avoid downtime in the event of outages, system failures or damage; however, certain risks still exist.  Thus, our systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist cyber-attacks, hardware or software error, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.  Any unscheduled interruption in the availability of our website and our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenue.  Interruptions in our services or a breach of customers’ secure data could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our site, and could permanently harm our reputation and brand.  These interruptions also increase the burden on our engineering staff, which, 31Table of Contentsin turn, could delay our introduction of new features and services on our website.  We have property and business interruption insurance covering damage or interruption of our systems.  However, this insurance might not be sufficient to compensate us for all losses that may occur.Security breaches, computer viruses and computer hacking attacks could harm our business and results of operationsSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent in our industry.  Many companies, including ours, have been the target of such attacks.  Any security breach caused by hacking, which involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems, or to cause intentional malfunctions or loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment, and the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Though it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure to the satisfaction of our players may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing players and attract new players.We carry insurance covering many of these risks, including network security, first party extortion threats and business interruptions, but there are certain exclusions to this coverage and the insurance limits may not be sufficient to fully mitigate all financial damage to the Company.  We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis.  The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.We may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes in a timely manner, which may cause customer dissatisfactionThe gaming sector is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and continuous introduction of new products.  Our main technological advantage versus potential competitors is our software lead-time in the market and our experience in operating an Internet-based wagering network.  However, we may not be able to maintain our competitive technological position against current and potential competitors, especially those with greater financial resources.  Our success depends upon new product development and technological advancements, including the development of new wagering platforms and features.  While we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development and product enhancement, we may not be able to continue to improve and market our existing products or technologies or develop and market new products in a timely manner.  Further technological developments may cause our products or technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive"
