3,RHI,ROBERT HALF INTL INC,2024-02-20,"    Risk Factors
The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:Risks Related to the Company’s Business EnvironmentAny reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business and financial condition. The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its talent solutions services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. In the recent past, certain of the Company’s markets experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment, limited availability of credit, significant inflation and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas, and the expanding conflict throughout the Middle East have caused significant economic, market, political or regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company’s markets. Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company’s markets could reduce demand for the Company’s services.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results. As a provider of contract and permanent talent solutions as well as consulting services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants. The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants. If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants, or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company faces risks in operating internationally. The Company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, international hostilities and responses to those hostilities, the burden of complying with various potentially conflicting foreign laws, technical standards, unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Company’s business. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease. For example, in 2023, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar, as well as weakened against the Euro, British Pound and Brazilian Real, the net of which resulted in a nominal impact to the Company’s revenues.Natural disasters and unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, the Company is subject to numerous risks outside of the Company’s control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. Historically, the Company’s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location. Any public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, coronavirus, or even a particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for the Company’s services and the Company’s ability to offer them. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change, which may increase the Company’s expenses, exacerbate other risks to the Company, and affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to a decreased ability to offer the Company’s services and materially adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. In addition, these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants, the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically, the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events, and disruption to the Company’s information systems. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business and financial condition.6Failure to meet ESG commitments could harm the Company’s reputation.  The Company has public environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) commitments, including environmental targets designed to have a positive impact on climate. The Company’s ability to achieve these goals is subject to a multitude of risks that may be outside of the Company’s control. The Company’s failure or perceived failure to achieve ESG goals or maintain ESG practices that meet evolving stakeholder expectations could harm the Company’s reputation, adversely impact the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees or clients, and expose the Company to increased scrutiny from the investment community and enforcement authorities. The Company’s reputation also may be harmed by the perceptions that clients, employees and other stakeholders have about the Company’s action or inaction on social, ethical, or political issues. Damage to the Company’s reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for the Company’s services and thus have an adverse effect on future financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild the Company’s reputation and restore the value of the brands and could also reduce the Company’s stock price.Risks Related to the Company’s OperationsThe Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its talent solutions business. The Company’s talent solutions services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek contract or permanent positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Unemployment in the U.S. has been at historic lows in recent periods and competition for workers in a number of industries is intense. When unemployment levels are low, finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands is more challenging. Although unemployment has risen in some areas in which the Company operates, talent shortages have persisted in a number of disciplines and jurisdictions. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share. The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients. The Company’s contract talent solutions business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some of the Company’s temporary workers are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to the Company’s clients. If cybersecurity incidents were to occur in such a way, the Company may face legal and contractual liability, reputational damage, loss of business, and other expenses. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of damages caused by temporary employees acting on phishing emails and cyber attacks and other errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of compromise of client confidential information. In some cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect on the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect on the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations. As with the Company’s talent solutions services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “Big Four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services, and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel, and other requirements to successfully compete.7Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability. The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Protiviti risks liability from allegations of damages caused by errors, omissions or misconduct by its employees working on consulting engagements or from damages caused by its employees acting on phishing emails and cyber attacks, or allegations of compromise of client confidential information. In some cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims. Liability could be incurred, or litigation could be, and from time-to-time has been, instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees, and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business. The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success. A failure to retain key management personnel could disrupt the Company’s succession strategy, hindering a smooth transition to new leadership and potentially disrupting the Company’s operations. The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of its clients. The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are impacting industries served by all the Company’s lines of business. In addition, the Company’s business relies on a variety of technologies, including those that support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and keep pace with industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The Company uses artificial intelligence in its services which may result in operational challenges, legal liability, reputational concerns and privacy and competitive risks. The Company currently uses and intends to leverage its own and third parties’ artificial intelligence (“AI”) processes and algorithms and its own evolving and third parties’ cognitive, analytical and artificial intelligence applications in its daily operations for Protiviti and talent solutions, including by deploying generative AI into the Company’s talent solutions search operations. Protiviti expanded its service offerings to include AI risk analysis, policy creation, governance, and technology selection and architecture. The use of AI by talent solutions and provision of AI related services by Protiviti may result in operational challenges, legal liability, reputational concerns and privacy and competitive risks which could result in adverse effects to the Company’s financial condition, results or reputation. Generative AI products and services leverage existing and widely available technologies, such as Chat GPT-4 and its successors, or alternative large language models or other processes. The use of generative AI processes at scale is relatively new and may lead to challenges, concerns and risks that are significant or that the Company may not be able to predict, especially if its use of these technologies in the delivery of its services becomes more important to its operations over time.Use of generative AI in search operations and services offerings may be difficult to deploy successfully due to operational issues inherent to the nature of such technologies. AI algorithms use machine learning and predictive analytics, which may lead to flawed, biased, and inaccurate candidate and lead generation search results. Datasets in AI training, development, or operations may be insufficient, of poor quality, reflect unwanted forms of bias, or raise other legal concerns (such as concerns regarding copyright protections or data protection). Inappropriate or controversial data practices by, or practices reflecting inherent biases of, data scientists, engineers, and end-users of the Company’s systems could lead to mistrust, rejection or skepticism of the Company’s services by clients and candidates.Further, unauthorized use or misuse of AI by the Company’s employees, vendors or others may result in disclosure of confidential company and customer data, reputational harm, privacy law violations and legal liability. The Company’s use of AI may also lead to novel and urgent cybersecurity risks, including access to or the misuse of personal data, all of which may adversely affect its operations and reputation.Uncertainty in the legal regulatory regime relating to AI may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with U.S. and non-U.S. laws, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time. Several jurisdictions around the globe, including Europe and certain U.S. states, have already proposed or enacted laws governing AI. For example, European regulators have proposed stringent AI regulations and laws, and the Company expects other jurisdictions will adopt similar legislation. Other jurisdictions may decide to adopt similar or more restrictive legislation that may render the use of such technologies challenging, impossible or financially prohibitive.8The demand for the Company’s services related to regulatory compliance may decline. The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley, Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 reviews, and other regulatory compliance services. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act, signed into law in April of 2012, allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly, from time-to-time proposals are considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Demand for the Company’s services from government and public sector clients may decrease over time. In recent periods, the Company reported increased business from services rendered to the public sector due to, among other developments, the volume of unemployment claims and housing assistance claims, as well as the demands faced by public school districts. With the majority of COVID-19 legal restrictions lifted, many of the COVID-19 related projects have ended and the Company’s public sector business has shifted to different projects with public sector clients. It is unknown whether the shift in projects with state, local and other public sector clients will ultimately maintain the same level of business or to what extent business with the public sector may decrease as the effects of the pandemic lessen or change over time. Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Additionally, the Company’s clients will frequently enter nonexclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting the Company’s future results.If the Company does not effectively manage billable rates, the Company’s  financial results could suffer.  Accurate and strategic pricing represents a key factor in our financial results. If billable rates are too low, the Company’s service revenues may not cover operational costs whereas if billable rates are too high, the Company risks hindering client retention and limits competitiveness. Legal and Regulatory RisksThe Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities. The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. The Company is defending several claims brought under the California Labor Code Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”), which authorizes individuals to file lawsuits to seek civil penalties on behalf of themselves and other employees for alleged labor code violations, and the Washington Equal Pay and Opportunities Act which relates to disclosures within job postings. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions, or to various other claims, disputes, and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any future lawsuits, claims, disputes, or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.9The countries in which the Company operates may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services. Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business. The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s contract talent  services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, PAGA litigation in California alleging wage and hour and other Labor code compliance issues, and litigation in Washington relating to compliance with the Washington Equal Pay and Opportunities Act. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings. An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.If the Company fails to comply with Anti-Bribery Laws, anti-forced labor laws, or economic sanction regulations, it could be subject to substantial fines or other penalties and reputational harm. In many parts of the world, including countries in which the Company operates and/or seeks to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations (“Anti-Bribery Laws”). These laws generally prohibit companies, their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting or accepting, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in the public or private sector. In addition, some of these laws have accounting provisions that require the Company to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable Anti-Bribery Laws could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil and/or criminal penalties, debarment from business dealings with certain governments or government agencies or restrictions on the marketing of the Company’s products in certain countries, and damage to the Company’s reputation, which could harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other relevant agencies of the U.S. government administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, from conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals, subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Similar economic sanctions are imposed by the European Union and other jurisdictions. The Company’s international operations subject it to these and other laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict the Company’s business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities and individuals, and are constantly changing. Penalties for noncompliance with these complex laws and regulations can be significant and include substantial fines, sanctions or civil and/or criminal penalties, and violations can result in adverse publicity, which could harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws, U.S. export control laws, economic sanctions, anti-forced labor and other laws and regulations, the Company cannot be 10sure that its employees, agents or other third parties will not violate such policies or applicable laws and regulations. Any such violations could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, prohibitions on the conduct of its business, and materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of the Company’s senior management.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s contract staffing operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) were signed into law in the U.S. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its contract talent in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate.The U.S. Congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the PPACA and in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard an appeal of a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that invalidated significant portions of the PPACA. It is unclear at this point what the scope of any such future legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding proposed replacement health care reform legislation or any modifications to such legislation to deal with these court challenges, the Company cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years, and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase. U.S. federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the Company. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of these changes on the Company’s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the TCJA are implemented. In addition, various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the TCJA which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the Company’s results of operations.Risks Related to the Company’s Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data ProtectionCompany and third-party computer, technology and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access, and disruption that could expose the Company to material operational, financial, and reputational damage (including the unauthorized access to, or exposure of, personal and confidential information and intellectual property). The Company’s ability to manage its operations using these systems successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its and third parties’ computer, technology and communications systems, some of which are managed and run by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary systems (and, as a result, its operations) are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer, technology and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events, and errors in usage by the Company’s or its vendors’ employees and contractors. In addition, the Company’s systems contain personal and confidential information and intellectual property, including information of importance to the Company, and its employees, vendors, contractors, and clients.Cyberattacks, including attacks motivated by the desire for monetary gain, embarrassment, geopolitics, and grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, could potentially disable or damage its systems or the systems of its vendors or clients, or allow unauthorized access to, or exposure of, intellectual property and personal or confidential information, including information about employees, vendors, candidates, contractors and clients. The Company’s security tools, controls and practices, including those relating to identity and access management, credential strength, and the security tools, controls and practices of its vendors and clients, may not prevent or detect access, damage or disruption to Company or third-party computer, technology, and communications hardware and software systems or the unauthorized access to, or exposure of, intellectual property or personal or confidential information. A failure to prevent or detect unauthorized access to Company or third-party systems could expose the Company to material operational, financial, and reputational damage. There are many approaches through which such systems could be damaged or disrupted, or information exposed or accessed, including through system vulnerabilities, configuration errors, vendor vulnerabilities, failing to patch or upgrade systems, social engineering, cyberattacks, improperly obtaining and using user credentials, malfeasance or the misuse of authorized user access. Periodic and continuous assessments are conducted by the Company to identify security risks, vulnerabilities, weaknesses or gaps, and a risk-based approach is then employed to address them, recognizing that not all risks or vulnerabilities, weaknesses or gaps can be eliminated in an economical or timely manner. This risk-based approach prioritizes risks, vulnerabilities, weaknesses and gaps based on, among other factors, budgetary constraints, impact, likelihood of mitigation, and the broader risk landscape. No security program can offer a guarantee against all potential incidents. On an increasing frequency, the Company and its third-party vendors experience security incidents that have resulted in unauthorized access to the Company’s or its third-11party vendors’ computer, technology and communications hardware and software systems. To date, no such incidents have been determined to have had a material impact on the Company.  The Company has transitioned a significant number of the Company’s employee population to remote work. This transition to remote working has also increased the Company’s vulnerability to risks related to the Company’s computer, technology, and communications hardware and software systems and has exacerbated certain related risks, including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks. The damage or disruption to Company or third-party systems, or unauthorized access to, or exposure of, intellectual property or personal or confidential information, could harm the Company’s operations, reputation and brand, resulting in a loss of business or revenue. It could also subject the Company to government sanctions, litigation from candidates, contractors, clients, and employees, and legal liability under its contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The Company may also incur additional expenses, including the cost of remediating incidents or improving security measures, the cost of identifying and retaining replacement vendors, increased costs of insurance, or ransomware payments. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. Furthermore, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings. Any future events impacting the Company or its third-party vendors that damages or interrupts the Company’s or its third-party vendors’ computer, technology, and communications hardware and software systems or exposes intellectual property or data or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation, and financial results.Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information (and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations) could increase the Company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations, financial results, and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects, uses, and retains personal information from its clients, employees, candidates, and contractors, including, without limitation, full names, government-issued identification numbers, addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, and payroll-related information. The possession and use of personal information in conducting the Company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, imposes specific operational requirements for entities processing personal information, including requirements for data transfers to certain countries outside the European Union, and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data storage, use, transfer, residency, privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention, while any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations, financial results and reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Internal Controls and Accounting PoliciesFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel and processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.Failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. Although the Company has processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner, the Company’s efforts may not be sufficient. The collective impact of the tone at the top, tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management, compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues, particularly those affecting core operations. The Company’s processes, corporate culture and general ethical climate may not be sufficient to ensure timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues.Risks Associated With the Effects of Climate Change           The Company may be adversely affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such change. The physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business. To the 12extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, certain regions where the Company operates could experience increases in storm intensity, extreme temperatures, wildfires, rising sea-levels and/or drought. Over time, these conditions could result in increases in our operating costs or business interruptions. For example, our headquarters is located in an area of California where the incidence of wildfire has increased over time and may continue to increase. In addition, in 2023 the Company established certain emissions targets and other environmental goals and submitted them for validation to the Science Based Target initiative (“SBTi”). Failure to achieve such goals, or a perception (whether valid or invalid) of our failure to achieve such goals, could result in market, reputational, regulatory or liability risks, client dissatisfaction, reduced revenue and profitability or shareholder lawsuits. If the Company is unable to achieve our environmental goals, our business and reputation may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business"
9,RHI,ROBERT HALF INTL INC,2023-02-10,"    Risk Factors
The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:Risks Related to the Company’s Business EnvironmentAny reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business and financial condition. The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its talent solutions services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. In the recent past, certain of the Company’s markets experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment, limited availability of credit, significant inflation and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including the spread of COVID-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, have caused significant economic, market, political or regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company’s markets. Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company’s markets could reduce demand for the Company’s services.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results. As a provider of contract and permanent talent solutions as well as consulting services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants. The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants. If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants, or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company faces risks in operating internationally. The Company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, international hostilities and responses to those hostilities, the burden of complying with various potentially conflicting foreign laws, technical standards, unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the performance of the Company’s business. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease. For example, in 2022, the Company’s revenues were unfavorably impacted by currency exchange rates as the U.S. dollar strengthened against the Euro and British pound.The outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) in 2020 impacted demand for the Company’s services, disrupted the Company’s operations, and may continue to do so. The COVID-19 outbreak emerged as a serious threat to the health and economic well-being of the Company’s clients, candidates, employees, and the overall economy. At various times during the outbreak, many counties, states and countries took dramatic action including, without limitation, ordering all nonessential workers to stay home, mandating the closure of schools and nonessential business premises, and imposing isolation measures on large portions of the population. These measures, while intended to protect human life, had serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and may do so in the future if they are reintroduced. The emergence of new variants of the coronavirus or of other illnesses may cause a rapid deterioration of economic conditions and the financial and credit markets, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. While the Company has navigated the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, its continuation or worsening may have a negative impact on the Company’s business.Natural disasters and unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect the Company’s business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, the Company is subject to numerous risks outside of the Company’s control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect the Company’s business and financial performance. Historically, the Company’s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location. Any public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, coronavirus, or even a 6particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for the Company's services and the Company's ability to offer them. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change, which may increase the Company's expenses, exacerbate other risks to the Company, and affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to a decreased ability to offer the Company's services and materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations. In addition, these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants, the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically, the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events, and disruption to the Company's information systems. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect the Company's reputation, business and financial condition.Risks Related to the Company’s OperationsThe Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its talent solutions business. The Company’s talent solutions services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek contract or  permanent positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment in the U.S. was at historic lows and during the second half of 2021, as the economy recovered, competition for workers in a number of industries became intense. When unemployment levels are low, finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands is more challenging. Although unemployment has risen in some areas in which the Company operates, talent shortages have persisted in a number of disciplines and jurisdictions. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share. The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients. The Company’s contract talent solutions business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some of the Company’s temporary workers are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to the Company’s clients. If cybersecurity incidents were to occur in such a way, the Company may face legal and contractual liability, reputational damage, loss of business, and other expenses. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information. In some cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees, and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business. The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of its clients. The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are impacting industries served by all the Company's lines of business. In addition, the Company’s business relies on a variety of technologies, including those that support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and keep pace with industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in 7response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The demand for the Company’s services related to regulatory compliance may decline. The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley, Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 reviews, and other regulatory compliance services. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act, signed into law in April of 2012, allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly, from time-to-time proposals are considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Demand for the Company’s services from government and public sector clients related to the COVID-19 pandemic may decrease over time. During 2021 and 2022 the Company reported increased business from services rendered to the public sector during the pandemic due to, among other developments, the volume of unemployment claims and housing assistance claims, as well as the demands faced by public school districts that must meet the technical support requirements of virtual learning models. With the majority of COVID-19 legal restrictions lifted, many of the COVID-19 related projects have ended and the Company's public sector business has shifted to different projects with public sector clients. It is unknown whether the shift in projects with state, local and other public sector clients will ultimately maintain the same level of business or to what extent  business with the public sector may decrease as the effects of the pandemic lessen or change over time. The future impact of the pandemic and its effects on the needs of the Company’s clients are impossible to fully predict, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s increased business in the public sector will be sustained.Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Additionally, the Company’s clients will frequently enter nonexclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting the Company's future results.Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. Protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified, skilled personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “Big Four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services, and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel, and other requirements to successfully compete.Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability. The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred, or litigation could be, and from time-to-time has been, instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company.Legal and Regulatory RisksThe Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities. The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its 8subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions, or to various other claims, disputes, and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any future lawsuits, claims, disputes, or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.The countries in which we operate may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services. Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business. The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s contract talent  services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings. An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.If the Company fails to comply with Anti-Bribery Laws, anti-forced labor laws, or economic sanction regulations, it could be subject to substantial fines or other penalties and reputational harm. In many parts of the world, including countries in which the Company operates and/or seeks to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations (“Anti-Bribery Laws”). These laws generally prohibit companies, their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting or accepting, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in the public or private sector. In addition, some of these laws have accounting provisions that require the Company to maintain accurate books and records and a system of 9internal accounting controls. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable Anti-Bribery Laws could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil and/or criminal penalties, debarment from business dealings with certain governments or government agencies or restrictions on the marketing of the Company’s products in certain countries, and damage to the Company's reputation, which could harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other relevant agencies of the U.S. government administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, from conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals, subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Similar economic sanctions are imposed by the European Union and other jurisdictions. The Company’s international operations subject it to these and other laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict the Company’s business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities and individuals, and are constantly changing. Penalties for noncompliance with these complex laws and regulations can be significant and include substantial fines, sanctions or civil and/or criminal penalties, and violations can result in adverse publicity, which could harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws, economic sanctions, anti-forced labor and other laws and regulations, the Company cannot be sure that its employees, agents or other third parties will not violate such policies or applicable laws and regulations. Any such violations could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, prohibitions on the conduct of its business, and materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of the Company’s senior management.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s contract staffing operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) was signed into law in the U.S. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its contract talent in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate.The U.S. Congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the PPACA and in 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard an appeal of a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that invalidated significant portions of the PPACA. It is unclear at this point what the scope of any such future legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding proposed replacement health care reform legislation or any modifications to such legislation to deal with these court challenges, the Company cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years, and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase. Risks Related to the Company’s Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data ProtectionCompany and third-party computer, technology and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access, and disruption that could expose the Company to material operational, financial, and reputational damage (including the unauthorized access to, or exposure of, personal and confidential information). The Company’s ability to manage its operations through the use of these systems successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer, technology and communications systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary systems (and, as a result its operations) are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer, technology and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events, and errors in usage by the Company’s or its vendors’ employees and contractors. In addition, the Company’s systems contain personal and confidential information, including information of importance to the Company, and its employees, vendors, contractors, and clients.Cyberattacks, including attacks motivated by the desire for monetary gain, geopolitics, grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems or the systems of its vendors or clients, or allow unauthorized access to, or exposure of, personal or confidential information, including information about employees, vendors, candidates, contractors and clients. The Company’s security tools, controls and practices, including those relating to identity and access management, credential strength, and the security tools, controls and practices of its vendors and clients, may not prevent access, damage or disruption to Company or third-party systems or the unauthorized access to, exposure of, personal or confidential information. There are many approaches through which such systems could be damaged or disrupted, or information exposed or accessed, including through system vulnerabilities, improperly obtaining and using user credentials or the misuse of authorized user access. In the past, the Company and its third-party vendors have experienced other data security incidents resulting from unauthorized access to the Company's systems and other fraudulent activities. 10The Company has transitioned a significant number of the Company’s employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This transition to remote working has also increased the Company’s vulnerability to risks related to the Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems and exacerbated certain related risks, including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks. The damage or disruption to Company or third-party systems, or unauthorized access to, or exposure of, personal or confidential information, could harm the Company’s operations, reputation and brand, resulting in a loss of business or revenue. It could also subject the Company to government sanctions, litigation from candidates, contractors, clients, and employees, and legal liability under its contracts, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The Company may also incur additional expenses, such as the cost of remediating incidents or improving security measures, the cost of identifying and retaining replacement vendors, increased costs of insurance, or ransomware payments. Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. Furthermore, the potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings. Any future events impacting the Company or its third-party vendors that damages or interrupts the Company's or its third party vendors’ systems or exposes data or other confidential information could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation, and financial results.Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information (and the failure to comply with such laws and regulations) could increase the Company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations, financial results, and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects, uses, and retains personal information from its clients, employees, employment candidates, and contractors, including, without limitation, full names, government-issued identification numbers, addresses, birthdates, and payroll-related information. The possession and use of personal information in conducting the Company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, which, in many cases, apply not only to third-party transfers, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, imposes specific operational requirements for entities processing personal information, including requirements for data transfers to certain countries outside the European Union, and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer, residency, privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention, while any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations, financial results and reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Internal Controls and Accounting PoliciesFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.Failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Although the Company has processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner, the Company's efforts may not be sufficient. The collective impact of the tone at the top, tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management, compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues, particularly those affecting core operations. The Company’s processes, corporate culture and general ethical climate may not be sufficient to ensure timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues.Risks Associated With the Effects of Climate ChangeThe physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our operations and business. To the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, certain regions where we operate could experience increases in storm intensity, extreme temperatures, wildfires, rising sea-levels and/or drought. Over time, these conditions could result in increases in our operating costs or business interruptions. For example, our headquarters is located in an area of California where the incidence of wildfire has increased over time and may continue to increase. There can be no assurance that climate change will 11not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business. In addition, we are in the process of establishing  certain emissions targets and other environmental goals. Failure to achieve such goals, or a perception (whether valid or invalid) of our failure to achieve such goals, could result in market, reputational, regulatory or liability risks, client dissatisfaction, reduced revenue and profitability or shareholder lawsuits. If we are unable to achieve our environmental goals, our business and reputation may be adversely affected.General Risk Factors
U.S. federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the Company. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of these changes on the Company’s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the TCJA are implemented. In addition, various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the TCJA which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the Company’s results of operations"
6,RHI,ROBERT HALF INTL INC,2022-02-14,"    Risk Factors
The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:Risks Related to the Company’s Business EnvironmentAny reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business and financial condition. The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. In the recent past, certain of the Company’s markets experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including the spread of COVID-19 and the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”), have caused significant economic, market, political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company’s markets. Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company’s markets could reduce demand for the Company’s services.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results. As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants. The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants. If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company faces risks in operating internationally. The Company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign 5countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease. The value of the U.S. dollar has recently weakened against a number of major foreign currencies, but an increase in strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the Company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets, when translated into U.S. dollars, to decline. Significant U.K. or European developments stemming from the U.K.’s decision to withdraw from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In the past several years, the European market experienced economic uncertainty, which adversely affected, and the return of which may in the future adversely affect, the Company’s operations in Europe. In particular, Brexit has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions. To the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in Europe (related to Brexit or otherwise) worsen, demand for the Company’s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. The currently evolving situation of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) has impacted demand for the Company’s services, disrupted the Company’s operations and may continue to do so. The COVID-19 outbreak emerged as a serious threat to the health and economic well-being of the Company’s clients, candidates, employees, and the overall economy. At various times during the outbreak, many counties, states and countries took dramatic action including, without limitation, ordering all nonessential workers to stay home, mandating the closure of schools and nonessential business premises and imposing isolation measures on large portions of the population. These measures, while intended to protect human life, had serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and may do so in the future if they are continued or reintroduced.   The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant uncertainty and volatility in the Company’s business. Initially it caused a dramatic increase in unemployment in the United States and in certain other regions in which the Company operates, and mandated business closures and slowing economic activity reduced the use of temporary workers and reduced businesses’ recruitment of new employees resulting in less demand for the Company’s services. During 2021, however, demand for workers and the Company’s services increased significantly as economic activity recovered, worksites reopened, and many business sought to restore or expand workforces that had shrunk during the course of the pandemic. There can be no assurance, however, that this increased demand for workers and the Company’s services will be sustained. Furthermore, the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus or of other illnesses may cause a rapid deterioration of economic conditions and the financial and credit markets, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company has transitioned a significant number of the Company’s employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This transition to remote working and the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct the Company’s business and the business and operations of the Company’s third-party service providers who perform critical services for the Company’s business. This transition to remote working has also increased the Company’s vulnerability to risks related to the Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems and exacerbated certain related risks, including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks.The Company is continuing to monitor the spread of COVID-19, including the emerging variants of the disease, and related risks, including risks related to efforts to mitigate the disease’s spread. The rapid development and fluidity of the situation, however, precludes any prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. The emergence of new variants of the coronavirus or of other illnesses may adversely impact global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn that would likely impact demand for the Company’s services. While the Company has navigated the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, its continuation or worsening may have a negative impact on the Company’s business.Any of the above factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase the Company’s costs, severely negatively impact the Company’s revenue, net income, and other results of operations, and impact the Company’s liquidity position. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted, and such impacts may also have the effect of heightening many of the other material risks the Company faces. Natural disasters and unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, the Company is subject to numerous risks outside of the Company's control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect the 6Company's business and financial performance. Historically, the Company’s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location. Any public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, coronavirus, or even a particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for the Company's services and the Company's ability to offer them. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions may increase in frequency or severity due to climate change and can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to decreased ability to offer the Company's services and materially adversely affect the Company's short-term results of operations. In addition, these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants, the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically, the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events and disruption to the Company's information systems. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect the Company's reputation, business and financial condition.Risks Related to the Company’s OperationsThe Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business. The Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment in the United States was at historic lows and during the second half of 2021, as the economy recovered, competition for workers in a number of industries became intense. When unemployment levels are low, finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands is more challenging. At various times during the pandemic, this challenge has been exacerbated by the withdrawal of some workers from the labor pool, whether due to health concerns, school and daycare closures or other reasons. Any resurgence of COVID-19 may adversely impact the Company's ability to recruit sufficient candidates for certain industries or regions in which the Company operates. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share. The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients. The Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. Furthermore, as the employer of record for some individuals who have been placed in client workplaces where exposure to COVID-19 is possible, the Company may be subject to risk of liability should such employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some of the Company’s temporary workers are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to the Company’s clients for which they may hold the Company liable. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information. In some cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business. The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of 7its clients. The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are impacting industries served by all the Company's lines of business. In addition, the Company’s business relies on a variety of technologies, including those that support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The demand for the Company’s services related to regulatory compliance may decline. The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley, Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 reviews (""AML""), and other regulatory compliance services. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup (“JOBS”) Act, signed into law in April of 2012, allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly, a number of proposals have been recently or are currently being considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Demand for the Company’s services from government and public sector clients related to the COVID-19 pandemic may decrease over time. The Company has reported increased business from services rendered to the public sector during the pandemic due to, among other developments, the volume of unemployment claims and housing assistance claims, as well as the demands faced by public school districts that must meet the technical support requirements of virtual learning models.  Additional business with public sector clients not directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic has been reported in 2021. The pandemic-related services and other work for public sector clients has contributed to the Company's revenue over the past year. It is unknown to what extent business with state, local and other public sector clients may decrease as the effects of the pandemic lessen or change over time. Demand for the Company’s services from government and public sector clients may also fall as clients adapt to the effects of the pandemic and their needs evolve. The Company will continue to monitor the situation, but the future impact of the pandemic and its effects on the needs of the Company’s clients are impossible to fully predict, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s increased business in the public sector will be sustained.Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Additionally, the Company’s clients will frequently enter nonexclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting the Company's future results.Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. Protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified, skilled personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations. Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel and other requirements to successfully compete.Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability. The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred, or litigation could be instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company.Legal and Regulatory RisksThe Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities. The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the 8Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions, or to various other claims, disputes, and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any future lawsuits, claims, disputes, or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.Government imposed vaccine mandates could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In September 2021, President Biden announced two executive orders related to vaccine mandates that would impact the Company's operations in the United States.  The first executive order-- the OSHA Vaccination and Testing Emergency Temporary Standard (“ETS”) — was blocked by a stay of enforcement by the United States Supreme Court on January 13, 2022.  On January 25, 2022, the Department of Labor withdrew the ETS; however, OSHA could still pursue a vaccine mandate through the regular federal rulemaking process. A second Executive Order on Ensuring Adequate COVID-19 Safety Protocols for Federal Contractors (“EO 14042”) would apply to the Company as a federal contractor and subcontractor. EO 14042 is also subject to legal challenges and is currently subject to a nationwide injunction during the pendency of federal court proceedings.  At this time, it is unclear, among other things, if or when any federal vaccine mandates may go into effect.  Further, state and local governments in the United States and in international jurisdictions where we operate may implement vaccine mandates (currently New York City has a mandate) and it is not clear if such mandates will go into effect, or stay in effect; whether any will apply to all employees or only to employees who work in the office; and how compliance will be documented.  Should such mandates apply to us, we may be required to implement a requirement that all of our employees get vaccinated, subject to limited exceptions. At this time, Protiviti has implemented a vaccine requirement for its operations; however, the Company’s staffing operations do not have a vaccine requirement. Currently, it is not possible to predict the impact that a federal vaccine mandate, any other vaccine mandate, or a vaccine requirement should we elect to adopt one, will have on us or on our workforce. Any vaccine requirement or vaccine mandate, if implemented, may result in employee attrition; however, any failure to implement a vaccine requirement or mandate may also result in employee attrition or resistance to returning to onsite work, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.The countries in which we operate may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services. Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business. The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign 9countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings. An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.If the Company fails to comply with Anti-Bribery Laws or economic sanction regulations, it could be subject to substantial fines or other penalties.  In many parts of the world, including countries in which the Company operates and/or seeks to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations (“Anti-Bribery Laws”). These laws generally prohibit companies, their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting or accepting, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in the public or private sector. In addition, the FCPA’s accounting provisions require the Company to maintain accurate books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable Anti-Bribery Laws could result in substantial fines, sanctions or civil and/or criminal penalties, debarment from business dealings with certain governments or government agencies or restrictions on the marketing of the Company’s products in certain countries, which could harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other relevant agencies of the U.S. government administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, from conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals, subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Similar economic sanctions are imposed by the European Union and other jurisdictions.  The Company’s international operations subject it to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict the Company’s business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities and individuals, and are constantly changing. Penalties for noncompliance with these complex laws and regulations can be significant and include substantial fines, sanctions or civil and/or criminal penalties, and violations can result in adverse publicity, which could harm the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws, economic sanctions, and other laws and regulations, the Company cannot be sure that its employees, agents or other third parties will not violate such policies or applicable laws and regulations. Any such violations could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, prohibitions on the conduct of its business, and materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, detecting, investigating and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of the Company’s senior management.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s temporary staffing operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) was signed into law in the United States. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate.The U.S. Congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the PPACA and in 2020, the United States Supreme Court heard an appeal of a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that invalidated significant portions of the PPACA. It is unclear at this point what the scope of any such future legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding proposed replacement health care reform legislation or any modifications to such legislation to deal with these court challenges, the Company cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. 10Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years, and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase. Risks Related to the Company’s Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data ProtectionThe Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption. The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees and those of the Company’s vendors. The Company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyberattacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company’s security controls or those of its third-party vendors over personal and other data, and other practices it follows, may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information. Such disclosure or damage to the Company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings.Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the Company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects, uses, and retains personal information from its employees, employment candidates, and contractors, including, without limitation, full names, government-issued identification numbers, addresses, birthdates, and payroll-related information. The possession and use of personal information in conducting the Company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, protection and security, which, in many cases, apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information, such as strong safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the European Union and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer, residency, privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention, while any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Internal Controls and Accounting PoliciesFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.Failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.  Although the Company has processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner, the Company's efforts may not be sufficient. The collective impact of the tone at the top, tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management, compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues, particularly those affecting core operations. The Company’s processes, corporate culture and general ethical climate may not be sufficient to ensure timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues.11General Risk Factors
U.S. federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the Company.  On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law.  Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of these changes on the Company’s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the TCJA are implemented. In addition, various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the TCJA which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the Company’s results of operations"
7,RHI,ROBERT HALF INTL INC,2021-02-12,"    Risk Factors
The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:Risks Related to the Company’s Business EnvironmentAny reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business and financial condition. The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. Certain of the Company’s markets have recently experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including ongoing trade negotiations and the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”), have caused significant economic, market, political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company’s markets. Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company’s markets could reduce demand for the Company’s services.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results. As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants. The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants. If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company faces risks in operating internationally. The Company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease. The value of the U.S. dollar has recently weakened against a number of major foreign currencies, but an increase in strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the Company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets, when translated into U.S. dollars, to decline. Significant U.K. or European developments stemming from the U.K.’s decision to withdraw from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In the past several years, the European market experienced economic uncertainty, which adversely affected, and the return of which may in the future adversely affect, the Company’s operations in Europe. In particular, Brexit has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions. To the 5extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in Europe (related to Brexit or otherwise) worsen, demand for the Company’s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. The currently evolving situation of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (""COVID-19"") has impacted demand for the Company’s services, disrupted the Company’s operations and may continue to do so. The COVID-19 outbreak has emerged as a serious threat to the health and economic well-being of the Company’s clients,  candidates, employees, and the overall economy. Since the beginning of the outbreak, many counties, states and countries have taken dramatic action including, without limitation, ordering all non-essential workers to stay home, mandating the closure of schools and non-essential business premises and imposing isolation measures on large portions of the population. These measures, while intended to protect human life, have had serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies and the severity and the duration of these is highly uncertain. The effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts, including proposed government payments to affected citizens and industries, continue to be uncertain and many economists are predicting extended local or global recessions. The accelerating number of deaths and hospitalizations resulting from this disease are further exacerbating the uncertainties and challenges facing the Company’s business. Actions intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have caused a dramatic increase in unemployment in the United States and in certain other regions in which the Company operates and created significant uncertainty and volatility in the Company’s business. Mandated business closures and slowing economic activity have reduced use of temporary workers and reduced businesses’ recruitment of new employees resulting in less demand for the Company’s services, which may in the future materially harm the Company’s business and financial condition. Many of the Company’s clients have or may be required to or choose to voluntarily close their worksites and the Company has at various times during the pandemic witnessed a significant drop in the demand of the Company’s services by clients, particularly the Company’s recruiting and temporary staffing clients, most of whom are small and midsize businesses that are feeling the crisis. Deterioration in economic conditions or the financial or credit markets could also have an adverse impact on the Company’s clients’ ability to pay for services the Company has already provided. Furthermore, the spread of COVID-19 may adversely impact the Company’s ability to recruit sufficient candidates for certain industries or regions in which the Company operates. The Company has transitioned a significant number of the Company’s corporate employee population to a remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This transition to remote working and the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct the Company’s business and the business and operations of the Company’s third-party service providers who perform critical services for the Company’s business. This transition to remote working has also increased the Company’s vulnerability to risks related to the Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems and exacerbated certain related risks, including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks.The Company is continuing to monitor the spread of COVID-19, including the new recently announced variants of the disease, and related risks, including risks related to efforts to mitigate the disease’s spread. The rapid development and fluidity of the situation, however, precludes any prediction as to its ultimate impact on us. If the spread and related business restrictions continue, such impact could grow and the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The continued spread and related business restrictions could also adversely impact global economies and financial markets resulting in an economic downturn that would likely impact demand for the Company’s services. While the Company has navigated the COVID-19 pandemic thus far, the ongoing surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union, among other territories, will have a continued negative impact on the Company’s business.Any of the above factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase the Company’s costs, severely negatively impact the Company’s revenue, net income, and other results of operations, and impact the Company’s liquidity position. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted and such impacts may also have the effect of heightening many of the other material risks the Company faces. Natural disasters and unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect the Company's business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, the Company is subject to numerous risks outside of the Company's control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect the Company's business and financial performance. Historically, the Company’s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location. Any public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, coronavirus, or even a 6particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for the Company's services and the Company's ability to offer them. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to decreased ability to offer the Company's services and materially adversely affect the Company's short-term results of operations. In addition, these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants, the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically, the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events and disruption to the Company's information systems. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect the Company's reputation, business and financial condition.Risks Related to the Company’s OperationsThe Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business. The Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment in the United States was at historic lows. When unemployment levels are low, finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands is more challenging. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share. The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients. The Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. Furthermore, as the employer of record for some individuals who have been placed in client workplaces where exposure to COVID-19 is possible, the Company may be subject to risk of liability should such employees allege their workplaces failed to adequately mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19. In addition, in order to facilitate remote working arrangements, some of the Company’s temporary workers are accessing client workspaces from their personal devices through cloud-based systems, which could increase cybersecurity risks to the Company’s clients for which they may hold the Company liable. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information. In many cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business. The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of its clients. The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are impacting industries served by all the Company's lines of business. In addition, the Company’s business relies on a variety of technologies, including those that support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry 7developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The demand for the Company’s services related to Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance may decline. The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup (“JOBS”) Act signed into law in April of 2012 allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly, a number of proposals have been recently or are currently being considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Demand for the Company’s services from government and public sector clients related to the COVID-19 pandemic may decrease over time. The Company has reported increased business from services rendered to the public sector during the pandemic due to, among other developments, the volume of unemployment claims and housing assistance claims, as well as the demands faced by public school districts that must meet the technical support requirements of virtual learning models.  This business has contributed to our revenue over the past year.  It is unknown to what extent business with state, local and other public sector clients may decrease as the effects of the pandemic lessen or change over time. Demand for the Company’s services from government and public sector clients may also fall as clients adapt to the effects of the pandemic and their needs evolve.  The Company will continue to monitor the situation, but the future impact of the pandemic and its effects on the needs of the Company’s clients are impossible to fully predict, and there can be no assurance that the Company’s increased business in the public sector will be sustained.Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Additionally, the Company’s clients will frequently enter non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting the Company's future results.Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. Protiviti is a services business and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified, skilled personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations. Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel and other requirements to successfully compete.Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability. The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred, or litigation could be instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company.Legal and Regulatory RisksThe Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities. The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime 8compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions, or to various other claims, disputes, and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any future lawsuits, claims, disputes, or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry, in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.The countries in which the Company operates may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services. Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business. The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings. An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s temporary staffing operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) was signed into law in the United States. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate.9The U.S. Congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the PPACA and in 2020, the United States Supreme Court heard an appeal of a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that invalidated significant portions of the PPACA. It is unclear at this point what the scope of any such future legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding proposed replacement health care reform legislation or any modifications to such legislation to deal with these court challenges, the Company cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase. Risks Related to the Company’s Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data ProtectionThe Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption. The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees and those of the Company’s vendors. The Company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyber-attacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company’s security controls or those of its third-party vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information. Such disclosure or damage to the Company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings.Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the Company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects, uses, and retains personal information from its employees, employment candidates, and contractors, including, without limitation, full names, government-issued identification numbers, addresses, birthdates, and payroll-related information. The possession and use of personal information in conducting the Company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, protection and security, which, in many cases, apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information, such as strong safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the European Union and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer, residency, privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention, while any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Internal Controls and Accounting PoliciesFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.10Failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. Although the Company has processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner, the Company's efforts may not be sufficient. The collective impact of the tone at the top, tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management, compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues, particularly those affecting core operations, and the Company’s processes, corporate culture and general ethical climate may not be sufficient to ensure timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues.General Risk Factors
The Company’s compliance policies and controls may not prevent violations that could result in significant fines and penalties. The Company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under U.S. or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws that prohibit payments to foreign officials. Failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not only on the Company's business in that market but also on the Company's reputation generally. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, it cannot be sure that its employees, contractors or agents will not violate such policies. Any such violations could materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, changes in U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the Company’s operations.U.S. federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the Company. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law.  Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of these changes on the Company’s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the TCJA are implemented. In addition, various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the TCJA which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the Company’s results of operations"
12,RHI,ROBERT HALF INTL INC,2020-02-14,"    Risk Factors
The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:Risks Related to the Company’s Business EnvironmentAny reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business and financial condition. The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. Certain of the Company’s markets have recently experienced economic uncertainty characterized by increasing unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including ongoing trade negotiations and the ongoing negotiation of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”), have caused significant economic, market, political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company’s markets. Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company’s markets could reduce demand for the Company’s services.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results. As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants. The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants. If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company faces risks in operating internationally. The Company depends on operations in international markets for a significant portion of its business. These international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease. The value of the U.S. dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies, and 4a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the Company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets, when translated into U.S. dollars, to decline. Significant U.K. or European developments stemming from the U.K.’s decision to withdraw from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In the past several years, the European market experienced economic uncertainty, which adversely affected, and the return of which may in the future adversely affect, the Company’s operations in Europe. In particular, Brexit has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions. To the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in Europe (related to Brexit or otherwise) worsen, demand for the Company’s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. Natural disasters and unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, global political events and other serious catastrophic events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance. For example, the Company’s operations are heavily dependent on the ability of employees and consultants to travel from business to business and from location to location. Any public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, Coronavirus, or even a particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for our services and our ability to offer them. Uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to decreased ability to offer our services and materially adversely affect our short-term results of operations. In addition, these events could result in delays in placing employees and consultants, the temporary disruption in the transport of employees and consultants overseas and domestically, the inability of employees and consultants to reach or have transportation to clients directly affected by such events and disruption to our information systems. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial condition.Risks Related to the Company’s OperationsThe Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business. The Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Unemployment in the United States has been low in the past couple of years and has recently decreased further; some economists have speculated that in certain markets, the U.S. could be at or near full employment. This phenomenon has made finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands more challenging and further decreases in the employment rates could compound these difficulties. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share. The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients. The Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information. In many cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient 5insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business. The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of its clients. The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting both the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are impacting industries served by all our lines of business. In addition, the Company’s business relies on a variety of technologies, including those that support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The demand for the Company’s services related to Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance may decline. The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup (“JOBS”) Act signed into law in April of 2012 allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. Further, many analysts are expecting the U.S. Congress and President Trump to seek to repeal or modify legislation that is viewed as having over-regulated certain sectors of the U.S. economy and decreased the incentive for U.S. companies to go public and their ability to effectively compete with foreign competition. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue. Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Additionally, the Company’s clients will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results.Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel. Protiviti is a services business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified, skilled personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations. Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel and other requirements to successfully compete.Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability. The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred, or litigation could be instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company.6Legal and Regulatory RisksThe Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities. The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions, or to various other claims, disputes, and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any future lawsuits, claims, disputes, or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings. In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry, in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.The countries in which we operate may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services. Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business. The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts 7of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings. An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.The Company’s compliance policies and controls may not prevent violations that could result in significant fines and penalties. The Company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under U.S. or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws that prohibit payments to foreign officials. Failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, it cannot be sure that its employees, contractors or agents will not violate such policies. Any such violations could materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, changes in U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the Company’s operations.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s temporary staffing operations. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) was signed into law in the United States. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate.President Trump and the U.S. Congress have and likely will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA. The U.S. Congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the PPACA and in 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit invalidated significant portions of the PPACA. In 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Fifth Circuit’s decision. It is unclear at this point what the scope of any future such legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation, we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase. U.S. federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the Company. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law.  Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of these changes on the Company’s results of operations will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the TCJA are implemented. In addition, various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the TCJA which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the Company’s results of operations.Risks Related to the Company’s Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Data ProtectionThe Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption. The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees and those of the Company’s vendors. The Company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyber-attacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company’s security controls or those of its third-party vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information. Such disclosure or damage to the Company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. The potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings.8Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the Company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects, uses, and retains personal information from its employees, employment candidates, and contractors, including, without limitation, full names, government-issued identification numbers, addresses, birth dates, and payroll-related information. The possession and use of personal information in conducting the Company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, protection and security, which, in many cases, apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, imposes stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information, such as strong safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the European Union and strong enforcement authorities and mechanisms. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer, residency, privacy and protection has increased and may continue to increase the Company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention, while any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and reputation.Risks Related to the Company’s Internal Controls and Accounting PoliciesFailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.Failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner, our efforts may not be sufficient. The Company’s culture may not sufficiently encourage timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues. The collective impact of the tone at the top, tone in the middle and tone at the bottom on risk management, compliance and responsible business behavior has a huge effect on timely escalation of risk issues, particularly those affecting core operations"
5,RHI,ROBERT HALF INTL INC,2019-02-15,"    Risk Factors
The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:Any reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business and financial condition.    The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. Certain of the Company’s markets have recently experienced prolonged economic downturns characterized by high unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including the prolonged shutdown of the United States government and the ongoing negotiation of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”), have caused significant economic, market, political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company’s markets.  Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company’s markets could reduce demand for the Company’s services.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results.    As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants.  The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants.  If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities.    The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions, or to various other claims, disputes, and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any future lawsuits, claims, disputes, or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could 4cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.The Company faces risks in operating internationally.    The Company depends on operations in international markets, including Europe, for a significant portion of its business. In the past several years, the European market experienced economic uncertainty, which adversely affected, and the return of which may in the future adversely affect, the Company’s operations in Europe. In particular, Brexit has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions. To the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in Europe (related to Brexit or otherwise) worsen, demand for the Company’s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. In addition, these international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease.  The value of the U.S. dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies, and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the Company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets, when translated into U.S. dollars, to decline. The Company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under U.S. or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, it cannot be sure that its employees, contractors or agents will not violate such policies. Any such violations could materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, changes in U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the Company’s operations.Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings.    In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry, in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.The countries in which we operate may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services.  Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business.    The Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Unemployment in the United States has been low in the past couple of years and has recently decreased further; some economists have speculated that in certain markets, the U.S. could be at or near full employment. This phenomenon has made finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ demands more challenging and further increases in the employment rates could compound these difficulties. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share.    The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There 5are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients.    The Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information.  In many cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims.  The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business.    The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business.    The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company.  For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings.  An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s temporary staffing operations.    In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) was signed into law in the United States. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate. It is likely that President Trump and the U.S. Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA.  President Trump has issued multiple executive orders in support of repealing the PPACA, in whole or in part, and the U.S. Congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the PPACA.  It is unclear at this point what the scope of any future such legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation, we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Whether or 6not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase.The Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption.    The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, phishing and malware attacks, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees and those of the Company’s vendors. The Company has been subject to cyberattacks in the past, including phishing and malware incidents, and although no such attack has had a material adverse effect on its business, this may not be the case with future attacks.  In particular, the Company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyber-attacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company’s security controls or those of its third-party vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information.  Such disclosure or damage to the Company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  The potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings.

If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.Failure to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Although we have processes in place to attempt to identify and respond to risk issues in a timely manner, our efforts may not be sufficient. Further, the Company’s culture may not sufficiently encourage timely identification and escalation of significant risk issues.The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting  the development and implementation of its services and the evolving needs of its clients.    The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes  affecting both  the development and implementation of its services and the staffing needs of its clients. Technological advances such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation are impacting industries served by all our lines of business.  In addition, the Company’s business relies  on a variety of technologies, including those that  support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such 7developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The demand for the Company’s services related to Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance may decline.    The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. There are a number of proposals currently being considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. Further, many analysts are expecting the U.S. Congress and President Trump to seek to repeal or modify legislation that is viewed as having over-regulated certain sectors of the U.S. economy and decreased the incentive for U.S. companies to go public and their ability to effectively compete with foreign competition. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue.    Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.  Additionally, the Company’s clients will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results.U.S. federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the Company.  On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, limitation for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), and modifying or repealing many business deductions (including the ability to deduct executive compensation expenses in excess of $1 million in virtually all instances). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of these changes on the Company’s results of operations is uncertain and will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the TCJA are implemented. In addition, various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the TCJA which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the Company’s results of operations.Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.    Protiviti is a services business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified, skilled personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations.    Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel and other requirements to successfully compete.Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability.    The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company"

The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:Any reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business and financial condition.    The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. Certain of the Company’s markets have recently experienced prolonged economic downturns characterized by high unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including the ongoing negotiation of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (“Brexit”), have caused significant economic, market, political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company’s markets.  Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company’s markets could reduce demand for the Company’s services.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results.    As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants.  The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants.  If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities.    The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions, or to various other claims, disputes, and legal or regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits or regulatory proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur 4substantial liabilities or impact its operations in such a way that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, any future lawsuits, claims, disputes, or legal or regulatory proceedings may also consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.The Company faces risks in operating internationally.    The Company depends on operations in international markets, including Europe, for a significant portion of its business. In the past several years, the European market experienced economic uncertainty, which adversely affected, and the return of which may in the future adversely affect, the Company’s operations in Europe. In particular, Brexit has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions. To the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in Europe (related to Brexit or otherwise) worsen, demand for the Company’s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. In addition, these international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease.  The value of the U.S. dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies, and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the Company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets, when translated into U.S. dollars, to decline. The Company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under U.S. or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, it cannot be sure that its employees, contractors or agents will not violate such policies. Any such violations could materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, changes in U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the Company’s operations.Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings.    In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry, in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.The countries in which we operate may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services.  Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business.    The Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Unemployment in the United States has been low in the past couple of years and has recently decreased further; some economists have speculated that in certain markets, the U.S. could be at or near full employment. This phenomenon has made finding sufficient eligible candidates to meet employers’ 5demands more challenging and further increases in the employment rates could compound these difficulties. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share.    The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients.    The Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information.  In many cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims.  The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business.    The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business.    The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company.  For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings.  An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s temporary staffing operations.    In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) was signed into law in the United States. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate. It is likely that President Trump and the U.S. Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the PPACA.  President Trump has issued multiple executive orders in support of repealing the PPACA, 6in whole or in part, and the U.S. Congress has made several attempts to repeal or modify the PPACA.  It is unclear at this point what the scope of any future such legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation, we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase.The Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption.    The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees and those of the Company’s vendors. In particular, the Company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyber-attacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company’s security controls or those of its third-party vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information.  Such disclosure or damage to the Company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  The potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings. Changes in data privacy and protection laws and regulations in respect of control of personal information could increase the Company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations. In the ordinary course of business, the Company collects, uses, and retains personal information from its employees, employment candidates, and contractors, including, without limitation, full names, government-issued identification numbers, addresses, birth dates, and payroll-related information.  The possession and use of personal information in conducting the Company’s business subjects it to a variety of complex and evolving domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, protection and security, which, in many cases, apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the Company and its subsidiaries.  For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which becomes effective in May 2018, will impose more stringent operational requirements for entities processing personal information, such as stronger safeguards for data transfers to countries outside the European Union and stronger enforcement authorities and mechanisms.  Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the GDPR and other current and future laws and regulations relating to data transfer, residency, privacy and protection may increase the Company’s operating costs and require significant management time and attention, while any failure by the Company or its subsidiaries to comply with applicable laws could result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties that could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and reputation.Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting.    Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of its services.    The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of its services. The Company’s business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The demand for the Company’s services related to Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance may decline.    The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our 7Business Startup (“JOBS”) Act signed into law in April of 2012 allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. Further, many analysts are expecting the U.S. Congress and President Trump to seek to repeal or modify legislation that is viewed as having over-regulated certain sectors of the U.S. economy and decreased the incentive for U.S. companies to go public and their ability to effectively compete with foreign competition. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue.    Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.  Additionally, the Company’s clients will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results.U.S. federal tax regulations and interpretations could adversely affect the Company.  On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was signed into law. The TCJA resulted in a revaluation of the Company’s estimated deferred income tax net assets and a resulting one-time non-cash charge to its provision for income taxes in an amount of $34 million, or $.27 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In addition, the TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, limitation for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), and modifying or repealing many business deductions (including the ability to deduct executive compensation expenses in excess of $1 million in virtually all instances). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of these changes on the Company’s results of operations is uncertain and will likely evolve as new regulations and interpretations relating to the TCJA are implemented. In addition, various political figures have pledged their support to overturning or modifying key aspects of the TCJA which could further increase the uncertainty relating to the impact of this or any future tax legislation on the Company’s results of operations.Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.    Protiviti is a services business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified, skilled personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations.    Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel and other requirements to successfully compete.Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability.    The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company"

The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:Any reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business and financial condition.    The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. Certain of the Company’s markets have recently or are currently experiencing prolonged economic downturns characterized by high unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending. In addition, certain geopolitical events, including the United Kingdom’s vote to withdraw from the European Union (“Brexit”), have caused significant economic, market, political and regulatory uncertainty in some of the Company’s markets.  Any decline in the economic condition or employment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits. Further, continued or intensifying economic, political or regulatory uncertainty in the Company’s markets could reduce demand for the Company’s services.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results.    As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants.  The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants.  If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities.    The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, 4an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.The Company faces risks in operating internationally.    The Company depends on operations in international markets, including Europe, for a significant portion of its business. The European market has been experiencing on-going economic uncertainty, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Company’s operations in Europe. In particular, Brexit has contributed to, and may continue to contribute to, European economic, market and regulatory uncertainty and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic, market, regulatory, or political conditions. To the extent that adverse economic conditions and uncertainty in Europe (related to Brexit or otherwise) continue or worsen, demand for the Company’s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. In addition, these international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease.  The value of the U.S. dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies, and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the Company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets, when translated into U.S. dollars, to decline. The Company could also be exposed to fines and penalties under U.S. or local jurisdiction trade sanctions and controls as well as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, it cannot be sure that its employees, contractors or agents will not violate such policies. Any such violations could materially damage the Company’s reputation, brand, business and operating results. Further, changes in U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect the Company’s operations.Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings.    In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry, in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.The countries in which we operate may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services.  Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business.    The Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share.    The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the 5Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients.    The Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information.  In many cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims.  The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business.    The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business.    The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. Further, changes to existing regulation or licensing requirements could impose additional costs and other burdens or limitations on the Company’s operations. In addition, the Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company.  For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings.  An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s temporary staffing operations.    In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) was signed into law in the United States. In 2015, the Company redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in order to meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate. Numerous statements made by President Trump and members of the U.S. Congress indicate that it is likely that legislation will be passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump that repeals the PPACA, in whole or in part, and/or introduces a new form of health care reform.  It is unclear at this point what the scope of such legislation will be and when it will become effective. Because of the uncertainty surrounding this replacement health care reform legislation, we cannot predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA’s repeal or the adoption of any other health care reform legislation on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. Whether or not there is alternative health care legislation enacted in the U.S., there is likely to be significant disruption to the health care market in the coming months and years and the costs of the Company’s health care expenditures may increase.6The Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption.    The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees and those of the Company’s vendors. In particular, the Company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyber-attacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company’s security controls or those of its third-party vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information.  Such disclosure or damage to the Company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  The potential risk of security breaches and cyber-attacks may increase as the Company introduces new service offerings. It is also possible that certain jurisdictions may enact laws or regulations in respect of control of personal information that could increase the Company’s costs or otherwise adversely impact its operations.Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting.    Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of its services.    The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of its services. The Company’s business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The demand for the Company’s services related to Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance may decline.    The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup (“JOBS”) Act signed into law in April of 2012 allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. Further, many analysts are expecting the new U.S. Congress and President Trump to seek to repeal or modify legislation that is viewed as having over-regulated certain sectors of the U.S. economy and decreased the incentive for U.S. companies to go public and their ability to effectively compete with foreign competition. These or other similar modifications of the regulatory requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue.    Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.  Additionally, the Company’s clients will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, which the client is generally able to terminate on short notice and without penalty. The nature of these arrangements further exacerbates the difficulty in predicting our future results.Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.    Protiviti is a services business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified, skilled personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations.    Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many 7of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients or be able to maintain the technology, personnel and other requirements to successfully compete.Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability.    The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company"
11,RHI,ROBERT HALF INTL INC,2016-02-17,"    Risk Factors
The Company’s business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The most important of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:The global economic downturn may continue to harm the Company’s business and financial condition.    Many of the Company’s markets, particularly in Europe, are currently experiencing a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and business spending. Given the nature of the Company’s business, financial results could be significantly harmed should this downturn continue for an extended period of time or intensify. In the past, the Company’s business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demand for staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods. The impact of this downturn on the Company’s business could be further dramatized given the severe impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets.Any reduction in global economic activity may harm the Company’s business.    The demand for the Company’s services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Company’s clients. Any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specific industry may severely reduce the demand for the Company’s services and thereby significantly decrease the Company’s revenues and profits.The Company’s business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results.    As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Company’s reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants.  The Company depends on its reputation and name recognition to secure engagements and to hire qualified employees and consultants.  If the Company’s clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in or are believed to have engaged in conduct that is harmful to the Company’s clients, the Company’s ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities.    The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or on behalf of the Company’s current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters, as well as claims challenging the Company’s compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements, failure to compensate certain employees for time spent performing activities related to the interviewing process, and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtime compensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys’ fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome with respect to 4these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business.The Company faces risks in operating internationally.    The Company depends on operations in international markets, including Europe, for a significant portion of its business. The European market has been experiencing on-going economic uncertainty which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Company’s operations in Europe. To the extent that these adverse economic conditions in Europe continue or worsen, demand for the Company’s services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. In addition, these international operations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations, U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. In addition, the Company’s business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to other currencies, the Company’s reported income from these operations could decrease.  The value of the U.S. dollar has recently strengthened considerably against a number of major foreign currencies, and a continuation or extension of this strength relative to these other currencies could adversely impact the Company’s reported income from its international markets and cause its revenue in such markets, when translated into U.S. dollars, to decline. Government regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce the Company’s future earnings.    In many jurisdictions in which the Company operates, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in some countries restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which the Company’s employees may be used. In other countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of its employees. Additionally, trade unions in some countries have used the political process to target the industry, in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing temporary staffing solutions.The countries in which we operate may, among other things:•create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that the Company currently provides;•require new or additional benefits be paid to the Company’s employees;•require the Company to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or•increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes, payable by the providers of temporary workers.Any future regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for the Company to continue to provide employment services.  Additionally, as the Company expands existing service offerings, adds new service offerings, or enters new markets, it may become subject to additional restrictions and regulations which may impede its business, increase costs and impact profitability.The Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business.    The Company’s staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporary or regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or market share.    The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Company’s revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients.    The Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. The Company’s ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. While such claims have not historically had a material 5adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information.  In many cases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its clients in respect of these types of claims.  The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having sufficient insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Company’s insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business.    The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.The Company’s business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business.    The Company’s business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, the Company’s temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients’ workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, such as unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Company’s profit margins. Further, lawsuits or other proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulations or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company.  For example, the Company is currently named as a defendant in litigation challenging its compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  It is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation; however, such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings related to the Company’s compliance with government regulation or licensing requirements could consume substantial amounts of the Company’s financial and managerial resources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of any such lawsuits or other proceedings.  An unfavorable outcome with respect to such litigation or any future lawsuits or proceedings could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Health care reform could increase the costs of the Company’s temporary staffing operations.    In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”) was signed into law in the United States. The PPACA imposed new mandates on individuals and employers, requiring most individuals to have health insurance and, beginning in 2015, assessing penalties on large employers that do not offer health insurance that meets certain coverage, value, or affordability standards. Beginning 2015, the Company has redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in a way that it believes meets the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate. Providing such additional health insurance benefits and an increase in the number of employees who elect to participate in the Company’s health plans may significantly increase the Company’s health care-related costs as compared to historical periods. While the Company is attempting to recover these costs from its customers, there can be no assurance that it will be successfully able to do so, and any difficulties it encounters in recovering such costs will cause its financial results to suffer.In addition, because the regulations governing the PPACA’s employer mandate are new and subject to interpretation, it is possible that despite the Company’s efforts, the Company may incur liability in the form of penalties, fines, or damages if:•the health plans offered to temporary candidates are subsequently found not to meet minimum essential coverage, affordability or minimum value standards; •the Company’s method for determining eligibility for coverage is found inadequate; or •the Company’s clients seek indemnification for health care claims by candidates working on client assignments. The cost of any such penalties, fines, or damages could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial and operating results.6The Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption.    The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems, some of which are managed by third-party vendors. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees and those of the Company’s vendors. In particular, the Company’s employees or vendors may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyber-attacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company’s security controls or those of its third-party vendors over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information.  Such disclosure or damage to the Company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to government sanctions and liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.

Beginning 2015, the Company has redesigned its employee benefits to offer health insurance coverage to its temporary candidates in a way that it believes will meet the requirements of the PPACA’s employer mandate. Providing such additional health insurance benefits and an increase in the number of employees who elect to participate in the Company’s health plans may significantly increase the Company’s health care-related costs. While the Company will attempt to recover these costs from its customers, there can be no assurance that it will be successfully able to do so and, if it cannot recover such costs, its financial results will suffer.In addition, because the regulations governing the PPACA’s employer mandate are new and subject to interpretation, it is possible that despite the Company’s efforts, the Company may incur liability in the form of penalties, fines, or damages if:•the health plans offered to temporary candidates are subsequently found not to meet minimum essential coverage, affordability or minimum value standards; •the Company’s method for determining eligibility for coverage is found inadequate; or 6•the Company’s clients seek indemnification for health care claims by candidates working on client assignments. The cost of any such penalties, fines, or damages could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial and operating results.The Company’s computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption.    The Company’s ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems. The Company’s primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Company’s employees. In particular, the Company’s employees may have access or exposure to personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information and customer data and systems, the misuse of which could result in legal liability. Cyber-attacks, including attacks motivated by grievances against the business services industry in general or against the Company in particular, may disable or damage its systems. It is possible that the Company’s security controls over personal and other data and other practices it follows may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information.  Such disclosure or damage to the Company’s systems could harm its reputation and subject it to liability under its contracts and laws that protect personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting.    Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting. If the Company’s management is unable to certify the effectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Company’s internal controls are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able to accurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.The Company’s results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of its services.    The Company’s success depends on its ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of its services. The Company’s business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. If the Company does not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies, or evolve its business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if it does not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, the Company’s services, results of operations, and ability to develop and maintain its business could be negatively affected.The demand for the Company’s services related to Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance may decline.    The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and other regulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services. For example, the Jumpstart Our Business Startup (“JOBS”) Act signed into law in April of 2012 allows most companies going public in the U.S. to defer implementation of some of the provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley for up to five years after their initial public offering. Similarly there are a number of proposals currently being considered by the U.S. Congress to further delay or, in some cases, remove the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley for a number of public companies. These or other similar delays or modifications of the Sarbanes Oxley requirements could decrease demand for Protiviti’s services.Long-term contracts do not comprise a significant portion of the Company’s revenue.    Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Company’s staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results.Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.    Protiviti is a services business, and is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more established reputations.    Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Company’s staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the “big four” accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable period of time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, 7price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be no assurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients.Protiviti’s operations could subject it to liability.    The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company or Protiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company"
2,RHI,ROBERT HALF INTL INC,2014-02-14,"    Risk Factors
 The Companys business prospects are subject to various risks and uncertainties that impact its business. The mostimportant of these risks and uncertainties are as follows:  The global economic crisis may continue to harm theCompanys business and financial condition.    The world economy may continue in a prolonged economic downturn characterized by high unemployment, limited availability of credit and decreased consumer and businessspending. Given the nature of the Companys business, financial results could be significantly harmed should such a prolonged downturn occur. In the past, the Companys business has suffered during periods of high unemployment as demandfor staffing services tends to significantly decrease during such periods. This impact on the Companys business could be further dramatized given the unprecedented impact it has had and may continue to have on the global labor markets.  4 Any reduction in global economic activity may harm theCompanys business.    The demand for the Companys services, in particular its staffing services, is highly dependent upon the state of the economy and upon the staffing needs of the Companysclients. Any variation in the economic condition or unemployment levels of the U.S. or of any of the foreign countries in which the Company does business, or in the economic condition of any region of any of the foregoing, or in any specificindustry may severely reduce the demand for the Companys services and thereby significantly decrease the Companys revenues and profits.  The Companys business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm its results.    As a provider of temporary andpermanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Companys reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients and the services rendered by its consultants. If the Companys clientsbecome dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the Companys clients, the Companys ability to maintain or expand its client basemay be harmed.  The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several lawsuits alleging various wage and hourrelated claims that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities.    The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several actual or asserted class and representative action lawsuits brought by or onbehalf of the Companys current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour related matters. The various claims made in one or more of such lawsuits include, among other things, themisclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under applicable law, failure to comply with wage statement requirements and other related wage and hour violations. Such suits seek, as applicable, unspecified amounts for unpaid overtimecompensation, penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Companys financial and managerialresources and might result in adverse publicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome withrespect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business, financial condition or results ofoperations. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these cases could cause the Company to change its compensation plans for its employees, which could have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business. The Company faces risks in operating internationally.    The Company depends on operations in internationalmarkets, including Europe, for a significant portion of its business. The European market has been experiencing on-going economic uncertainty which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Companys operations inEurope. To the extent that these adverse economic conditions in Europe continue or worsen, demand for the Companys services may decline, which could significantly harm its business and results of operations. In addition, these internationaloperations are subject to a number of risks, including general political and economic conditions in those foreign countries, the burden of complying with various foreign laws and technical standards and unpredictable changes in foreign regulations,U.S. legal requirements governing U.S. companies operating in foreign countries, legal and cultural differences in the conduct of business, potential adverse tax consequences and difficulty in staffing and managing international operations. Inaddition, the Companys business may be affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations. In particular, the Company is subject to risk in translating its results in foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. If the value of the U.S. dollarstrengthens relative to other currencies, the Companys reported income from these operations could decrease. The Company may be unable to find sufficient candidates for its staffing business.    TheCompanys staffing services business consists of the placement of individuals seeking employment. There can be no assurance that candidates for employment will continue to seek employment through the Company. Candidates generally seek temporaryor regular positions through multiple sources, including the Company and its competitors. Any shortage of candidates could materially adversely affect the Company.   5 The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may beunable to retain clients or market share.    The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which havegreater resources than the Company, and new competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Companys revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will beable to retain clients or market share in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins. The Company may incur potential liability to employees and clients.    The Companys temporary servicesbusiness entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients workplaces. The Companys ability to control the workplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees,the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassment or failure to protect confidential personal information. While such claims have nothistorically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk ofliability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporary employees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. Whilesuch claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or thatsuch claims (whether by reason of the Company not having insurance or by reason of such claims being outside the scope of the Companys insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company. The Company is dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel couldharm its business.    The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highly dependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upontangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnel that are essential to its success.  The Companys business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure to comply with regulations could harm its business.    The Companys businessis subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complying with regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue toobtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply with government regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company.In addition, the Companys temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of theemployer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, to the extent that government regulation imposes increased costs upon the Company, suchas unemployment insurance taxes, there can be no assurance that such costs will not adversely impact the Companys profit margins.  Health care reform could increase the costs of the Companys temporary staffing operations.    In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the HealthCare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Health Care Reform Laws) were signed into law in the United States. The Health Care Reform Laws include a large number of health-related provisions, including requiringmost individuals to have health insurance and establishing new regulations on health plans. Although the Health Care Reform Laws do not mandate that employers offer health insurance, beginning in 2015 penalties will be assessed on large employerswho do not offer health insurance that meets certain affordability or benefit requirements. Providing such additional health insurance benefits to the Companys employees, or the payment of penalties if such coverage is not provided, willincrease the Companys expense. If the Company is unable to raise the rates it charges its clients to cover this expense, such increases in expense could harm the Companys financial results.   6 The Companys computer and communications hardware and software systems arevulnerable to damage and interruption.    The Companys ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer andcommunications hardware and software systems. The Companys primary computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches,catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Companys employees.  Failure to maintain adequate financial andmanagement processes and controls could lead to errors in the Companys financial reporting.    Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Companysfinancial reporting.

The Company operates in a highly competitive business and may be unable to retain clients or marketshare.    The staffing services business is highly competitive and, because it is a service business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resources than the Company, andnew competitors are entering the market all the time. In addition, long-term contracts form a negligible portion of the Companys revenue. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain clients or market share inthe future. Nor can there be any assurance that the Company will, in light of competitive pressures, be able to remain profitable or, if profitable, maintain its current profit margins.  The Companys business depends on a strong reputation and anything that harms its reputation will likely harm itsresults.    As a provider of temporary and permanent staffing solutions as well as consultant services, the Companys reputation is dependent upon the performance of the employees it places with its clients andthe services rendered by its consultants. If the Companys clients become dissatisfied with the performance of those employees or consultants or if any of those employees or consultants engage in conduct that is harmful to the Companysclients, the Companys ability to maintain or expand its client base may be harmed.  The Company may incur potential liability toemployees and clients.    The Companys temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients workplaces. The Companys ability to control theworkplace environment is limited. As the employer of record of its temporary employees, the Company incurs a risk of liability to its temporary employees for various workplace events, including claims of physical injury, discrimination, harassmentor failure to protect confidential personal information. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be no assurance that such claims in the future will not result in adverse publicity or have amaterial adverse effect   5 upon the Company. The Company also incurs a risk of liability to its clients resulting from allegations of errors, omissions or theft by its temporaryemployees, or allegations of misuse of client confidential information. The Company maintains insurance with respect to many of such claims. While such claims have not historically had a material adverse effect upon the Company, there can be noassurance that the Company will continue to be able to obtain insurance at a cost that does not have a material adverse effect upon the Company or that such claims (whether by reason of the Company not having insurance or by reason of such claimsbeing outside the scope of the Companys insurance) will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.  The Companyis dependent on its management personnel and employees and a failure to attract and retain such personnel could harm its business.    The Company is engaged in the services business. As such, its success or failure is highlydependent upon the performance of its management personnel and employees, rather than upon technology or upon tangible assets (of which the Company has few). There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to attract and retain the personnelthat are essential to its success.  The Companys business is subject to extensive government regulation and a failure tocomply with regulations could harm its business.    The Companys business is subject to regulation or licensing in many states and in certain foreign countries. While the Company has had no material difficulty complyingwith regulations in the past, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. Any inability of the Company to comply withgovernment regulation or licensing requirements could materially adversely affect the Company. In addition, the Companys temporary services business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals inclients workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer-employee relationship, or judicial or administrative proceedings related to such regulation, could materially adversely affect the Company.  The Companys computer and communications hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage and interruption.    TheCompanys ability to manage its operations successfully is critical to its success and largely depends upon the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems. The Companys primarycomputer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage by the Companys employees. Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Companys financialreporting.    Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in the Companys financial reporting. If the Companys management is unable to certify theeffectiveness of its internal controls or if its independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in the Companys internalcontrols are identified, the Company could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence. In addition, if the Company does not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, it may not be able toaccurately report its financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause its stock price to fall.  The demand for theCompanys services related to Sarbanes-Oxley or other regulatory compliance may decline.    The operations of both the staffing services business and Protiviti include services related to Sarbanes-Oxley and otherregulatory compliance. There can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for these services.  Long-term contracts donot comprise a significant portion of the Companys revenue.    Because long-term contracts are not a significant part of the Companys staffing services business, future results cannot be reliably predicted byconsidering past trends or extrapolating past results.  The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class andrepresentative action lawsuits alleging various wage and hour claims that could cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities.    The Company and certain subsidiaries are defendants in several class and representativeaction lawsuits brought by or   6 on behalf of the Companys current and former employees alleging violations of federal and state law with respect to certain wage and hour matters. TheCompany and certain subsidiaries are currently defendants in four such lawsuits, all of which are pending in California. Three of such lawsuits allege, among other things, the misclassification of certain employees as exempt employees under federaland state law and other related wage and hour violations and seek an unspecified amount for unpaid overtime compensation, statutory penalties, and other damages, as well as attorneys fees. The fourth lawsuit alleges, among other things, thattemporary employees in California were improperly denied expense reimbursement and wages for time purportedly spent preparing for, traveling to, and attending interviews, and seeks compensation for such expenses and wages, penalties and injunctiverelief, as well as attorneys fees. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits. However, these lawsuits may consume substantial amounts of the Companys financial and managerial resources and might result in adversepublicity, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the lawsuits. In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries may become subject to similar lawsuits in the same or other jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and anyfuture lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, cause the Company to incur substantial liabilities that may have a material adverse effect upon the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations.  Protiviti may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.    Protiviti is a services business, and isdependent upon its ability to attract and retain personnel. While Protiviti has retained its key personnel to date, there can be no assurance that it will continue to be able to do so.  Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business and faces competitors who are significantly larger and have more establishedreputations.    Protiviti operates in a highly competitive business. As with the Companys staffing services business, the barriers to entry are quite low. There are many competitors, some of which have greater resourcesthan Protiviti and many of which have been in operation far longer than Protiviti. In particular, Protiviti faces competition from the big four accounting firms, which have been in operation for a considerable periodof time and have established reputations and client bases. Because the principal factors upon which competition is based are reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel, there can be noassurance that Protiviti will be successful in attracting and retaining clients.  Protivitis operations couldsubject it to liability.    The business of Protiviti consists of providing business consulting and internal audit services. Liability could be incurred or litigation could be instituted against the Company orProtiviti for claims related to these activities or to prior transactions or activities. There can be no assurance that such liability or litigation will not have a material adverse impact on Protiviti or the Company"
