RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold and silver and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond our control. Gold and silver are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, the high and low price for each commodity are set forth in the following table: MetalHigh Price for 2023DateLow Price for 2023DateGold (per ounce)$2,078December 28, 2023$1,809February 27, 2023Silver (per ounce)$26.03April 14, 2023$20.09March 10, 2023Gold and silver prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations of the future rate of inflation and governmental monetary decisions regarding central bank holdings.Because we derive all of our revenues from sales of these metals, our results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In response to lower metal price and/or higher treatment and refining charge environments, we may have to revise our operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of our properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. These types of initiatives may not sufficiently offset reductions in revenues, and we may continue to incur losses associated with sustained lower metals prices.Operating costs at our mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, inflation, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. An increase in the cost, or decrease in the availability, of input commodities, labor, or equipment, due to factors beyond the Company’s control may affect the timely conduct and cost of our operations and development projects. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.Volatility in metals prices may also impact the price of our outstanding securities.Although our results of operations and cash flow will reflect fluctuations in the prices of the metals we produce, short term volatility in the prices of these metals due to speculation in the market may result in significant changes in the price of our securities, which may not be reflective of our operating performance or financial results. For example, the price of silver increased 5% between April 5, 2023 and April 14, 2023, and then decreased by 5% on April 19, 2023. This swing in the price of silver was seemingly attributable to a coordinated effort by market participants to drive up the price of silver and did not reflect changes in the underlying fundamentals that typically drive changes in the price of silver, including supply and demand. The price of our common stock increased by 4% and decreased by 5% during the same periods. The trading volume for shares of our common stock also increased significantly during this period. This volatility in the price of our common stock did not, in our view, reflect any significant change in our business or results of operations during the same period. The estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources may not be realized in actual production. Our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates. The mineral reserve and mineral resource figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom we contract. Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require us to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. While the Company believes that its mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are developed using well-established practices and with appropriate controls, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of these estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead may render mineral reserves and mineral resources containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, 10and we may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties or write down assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our mines or projects that are different from those predicted, we may adjust our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and alter our mining plans. No assurances can be given that all mineral reserves will be mined, as mineralized material that may qualify as reserves under applicable standards by virtue of having positive economics may not generate attractive enough returns to be included in our mine plans, due to factors such as the impact of the gold stream at Palmarejo. As a result, we may elect not to mine portions of the mineralized material reported as reserves. In addition, no assurances can be given that any mineral resource estimate will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves or that inferred resources will be upgraded to measured or indicated resources. Updates to our mining plans or new or updated technical or geological information may also impact anticipated metal recovery rates. Any of these adjustments may adversely affect actual operating performance, production, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or doré as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We rely on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase the gold and silver doré and gold and silver concentrate produced by our mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economic terms is critical to our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. We have existing agreements with refiners and smelters, some of whom operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States. We believe we currently have contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact our operations or our ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, shipping delays, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create (or the necessity to terminate) a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave us with limited, uneconomic or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters may also impact refiners, smelters or other third parties with whom we have contractual arrangements or have an indirect effect on our ability to obtain refining, smelting or other third-party services. Any delay or loss of access to refiners or smelters may significantly impact our ability to sell doré and concentrate products and generate revenues. A default by a refiner or smelter on its contractual obligations to us or an insolvency event or bankruptcy filing by a refiner or smelter may result in the loss of all or part of our doré or concentrate in the possession of the refiner or smelter, and such a loss likely would not be insured by our insurance policies. We cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available, that they would offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise, or that we would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, geotechnical failures, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or machine failure. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.We maintain insurance policies that protect against property loss and business interruption in amounts that we believe are reasonable taking into account the nature of, and risks related to, our business and operations as well as the cost of policy premiums. Such insurance is, however, subject to certain exclusions, and potential claims could exceed policy limits. There is no guarantee that we will receive insurance proceeds with respect to a particular event or loss. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that we incur for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSOur future growth will depend upon our ability to expand existing mines and develop and start-up new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies or properties. Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, our ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon our success in further developing and expanding existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development and start-up of exploration projects or new mining properties, such 11as the expected acquisition of mining concessions from a subsidiary of Fresnillo plc that are located adjacent to the existing Palmarejo site.While initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. Palmarejo completed open pit mining several years ago and evolved to be an underground-only operation, developing new underground mining operations. At Rochester, we completed construction of and are in the process of commissioning and ramping up POA 11, which is a significant additional expansion that includes a three-stage crushing facility, a new leach pad, and a new Merrill-Crowe processing facility and related infrastructure to support the extension of Rochester’s mine life. Of note, we continue to use the existing refinery at Rochester to produce doré from both the old and the new Merrill-Crowe processing facility. At Kensington, we amended our operating permit to allow for an additional 10 years of mine life by providing for expanded tailings and waste rock storage, increased mill throughput, enhanced infrastructure and other benefits (“POA 1”). We are in the midst of a multi-year exploration and underground mine development program to extend the mine life. Our ability to timely complete these and future mine expansion and mine life extension projects is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, availability of funding on acceptable terms, timing of receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities, obtaining materials and equipment and construction, engineering and other services at favorable prices and terms, and disputes with third-party providers of materials, equipment or services. Construction services performed by contractors create a risk of delays or additional costs resulting from, among other factors: inability to negotiate contracts with favorable pricing and terms; delays in performance of the services; failure of a contractor to comply with applicable laws and regulations; termination of a contract by a contractor before completion of the services; failure by a contractor to obtain necessary equipment or materials; mismanagement by a contractor of its workforce; and insolvency or other financial difficulty encountered by a contractor which results in a delay in services or termination of a contract with the contractor. Expected benefits from the Rochester expansion are based on estimates of a variety of key factors, including mineral reserves and resources, grade, recovery rates, the ability of processing infrastructure such as the refinery to meet higher throughput rates, and operating costs among others. However, achieving results in line with those estimates is subject to risks and uncertainties such as variability in grade, recovery rates and cost inputs and any inability of infrastructure to accommodate higher throughput. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully expand or extend the lives of existing mining operations, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefits, such as expected availability, throughput, metal recovery rates, concentrate quality, unit costs, operating margin and/or cash flows, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.In addition, we have acquired mining properties such as the Silvertip exploration property. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and start-up new mining properties, restart mining and processing activities at the Silvertip exploration property or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.We regularly evaluate and engage in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that we contemplate or pursue would involve risks and uncertainties and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.We may be unable to successfully integrate, may not realize the expected benefits of recent or future acquisitions or may face risks associated with divestitures.We regularly explore opportunities to selectively acquire other businesses or assets or to divest ourselves of all or part of certain assets in support of our growth plans and strategic objectives. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of past acquisitions or any future acquisition, will be realized on the originally anticipated timeline or at all. The success and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend upon our ability to effectively manage the integration, performance and operations of entities or properties we acquire. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen challenges and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources, which may divert focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and/or from operational matters during this process. As an example, the ramp up of the Silvertip exploration property, acquired in late 2017, was slower and less profitable than originally anticipated, due primarily to more significant mill availability and maintenance challenges than were anticipated at the time Silvertip was acquired, as well as deteriorating zinc and lead market conditions. In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in macroeconomic conditions, including commodity prices, treatment and refining charges or stock prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;•additional debt incurred or issued to fund some or all of acquisition consideration (as was the case with Silvertip and Wharf), resulting in increased interest expense and other borrowing costs;12•issuance of equity securities as acquisition consideration (which occurred in the Lincoln Hill and Silvertip project acquisitions), resulting in dilution of our existing stockholders;•a material ore body may prove to be below our expectations;•processing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment, such as the original mill at Silvertip;•difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies and supporting expanded operations, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization;•difficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous peoples; and•the acquired business or assets may have significant liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that we failed to discover or have underestimated.We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our common stock or assure that we will be able to obtain necessary acquisition or development financing on acceptable terms or at all. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional liabilities, indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any future mine development, may negatively affect our results of operations.The Company recently sold its interests in the Crown, Sterling and La Preciosa projects. In connection with these dispositions, the Company has provided representations, warranties and indemnities customary for transactions of these types. There may be a risk that the Company may incur liability in the future associated with assets it no longer owns or in which it has a reduced interest.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business. Our ability to sustain or increase current production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish mineral reserves, to extract metals from ore and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Our plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations or exploration properties, including the Rochester expansion project now undergoing commissioning and ramp-up, and the POA 1 planned mine life extension at Kensington, and future plans to develop the Silvertip exploration project. These projects can take up to several months or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks described in this Item, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.Mineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity or quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations, including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply, unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects such as Silvertip may have little or no relevant operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques and feasibility studies. Estimates of operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.13The Company may be affected by global supply chain disruptions.The Company may face supply chain disruptions as a result of matters outside of the Company’s control or ability to mitigate, such as natural disasters, transportation disruptions, economic instability, geopolitical unrest, civil or international hostilities and global pandemics, among others. Recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict have resulted in losses of life, displacement of people, and political and economic disruptions on a global scale. There may be unforeseen impacts from these events globally on commodity prices, liquidity and credit or supply chains, and the Company continues to monitor them closely.We may be required to write down certain long-lived assets, due to metal prices, operational challenges or other factors. Such write- downs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We review our long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, we review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as our mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. We conduct a review of the financial performance of our mines in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for each reporting period and determine whether any triggering events are indicated.If there are significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if we fail to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, we may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of our assets. Any such actions would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may record other types of charges in the future if we sell a property or asset for a price less than its carrying value or have to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties or other assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Coeur is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.A significant portion of our revenues is generated by operations outside the United States, particularly Mexico. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond our control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to our business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which we, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, aggressive or punitive tax audits, policy-driven interference with or moratoriums on processing of permit applications or granting water or mineral concessions, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, changes to mining and related laws impacting current and future operations, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. As an example, as disclosed in Note 18 -- Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently engaged in efforts to recover amounts unduly paid to the Mexican government that are owed to Coeur associated with Coeur Mexicana’s prior royalty agreement, including through international arbitration. While the Company believes that it remains legally entitled to be refunded the full amount of the unduly paid VAT receivable and intends to rigorously continue its recovery efforts, based on the continued failure to recover the receivable and unfavorable Mexican court decisions, the Company determined to write down the carrying value of the receivable of $26.0 million at September 2021. In addition, recent amendments to mining, water and environmental laws in Mexico, and government actions intended to slow or halt the normal processing of permits and granting of water or mineral concessions, could impose additional restrictions on our ability to obtain and maintain mining and water rights and operate in Mexico, among other potentially adverse provisions. The right to import and export gold and silver may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, our rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require us to curtail or terminate operations at our mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, address aggressive or punitive tax audit assessments including through litigation, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.14Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks.Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions, as well as epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters, can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of our foreign operations, including drug cartel-related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect our ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of extortion and theft, greater risks to our personnel, and greater risks to the supply of goods and services to our operations and our property. These conditions, including security concerns in certain communities surrounding the Palmarejo complex impacting third-party deliveries of supplies to Palmarejo, could adversely impact our operations and lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are not uncommon in areas of Mexico where our operations or projects are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. We cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect our business.We sell silver doré, gold doré, gold concentrate, and silver concentrate in U.S. dollars, but we conduct operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect our results of operations.Our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.  Our ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding our operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of our properties, and other stakeholders in our operating locations. We believe our operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, we seek to maintain our partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. There is an increasing level of public concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on indigenous communities. Evolving expectations related to human rights, indigenous interests and environmental protection may result in opposition to the Company’s current or future activities. Notwithstanding our ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with our activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against us or our operations. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities.  No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Waste rock in the form of tailings generated as a by-product of processed ore is produced at the Kensington and Palmarejo Mines. We place tailings into engineered containments, underground as structural backfill, and as thickened tailing, into a former open pit. In response to several recent tailings dam failures unrelated to our operations that have involved loss of life and resulted in severe property and environmental ecosystem damage, we completed a comprehensive review of our tailings dams and operational practices to characterize our risk profile. We concluded that our tailings dams represent a low exposure risk profile for several reasons, including that our tailings dams were constructed using construction methods recognized in the industry as the most stable tailings dam design using high strength and chemically stable rock in construction. Our dams are continuously monitored and inspected by internal resources as well as third-party industry qualified experts.  The significant dam failure events at third-party locations that have occurred in recent years may lead to regulatory governance changes stemming from updated laws, regulation or guidance, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs if we need to make changes to existing facilities. The failure of a tailings dam or tailings storage facility at one of our mine sites could result in severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, lawsuits filed by parties who suffer injuries or property damage from such events, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineral reserves and resources and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock.15Our estimates of future production, costs, expenditures and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.We have in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of our future production, costs, expenditures and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on these estimates and projections. Estimates and projections are made by our management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralization, recovery rates, our costs of production, the market prices of gold and silver, our ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and doré and related treatment and refining charges, the sufficiency of our infrastructure, the performance of our personnel and equipment, our ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and our compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. We sometimes state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any production, cost, expenditure or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made, and undue reliance should not be placed on them.Our use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market fair value adjustments, potential cash collateral calls and exposure to counterparty credit risk.We have in the past, and may in the future, enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold and silver, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments. We entered into price risk management contracts on 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 gold and silver sales. We determined to implement these contracts to provide for a minimum level of revenue from the sales of the covered gold and silver ounces in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to fund all or a portion of the costs of several significant projects at existing operations such as the Rochester expansion as well as provide greater certainty in our planning and budgeting process. As of December 31, 2023, contracts with respect to 94,950 ounces of gold and 3.1 million ounces of silver were outstanding. See Note 14 — Derivative Financial Instruments & Hedging Activities in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The use of derivative instruments can expose us to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may require us to post cash or other collateral or have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. Our exposure may be particularly acute for our derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges because those contracts are cash net settled on a monthly basis. The ceiling on the gold and silver ounces covered by the price risk management contracts described above, representing the highest price we could realize for those ounces under outstanding contracts, averages $2,076 and $25.16 per ounce, respectively, for the first half of 2024 production. The price ceiling may be lower than actual spot gold prices at the time of sale under those contracts. On February 20, 2024, the closing price of gold and silver was $2,029 and $23.06 per ounce, respectively. We are exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, we could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.We are dependent upon information technology and operational technology, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and other risks associated with implementation and integration. The information technology and operational technology used in our business and operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology, operational technology and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems, equipment and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. We may also incur large expenditures to recover data, to repair or replace networks or information or to protect against similar future events.16We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Although the Company has not experienced any material loss to date relating to cybersecurity, there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur such loss in the future. We carry cybersecurity insurance; however, it may not be sufficient to cover losses arising from cybersecurity incidents that may occur.There has been heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and cybersecurity in the U.S and elsewhere. We may be required to comply with a fast-evolving set of legal requirements in this area, including substantive data privacy and cybersecurity standards. This regulatory environment may present material obligations and risks to our business, including significantly expanded compliance burdens, costs and enforcement risks.We may be expected to continue enhancing our ESG practices to meet evolving and inconsistent standards. ESG factors, including climate-related initiatives such as GHG emissions targets and climate risk management, are increasingly becoming a metric for institutional investors to review and assess the performance of the Company and a significant factor in their investment decisions. We believe we have established ourselves as a leader among peers in ESG and continued to advance our ESG initiatives as highlighted in our 2022 ESG Report, which included specific, objective goals to continue to improve our industry-leading safety record, continue reducing the net intensity of our GHG emissions across the Company, advance our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, strengthen community relations and protect critical habitat. However, there are no assurances that our efforts will be sufficient or meet the standards set by ESG analysts or institutional or other investors.Our operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected by an outbreak of infectious disease or  pandemic.An outbreak of infectious disease, pandemic or a similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response thereto, could adversely impact our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and “shelter-in-place” and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend operations at one or more of our mines, which could reduce production, limit exploration activities and development projects and impact liquidity and financial results. While we have implemented several initiatives to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities to date, some of which have and may result in additional costs to us, there can be no assurance that the Company will remain unaffected by potential future health crises.Illnesses or government restrictions, including potential closure of national borders, related to COVID-19 or a similar public health threat may disrupt the supply of raw goods, equipment, supplies and services upon which our operations rely. Third parties with whom we conduct business, including the refiners and smelters that process and, in some cases, purchase the doré and concentrate produced by our mines, are also subject to these risks and may be required to reduce or suspend operations, which could impact our ability to conduct our operations, advance exploration, development and expansion projects, sell our products and generate revenues.To the extent the COVID-19 or any other pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section, such as those relating to our operations and indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 or similar pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the full impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor such situations closely.Our business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees. We may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. We cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose us to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.17Continuation of our mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies. Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, our properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. For example, in January 2024, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation issued a ruling that invalidated certain non-material surface water rights previously utilized at Palmarejo. Although each of our operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to enforcement of water rights, claims and uses, or potential pressure from other users of water, government agencies and officials, and/or non-governmental organizations to limit the amount of water made available to or used for mining activities, regardless of legally valid water rights. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts outside of our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, ongoing litigation to enforce existing water rights, ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights and/or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water could result in our inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining operations or could prevent us from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, adversely affecting our existing operations or our expansion or development plans. We may not be able to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets.We have accrued deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions from past operating losses, however, we may not be able to utilize part or all of these assets in the future. We recognize the expected future tax benefit from these assets only if it is considered more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be utilized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, including application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction, assumptions about future metals prices, the macroeconomic environment and results of our operations. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future benefits represented by our deferred tax assets and annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting cash tax liabilities in a future period. RISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING Our future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $545.3 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond our control, including the market prices of gold and silver, among other factors described in this Item. Although we have been successful in repaying or refinancing debt historically, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments.If and to the extent liquidity resources are insufficient to support short- and long-term expenditures, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, incur additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot predict whether we would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or debt securities or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.The terms of our debt impose restrictions on our operations.The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:18•limit our ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;•require us to meet certain financial covenants including a senior secured leverage ratio, a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;•require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, which reduces the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit our ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and•place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our inability to meet any of these covenants may also result in a lender requiring us to agree to additional restrictive covenants which may, among other things, limit our ability to fund our existing operations or incur additional indebtedness. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of our outstanding debt instruments if any of our debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to us or our debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold or silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding debt securities, our existing debt, and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.RISKS RELATED TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONSWe are subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines under the British Columbia Mines Act and Relevant Sections of the Mexican Official Regulations, and related costs and delays associated with compliance may negatively affect our business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines are regularly inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). These inspections may lead to written citations or violation notices, which are reported in Exhibit 95.1 to this Report. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general, focusing on miner health and critical safety hazards. Similar inspections are conducted in British Columbia, Canada, at the Silvertip exploration property and in Mexico at the Palmarejo complex by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Mexican Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Secretary of Labor and Social Safety), respectively.19Recent amendments to mining, water and environmental laws in Mexico, and the subsequent corresponding regulations thereto, could impose additional restrictions on our ability to obtain and maintain mining and water rights and operate in Mexico, among other potentially adverse provisions. Legal actions challenging the validity and implementation of these recent amendments have been filed by various groups and the proceedings remain ongoing.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures, including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation and environmental justice provisions are evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. We may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require us to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that we have made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that we currently or previously owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. We cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining waste from our U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, we would be required to make significant expenditures to manage the waste and to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. Under the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (“MEBA”), incidental elemental mercury generated at our Rochester mine as part of the processing of ore may not be exported outside of the United States and is required to be stored in a facility capable for long-term mercury management designated by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”). The DOE is undergoing processes to designate such a facility and to establish storage and handling fees, which is not yet final. The outcome could result in material cost being incurred to ship and store Coeur Rochester's mercury. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal/indigenous governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on our tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota, in British Columbia (Canada) under the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia, the British Columbia Environmental Management Act and the Canadian Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations, and in Mexico under the General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection of the Environment (the ""GLEBPE"") and the regulations under the GLEBPE related to environmental protection in impact assessment matters.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in the U.S. and are regulated under the Environmental Management Act in British Columbia (Canada) and the GLEBPE and the regulations under GLEBPE related to prevention and control of the pollution of the atmosphere in Mexico. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased 20environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impact of such laws or regulations.In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under relevant mining law, which could have the effect of restricting our current or future planned activities involving our unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.We are required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. Our ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations may be materially affected by third-party activists.In the normal course of our business, we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects, such as the permits recently obtained for the Rochester expansion, POA 1 at Kensington and at Palmarejo to allow the deposit of future tailings into the legacy open pit rather than expand the current tailings impoundment facility. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority and government and third-party sentiment towards the mining industry generally. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations, or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed our expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could impede or delay the development or operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect our revenues and future growth. For example, we experienced prolonged delays by the Mexican federal environmental authority, SEMARNAT, in approving the permit described above to deposit future tailings into the legacy open pit at Palmarejo, and we continue to experience prolonged delays in the routine renewal of various operating permits at Palmarejo. As has been publicized in media coverage, we understand that other mining projects in Mexico are also experiencing extended permitting delays or, in certain circumstances, denials of permits, due to anti-mining policies of the current Mexican Administration. Any delay in obtaining a permit may require us to revise mine plans or curtail expected production, which could materially adversely affect results of operations and cash flow. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects our operations. For example, we recently received a notice of revocation of our permit to operate back-up generators at Palmarejo. We are appealing the revocation and have been granted the right to continue operating the back-up generators during the course of the appeal. We are also applying for a new permit in case our appeal is not successful, but there can be no assurance that the revocation of the prior permit will not have an adverse impact on Palmarejo’s operating and financial results.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third-party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause us to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct our operations will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate.Our business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.We operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws and we provide training and education on these topics to our employees; however, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts or violations of laws committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration (including the current NAFTA arbitration matter involving recovery of amounts unduly paid as VAT in Mexico) or proceedings with other parties. If decided 21adversely to us, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. We are currently engaged in litigation with a third party regarding the terms of a royalty impacting a portion of the Kensington mine property. While we believe our claims and counter-claims in this matter are valid, litigation matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality and the likely outcome of this matter will be consistent with the ultimate resolution of the matter. Responding to disputes, even those that are without merit or ultimately decided in our favor, may require us to incur significant expense, devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Disputes regarding our mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of our mining projects could adversely impact operations. The validity of exploration or mining claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of our property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. We have used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standards, to investigate our title or claims to our various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration or mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration or mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice, we do not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles may be defective, particularly titles to undeveloped properties. Defective title to any of our exploration or mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting our business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims, concessions or rights comprising our projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in us losing all or a portion of our right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While we have agreements or are in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of our projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation or legal challenges.The Company’s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in tax laws, mix of earnings and other factors.We are subject to tax laws in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. U.S. President Biden’s administration (the “Administration”) has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform.The Administration has previously proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income, and other various tax law changes. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.Additionally, the jurisdictions in which we operate have and may in the future continue to encounter financial difficulties resulting from one or both of lower tax revenue and new and increased costs related to continuing to manage or remedy the impacts of COVID-19 or other pandemics or public health threats.  National, state or local governments may seek to raise existing taxes or introduce new taxes  which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Currently, the Company incurs losses in certain countries where it does not receive a financial statement benefit, and the Company operates in countries which have different statutory rates. Consequently, changes in the mix and source of earnings between countries could have a material impact on the Company’s overall effective tax rate.In addition, new tax legislation in certain jurisdictions where we operate could negatively affect us. For example, in Nevada, where the Rochester mine and Lincoln Hill project are located, in response to a significant loss of tourism and gaming revenue during 2020, in June 2021, the Governor signed into law a new excise tax on gross proceeds derived from mining gold and silver. In 2023, an inter-agency working group led by the U.S. Interior Department recommended implementing a fee on certain domestic hardrock mineral production equivalent to 4-8% of net proceeds. In addition, there have been recent proposals by elected officials in Mexico for even more significant increases in mining taxes, although it is unclear whether those proposals will result in legislation. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions where we 22operate will be passed and if passed, the impact of those changes on the Company. Any additional taxes imposed on us could adversely affect our financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of our existing stockholders’ equity ownership. In 2023, the Company completed two “at the market” offerings with an aggregate value of $150.0 million of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and sold a total of 54,561,436 shares of common stock at an average price of $2.75 per share. The Company also agreed to exchange an aggregate $76.0 million principal amount of its 5.125% Senior Notes (the “Senior Notes”) for an aggregate 25.2 million shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, pursuant to 12 privately-negotiated agreements in 2023, with such issuance of common stock made pursuant to the exemption from the registration requirements afforded by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In 2023, the Company also entered into subscription agreements with certain Canadian accredited investors for a private placement offering of an aggregate 5,276,154 share of common stock, par value $0.01 per shares, to be issued as “flow-through shares,” as defined in subsection 66(15) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) and granted an over-allotment option of up to 3,000,000 additional flow through shares, which was exercised in full. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends. We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors.23"
2,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2023-02-22,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold and silver and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond our control. Gold and silver are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, the high and low price for each commodity are set forth in the following table: MetalHigh Price for 2022DateLow Price for 2022DateGold (per ounce)$2,039March 8, 2022$1,618September 28, 2022Silver (per ounce)$26.18March 9, 2022$17.77September 1, 2022Gold and silver prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations of the future rate of inflation and governmental monetary decisions regarding central bank holdings.Because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of these metals, our results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In response to lower metal price and/or higher treatment and refining charge environments, we may have to revise our operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of our properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. These types of initiatives may not sufficiently offset reductions in revenues, and we may continue to incur losses associated with sustained lower metals prices.Operating costs at our mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, inflation (as was the case during 2022), currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. An increase in the cost, or decrease in the availability, of input commodities, labor, or equipment, due to factors beyond the Company’s control such as a pandemic or a similar public health threat, may affect the timely conduct and cost of our operations and development projects. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.Volatility in metals prices may also impact the price of our outstanding securities.Although our results of operations and cash flow will reflect fluctuations in the prices of the metals we produce, short term volatility in the prices of these metals due to speculation in the market may result in significant changes in the price of our securities, which may not be reflective of our operating performance or financial results. For example, the price of silver increased 14% between September 28, 2022 and October 4, 2022, and then decreased by 13% on October 19, 2022. This swing in the price of silver was seemingly attributable to a coordinated effort by market participants to drive up the price of silver and did not reflect changes in the underlying fundamentals that typically drive changes in the price of silver, including supply and demand. The price of our common stock increased by 13% and decreased by 6% during the same periods. The trading volume for shares of our common stock also increased significantly during this period. This volatility in the price of our common stock did not, in our view, reflect any significant change in our business or results of operations during the same period. The estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources may not be realized in actual production. Our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates. The mineral reserve and mineral resource figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom we contract. Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require us to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. While the Company believes that its mineral reserve and resource estimates are developed using well-established practices and with appropriate controls, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of these estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead 10may render mineral reserves and mineral resources containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties or write down assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our mines or projects that are different from those predicted, we may adjust our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and alter our mining plans. No assurances can be given that any mineral resource estimate will ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves or that inferred resources will be upgraded to measured or indicated resources. Updates to our mining plans or new or updated technical or geological information may also impact anticipated metal recovery rates. Any of these adjustments may adversely affect actual operating performance, production, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or doré as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We rely on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver doré and gold and silver concentrate produced by our mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economic terms is critical to our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. We have existing agreements with refiners and smelters, some of whom operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States. We believe we currently have contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact our operations or our ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, shipping delays, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create (or the necessity to terminate) a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave us with limited, uneconomic or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters may also impact refiners, smelters or other third parties with whom we have contractual arrangements or have an indirect effect on our ability to obtain refining, smelting or other third-party services. Any delay or loss of access to refiners or smelters may significantly impact our ability to sell doré and concentrate products and generate revenues. A default by a refiner or smelter on its contractual obligations to us or an insolvency event or bankruptcy filing by a refiner or smelter may result in the loss of all or part of our doré or concentrate in the possession of the refiner or smelter, and such a loss likely would not be insured by our insurance policies. We cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or machine failure. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.We maintain insurance policies that protect against property loss and business interruption in amounts that we believe are reasonable taking into account the nature of, and risks related to, our business and operations as well as the cost of policy premiums. Such insurance is, however, subject to certain exclusions and potential claims could exceed policy limits. There is no guarantee that we will receive insurance proceeds with respect to a particular event or loss. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that we incur for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSOur future growth will depend upon our ability to expand existing mines and develop and start-up new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies or properties. Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, our ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon our success in further developing and expanding existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development and start-up of exploration projects or new mining properties, such as the Silvertip exploration property and the Lincoln Hill project and related assets.While initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. Palmarejo completed open pit mining several years ago and evolved to be an underground-only operation, developing new underground mining operations. At 11Rochester, a crushing circuit using high pressure grinding roll (“HPGR”) technology was commissioned in 2019, and, in 2020, we obtained permitting for, and began construction of POA 11, which is a significant additional expansion expected to be completed in mid-2023, including the construction of a new leach pad, a crushing facility equipped with two HPGR units and a prescreen, processing facilities and related infrastructure to support the extension of Rochester’s mine life. At Kensington, we completed development and commenced commercial production from a new deposit in 2018 and amended our operating permit to allow for an additional 10 years of mine life by providing for expanded tailings and waste rock storage, increased mill throughput, enhanced infrastructure and other benefits (“POA 1”). Our ability to timely complete these and future mine expansion and mine life extension projects is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, availability of funding on acceptable terms, timing of receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities, obtaining materials and equipment and construction, engineering and other services at favorable prices and terms, and disputes with third-party providers of materials, equipment or services. The construction services related to POA 11 are being performed by contractors, which creates a risk of delays or additional costs to the project resulting from, among other factors:  inability to negotiate contracts with favorable pricing and terms; delays in performance of the services; failure of a contractor to comply with applicable laws and regulations; termination of a contract by a contractor before completion of the services; failure by a contractor to obtain necessary equipment or materials; mismanagement by a contractor of its workforce; and insolvency or other financial difficulty encountered by a contractor which results in a delay in services or termination of a contract with the contractor. Expected project benefits are based on estimates of a variety of key factors, including mineral reserves and resources, grade, recovery rates, and operating costs among others.  However, achieving results in line with those estimates is subject to risks and uncertainties such as variability in grade, recovery rates and cost inputs. For example, in 2022, Rochester experienced lower than expected silver recovery rates from its HPGR-crushed ore, which negatively impacted production, costs and cash flow. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully expand or extend the lives of existing mining operations, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefits, such as expected availability, throughput, metal recovery rates, concentrate quality, unit costs, operating margin and/or cash flows, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.In addition, we acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Lincoln Hill project and related assets and the Silvertip exploration property. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and start-up new mining properties, restart mining and processing activities at the Silvertip exploration property or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.We regularly evaluate and engage in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that we contemplate or pursue would involve risks and uncertainties and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.We may be unable to successfully integrate, may not realize the expected benefits of recent or future acquisitions or may face risks associated with divestitures.We regularly explore opportunities to selectively acquire other businesses or assets or to divest ourselves of all or part of certain assets in support of our growth plans and strategic objectives. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of past acquisitions (including the Silvertip exploration property and Lincoln Hill project) or any future acquisition, will be realized on the originally anticipated timeline or at all. The success and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend upon our ability to effectively manage the integration, performance and operations of entities or properties we acquire. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen challenges and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources, which may divert focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and/or from operational matters during this process. As an example, the ramp up of the Silvertip exploration property, acquired in late 2017, was slower and less profitable than originally anticipated, due primarily to more significant mill availability and maintenance challenges than were anticipated at the time Silvertip was acquired, as well as deteriorating zinc and lead market conditions. In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in macroeconomic conditions, including commodity prices, treatment and refining charges or stock prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;•additional debt incurred or issued to fund some or all of acquisition consideration (as was the case with Silvertip and Wharf), resulting in increased interest expense and other borrowing costs;•issuance of equity securities as acquisition consideration (which occurred in the Lincoln Hill and Silvertip project acquisitions), resulting in dilution of our existing stockholders;•a material ore body may prove to be below our expectations;12•processing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment, such as the mill at Silvertip;•difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies and supporting expanded operations, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization;•difficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous peoples; and•the acquired business or assets may have significant liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that we failed to discover or have underestimated.We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our common stock or assure that we will be able to obtain necessary acquisition or development financing on acceptable terms or at all. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional liabilities, indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any future mine development, may negatively affect our results of operations.The Company recently sold its interests in the Crown, Sterling and La Preciosa projects. In connection with these dispositions, the Company has provided representations and warranties and indemnities customary for transactions of these types. There may be a risk that the Company may incur liability in the future associated with assets it no longer owns or in which it has a reduced interest.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business. Our ability to sustain or increase current production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish mineral reserves, to extract metals from ore and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Our plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations or exploration properties, including the POA 11 expansion project at Rochester and the POA 1 planned mine life extension at Kensington, and future plans to develop the Silvertip and Lincoln Hill projects. These projects can take up to several months or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks described in this Item, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.Mineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects, such as the Silvertip or Lincoln Hill projects may have little or no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of resources and reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.The Company may be affected by global supply chain disruptions.The Company may face supply chain disruptions as a result of macroeconomic matters outside of the Company’s control or ability to mitigate, such as natural disasters, transportation disruptions, economic instability, and global pandemics, among others. Most recently, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in losses of life, displacement of people, and 13political and economic disruptions on a global scale. There may be unforeseen impacts from these events globally on commodity prices, liquidity and credit or supply chains, and the Company continues to monitor them closely.We may be required to write down certain long-lived assets, due to metal prices, operational challenges or other factors. Such write- downs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We review our long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, we review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as our mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. We conduct a review of the financial performance of our mines in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for each reported period and determine whether any triggering events are indicated.If there are significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if we fail to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, we may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of our assets. Any such actions would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may record other types of charges in the future if we sell a property or asset for a price less than its carrying value or have to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties or other assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Coeur is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.A significant portion of our revenues is generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond our control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to our business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which we, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. As an example, as disclosed in Note 19 -- Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently engaged in efforts to recover VAT paid to the Mexican government that is owed to Coeur associated with Coeur Mexicana’s prior royalty agreement, including through international arbitration. While the Company believes that it remains legally entitled to be refunded the full amount of the VAT receivable and intends to rigorously continue its VAT recovery efforts, based on the continued failure to recover the VAT receivable and unfavorable Mexican court decisions, the Company determined to write down the carrying value of the VAT receivable of $26.0 million at September 2021. The right to import and export gold and silver may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, our rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require us to curtail or terminate operations at our mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks.Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions, as well as epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters, can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of our foreign operations, including drug cartel-related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect our ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of extortion and theft and greater risks to our personnel, supply of goods and services to our operations and our property. These conditions, including security concerns in certain communities surrounding the Palmarejo complex in 2022 impacting third party deliveries of supplies to Palmarejo, could adversely impact our operations and lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are not uncommon in areas in Mexico where our operations or projects are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally entitled access to 14mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. We cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect our business.We sell silver and gold doré, gold concentrate, and silver concentrate in U.S. dollars, but we conduct operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect our results of operations.Our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.  Our ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding our operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of our properties, and other stakeholders in our operating locations. We believe our operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, we seek to maintain our partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. There is an increasing level of public concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on indigenous communities. Evolving expectations related to human rights, indigenous interests and environmental protection may result in opposition to the Company’s current or future activities. Notwithstanding our ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with our activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against us or our operations. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities.  No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Waste rock in the form of tailings generated as a by-product of processed ore is produced at the Kensington and Palmarejo Mines. We place tailings into engineered containments, underground as structural backfill, and as a dry stack material. In response to several recent tailings dam failures unrelated to our operations that have involved loss of life and resulted in severe property and environmental ecosystem damage, we completed a comprehensive review of our tailings dams and operational practices to characterize our risk profile. We concluded that our tailings dams represent a low exposure risk profile for several reasons, including that our tailings dams were constructed using construction methods recognized in the industry as the most stable tailings dam design using high strength and chemically stable rock in construction. Our dams are continuously monitored and inspected by internal resources as well as third-party industry qualified experts.  The significant dam failure events at third party locations that have occurred in recent years may lead to regulatory governance changes stemming from updated laws, regulation or guidance, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs if we need to make changes to existing facilities. The failure of a tailings dam or tailings storage facility at one of our mine sites could result in severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, lawsuits filed by parties who suffer injuries or property damage from such events, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineral reserves and resources and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock.Our estimates of future production, costs, expenditures and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.We have in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of our future production, costs, expenditures and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on these estimates and projections. Estimates and projections are made by our management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralization, recovery rates, our costs of production, the market prices of gold and silver, our ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and doré and related treatment and refining charges, the sufficiency of our infrastructure, the performance of our personnel and equipment, our ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and our 15compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. We sometimes state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any production, cost, expenditure or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made, and undue reliance should not be placed on them.Our use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market fair value adjustments, potential cash collateral calls and exposure to counterparty credit risk.We have in the past and in the future may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold and silver, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments. We entered into price risk management contracts on 2021, 2022 and 2023 gold sales after a significant increase in gold prices during 2019 and 2020. We determined to implement these contracts to provide for a minimum level of revenue from the sales of the covered gold ounces in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to fund all or a portion of the costs of several significant projects at existing operations such as POA 11 as well as provide greater certainty in our planning and budgeting process. As of December 31, 2022, contracts with respect to 130,500 ounces of gold were outstanding. See Note 15 — Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The use of derivative instruments can expose us to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may require us to post cash or other collateral or have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. Our exposure may be particularly acute for our derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, because those contracts are cash net settled on a monthly basis. The ceiling on the gold ounces covered by the price risk management contracts described above, representing the highest price we could realize for those ounces under outstanding contracts, averages approximately $1,957 per ounce for 2023 production. The price ceiling may be lower than actual spot gold prices at the time of sale under those contracts. In early 2023, the Company added 49,998 ounces of gold forward contracts and 3.2 million ounces of silver forward contracts that settle monthly through December 2023. Taking into account the additional gold and silver hedges added in early 2023 the weighted average fixed price on the forward contracts is $1,961 per ounce of gold and $24.55 per ounce of silver. On February 22, 2023, the closing price of gold and silver was $1,836 and $21.86 per ounce, respectively. We are exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, we could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and other risks associated with implementation and integration. Our information technology systems used in our operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Although the Company has not experienced any material loss to date relating to cybersecurity, there can be no assurance that the Company will not incur such loss in the future.We may be expected to continue enhancing our ESG practices to meet evolving and inconsistent standards. ESG factors, including climate-related initiatives such as GHG emissions targets and climate risk management, are increasingly becoming a metric for institutional shareholders to review and assess the performance of the Company and a significant factor in their investment decisions. We believe we have established ourselves as a leader among peers in ESG and 16continued to advance our ESG initiatives in 2022, including publishing our 2021 ESG Report, which included specific, objective goals to continue to improve our industry leading safety record, reduce the net intensity of our GHG emissions across the Company, build on our commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and protect critical habitat. However, there are no assurances that our efforts will be sufficient or meet the standards set by ESG analysts or institutional or other investors.Our operations may be disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected by an outbreak of infectious disease or  pandemic.An outbreak of infectious disease, pandemic or a similar public health threat, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response thereto, could adversely impact our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and “shelter-in-place” and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend operations at one or more of our mines, which could reduce production, limit exploration activities and development projects and impact liquidity and financial results. While we have implemented several initiatives to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities to date, some of which have and may result in additional costs to us, there can be no assurance that the Company will remain unaffected by potential future health crises.Illnesses or government restrictions, including potential closure of national borders, related to COVID-19 or a similar public health threat may disrupt the supply of raw goods, equipment, supplies and services upon which our operations rely. Third parties with whom we conduct business, including the refiners and smelters that process and, in some cases, purchase the doré and concentrate produced by our mines, are also subject to these risks and may be required to reduce or suspend operations, which could impact our ability to conduct our operations, advance exploration, development and expansion projects, sell our products and generate revenues.To the extent the COVID-19 or any other pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section as well as those contained in the 2021 10-K, such as those relating to our operations and indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 or similar pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the full impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor such situations closely.Our business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees. We may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. We cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose us to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.Continuation of our mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies. Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, our properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to enforcement of water rights, claims and uses, or potential pressure from other users of water, government agencies and officials, and/or non-governmental organizations to limit the amount of water made available to or used for mining activities, regardless of legally valid water rights. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts outside of our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, ongoing litigation to enforce existing water rights, ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights and/or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water could result in our inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining operations and could prevent us from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which 17we operate which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, adversely affecting our existing operations or our expansion or development plans. We may not be able to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets.We have accrued deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions from past operating losses, however, we may not be able to utilize part or all of these assets in the future. We recognize the expected future tax benefit from these assets only if it is considered more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be utilized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, including application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction, assumptions about future metals prices, the macroeconomic environment and results of our operations. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future benefits represented by our deferred tax assets and annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting cash tax liabilities in a future period. RISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING Our future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $515.9 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond our control, including the market prices of gold and silver, among other factors described in this Item. Although we have been successful in repaying or refinancing debt historically, there can be no assurance that we can continue to do so. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments.If and to the extent liquidity resources are insufficient to support short- and long-term expenditures, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, incur additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot predict whether we would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or debt securities or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.The terms of our debt impose restrictions on our operations.The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:•limit our ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;•require us to meet certain financial covenants including a senior secured leverage ratio, a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;•require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, which reduces the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit our ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and•place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.18A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our inability to meet any of these covenants may also result in a lender requiring us to agree to additional restrictive covenants which may, among other things, limit our ability to fund our existing operations or incur additional indebtedness. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of our outstanding debt instruments if any of our debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to us or our debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold and silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding debt securities, our existing debt, and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.RISKS RELATED TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONSWe are subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines under the British Columbia Mines Act and Relevant Sections of the Mexican Official Regulations, and related costs and delays associated with compliance may negatively affect our business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines are regularly inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”). These inspections may lead to written citations or violation notices, which are reported in Exhibit 95.1 to this Report. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general, focusing on miner health and critical safety hazards. Similar inspections are conducted in British Columbia, Canada, at the Silvertip exploration property and in Mexico at the Palmarejo complex by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Mexican Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Secretary of Labor and Social Safety), respectively.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation and environmental justice provisions are evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. We may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require us to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that we have made for such remediation. 19The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that we currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. We cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining waste from our U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, we would be required to make significant expenditures to manage the waste and to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. Under the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (“MEBA”), incidental elemental mercury generated at our Rochester mine as part of the processing of ore may not be exported outside of the United States and is required to be stored in a facility capable for long-term mercury management designated by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”). The DOE is undergoing processes to designate such a facility and to establish storage and handling fees, which is not yet final. The outcome  could result in material cost being incurred to ship and store Coeur Rochester's mercury. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal/indigenous governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on our tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota, in British Columbia (Canada) under the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia, the British Columbia Environmental Management Act and the Canadian Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations, and in Mexico under the General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection of the Environment (the ""GLEBPE"") and the regulations under the GLEBPE related to environmental protection in impact assessment matters.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in the U.S., and are regulated under the Environmental Management Act in British Columbia (Canada) and the GLEBPE and the regulations under GLEBPE related to prevention and control of the pollution of the atmosphere in Mexico. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting our current or future planned activities involving our unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.We are required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. Our ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations may be materially affected by third-party activists.In the normal course of our business, we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects, such as the permits recently obtained for POA 11 at Rochester, POA 1 at Kensington and at Palmarejo to allow the deposit of future tailings into the legacy open pit rather than expand the current tailings impoundment facility. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority and government and third-party sentiment towards the mining industry generally. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed our expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect our revenues and future growth. For example, we experienced prolonged delays by the Mexican federal environmental authority, SEMARNAT, in approving the permit described above to deposit future tailings into the legacy open pit at Palmarejo. As has been publicized in media coverage, we understand that other mining projects in Mexico are also experiencing permitting delays or, in certain circumstances, denials of permits. Any delay in obtaining a permit may require us to revise mine plans or curtail expected production, which could materially adversely affect 20results of operations and cash flow. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects our operations.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third-party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause us to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct our operations will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate.Our business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.We operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws and we provide training and education on these topics to our employees; however, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts or violations of laws committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration (including the current NAFTA arbitration matter involving recovery of Mexican VAT) or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to us, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. We are currently engaged in litigation with a third party regarding the terms of a royalty impacting a portion of the Kensington mine property. While we believe our claims and counter-claims in this matter are valid, litigation matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality and the likely outcome of this matter will be consistent with the ultimate resolution of the matter. Responding to disputes, even those that are without merit or ultimately decided in our favor, may require us to incur significant expense, devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Disputes regarding our mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of our mining projects could adversely impact operations. The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of our property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. We have used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standards, to investigate our title or claims to our various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice we do not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of our exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting our business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising our projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in us losing all or a portion of our right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While we have agreements or are in the process of negotiating 21agreements with the ejidos that impact all of our projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation or legal challenges.The Company’s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in tax laws, mix of earnings and other factors.We are subject to tax laws in the United States and several foreign jurisdictions. U.S. President Biden’s administration (the “Administration”) has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform.The Administration has previously proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income, and other various tax law changes. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.Additionally, the jurisdictions in which we operate have and may in the future continue to encounter financial difficulties resulting from one or both of lower tax revenue and new and increased costs related to continuing to manage COVID-19 or remedy its impact.  National, state or local governments may seek to raise existing taxes or introduce new taxes  which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Currently, the Company incurs losses in certain countries where it does not receive a financial statement benefit, and the Company operates in countries which have different statutory rates. Consequently, changes in the mix and source of earnings between countries could have a material impact on the Company’s overall effective tax rate.In addition, new tax legislation in certain jurisdictions where we operate could negatively affect us. For example, in Nevada, where the Rochester mine and Lincoln Hill project are located, in response to a significant loss of tourism and gaming revenue during 2020, in June 2021 the Governor signed into law a new excise tax on gross proceeds derived from mining gold and silver. In addition, there have been recent proposals by elected officials in Mexico for even more significant increases in mining taxes, although it is unclear whether those proposals will result in legislation. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate will be passed and if passed, the impact of those changes on the Company. Any additional taxes imposed on us could adversely affect our financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of our existing stockholders’ equity ownership. In March 2022 and December 2022, the Company completed $100.0 million and $50.0 million “at the market” offerings of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, respectively, and sold a total of 36.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $4.07 per share.We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends. We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors.22"
1,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2022-02-16,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold and silver, and, if mining and processing operations at Silvertip resume, zinc and lead, and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond our control. Gold, silver, zinc and lead are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, the high and low price for each commodity are set forth in the following table: MetalHigh Price for 2021DateLow Price for 2021DateGold (per ounce)$1,943January 4, 2021$1,684March 30, 2021Silver (per ounce)$29.59February 1, 2021$21.53September 30, 2021Zinc (per pound)$1.74October 15, 2021$1.15February 2, 2021Lead (per pound)$1.13August 18, 2021$0.86March 17, 2021Gold, silver, zinc and lead prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals and base metals, have become significant holders of gold, silver, zinc and lead. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation and governmental monetary decisions regarding central bank holdings.Because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of these metals, our results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower prices would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In response to lower metal price and/or higher treatment and refining charge environments, we may have to revise our operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of our properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. These types of initiatives may not sufficiently offset reductions in revenues, and we may continue to incur losses associated with sustained lower metals prices.Operating costs at our mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, inflation, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.Volatility in metals prices may also impact the price of our outstanding securities.Although our results of operations and cash flow will reflect fluctuations in the prices of the metals we produce, short term volatility in the prices of these metals due to speculation in the market may result in significant changes in the price of our securities which may not be reflective of our operating performance or financial results. For example, the price of silver increased 17% between January 27, 2021 and February 1, 2021, and then decreased by 8% on February 2, 2021. This swing in the price of silver was seemingly attributable to a coordinated effort by market participants to drive up the price of silver and did not reflect changes in the underlying fundamentals that typically drive changes in the price of silver, including supply and demand. The price of our common stock increased by 44% and decreased by 19% during the same periods. The trading volume for shares of our common stock also increased significantly during this period. This volatility in the price of our common stock did not, in our view, reflect any significant change in our business or results of operations during the same period. The estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources may not be realized in actual production. Our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates. The mineral reserve and mineral resource figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom we contract. Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require us to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. Mineral reserve and mineral resource estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead may render mineral 10reserves and mineral resources containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties or write down assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our mines or projects different from those predicted, we may adjust our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates and alter our mining plans. Updates to our mining plans or new or updated technical or geological information may also impact anticipated metal recovery rates. Any of these adjustments may adversely affect actual operating performance, production, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or doré as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We rely on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver doré and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by our mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economical terms is critical to our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. We have existing agreements with refiners and smelters, some of which operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States. We believe we currently have contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact our operations or our ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, shipping delays, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create (or the necessity to terminate) a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave us with limited, uneconomical or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters may also impact refiners, smelters or other third parties with whom we have contractual arrangements or have an indirect effect on our ability to obtain refining, smelting or other third-party services. Any delay or loss of access to refiners or smelters may significantly impact our ability to sell doré and concentrate products and generate revenues. A default by a refiner or smelter on its contractual obligations to us or an insolvency event or bankruptcy filing by a refiner or smelter may result in the loss of all or part of our doré or concentrate in the possession of the refiner or smelter, and such a loss likely would not be insured by our insurance policies. We cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or machine failure. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.We maintain insurance policies that protect against property loss and business interruption in amounts that we believe are reasonable taking into account the nature of, and risks related to, our business and operations as well as the cost of policy premiums. Such insurance is, however, subject to certain exclusions, and there is no guarantee that we will receive insurance proceeds with respect to a particular event or loss. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that we incur for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSOur future growth will depend upon our ability to expand existing mines and develop and start-up new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies or properties. Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, our ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing and expanding existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development and start-up of new mining properties, such as the Silvertip development property, the Sterling/Crown project and the Lincoln Hill project and related assets.While initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. Palmarejo completed open pit mining several years ago and evolved to be an underground-only operation, developing new underground mining operations. At Rochester, a crushing circuit using high pressure grinding roll (“HPGR”) technology was commissioned in 2019, and, in 2020, we obtained permitting for, and began construction of POA 11, which is a significant additional expansion, including the 11construction of a new leach pad, a crushing facility equipped with two HPGR units and a prescreen, processing facilities and related infrastructure to support the extension of Rochester’s mine life. At Kensington, we completed development and commenced commercial production from a new deposit in 2018 and are currently seeking to amend our operating permit to allow for an additional 10 years of mine life by providing for expanded tailings and waste rock storage, increased mill throughput, enhanced infrastructure and other benefits (“POA 1”). Our ability to timely complete these and future mine expansion and mine life extension projects is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, availability of funding on acceptable terms, timing of receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities, extreme weather events, obtaining materials and equipment and construction, engineering and other services at favorable prices and terms, and disputes with third-party providers of materials, equipment or services. The construction services related to POA 11 will be performed by contractors, which creates a risk of delays or additional costs to the project resulting from, among other factors:  inability to negotiate contracts with favorable pricing and terms; delays in performance of the services; failure of a contractor to comply with applicable laws and regulations; termination of a contract by a contractor before completion of the services; failure by a contractor to obtain necessary equipment or materials; mismanagement by a contractor of its workforce; and insolvency or other financial difficulty encountered by a contractor which results in a delay in services or termination of a contract with the contractor. Expected project benefits are based on estimates of a variety of key factors, including mineral reserves and resources, grade, recovery rates, and operating costs among others.  However, achieving results in line with those estimates is subject to risks and uncertainties such as variability in grade, recovery rates and cost inputs.  In 2021, Rochester experienced lower than expected silver recovery rates from its HPGR-crushed ore, which negatively impacted production, costs and cash flow. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully expand or extend the lives of existing mining operations, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefit, such as expected availability, throughput, metal recovery rates, concentrate quality, unit costs, operating margin and/or cash flows, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.In addition, we acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Sterling/Crown project, the Lincoln Hill project and related assets and the Silvertip development property. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and start-up new mining properties, restart mining and processing activities at the Silvertip development property or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.We regularly evaluate and engage in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that we contemplate or pursue would involve risks and uncertainties and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.Our operations may be further disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, poses a material risk to our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and “shelter-in-place” and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend operations at one or more of our mines, which could reduce production, limit exploration activities and development projects and impact liquidity and financial results. In addition, we have implemented several initiatives to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities during this pandemic, including COVID-19 testing, site access symptom checks, contact tracing technology and procuring additional disinfectant and sanitation products and personal protective equipment for our employees, among others, some of which have and may result in additional costs to us.Illnesses or government restrictions, including the closure of national borders, related to COVID-19 also may disrupt the supply of raw goods, equipment, supplies and services upon which our operations rely. We also continue to monitor legislative initiatives in the U.S., Mexico and Canada related to COVID-19 to determine their potential impacts or benefits (if any) to our business.Third parties with whom we conduct business, including the refiners and smelters that, process and, in some cases, purchase the gold and silver doré and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by our mines, are also subject to these risks and may be required to reduce or suspend operations, which could impact our ability to conduct our operations, advance exploration, development and expansion projects, sell our products and generate revenues.We may be subject to litigation if one or more employees or contractors contract COVID-19 at work or litigation initiated by stockholders who view decisions by the Board of Directors or management as inconsistent with duties to the Company under Delaware law or who may assert claims under federal securities laws. We understand that, as indicated by sharp increases in average premiums for director and officer insurance policies in recent months, insurers expect increased litigation relating to COVID-19.The jurisdictions in which we operate have and may in the future continue to encounter financial difficulties resulting from one or both of lower tax revenue and new and increased costs related to COVID-19. As a result, national, state or local 12governments may seek to raise existing taxes or introduce new taxes that affect our business, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, in Nevada, where the Rochester mine, Sterling/Crown project and Lincoln Hill project are located, in response to a significant loss of tourism and gaming revenue during 2020, in June 2021 the Governor signed into law a new excise tax on gross proceeds derived from mining gold and silver.To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section as well as those contained in the 2020 10-K, such as those relating to our operations and indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the full impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.We may be unable to successfully integrate and may not realize the expected benefits of recent or future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions (including the Silvertip development property and the Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects) or any future acquisition, will be realized on the originally anticipated timeline or at all. The success and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend upon our ability to effectively manage the integration, performance and operations of entities or properties we acquire. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen challenges and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources, which may divert focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and/or from operational matters during this process. As an example, the ramp up of the Silvertip development property, acquired in late 2017, was slower and less profitable than originally anticipated, due primarily to more significant mill availability and maintenance challenges than were anticipated at the time Silvertip was acquired. In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in macroeconomic conditions, including commodity prices, treatment and refining charges or stock prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;•additional debt incurred or issued to fund some or all of acquisition consideration (as was the case with Silvertip and Wharf), resulting in increased interest expense and other borrowing costs;•issuance of equity securities as acquisition consideration (which occurred in the Sterling/Crown, Lincoln Hill and Silvertip project acquisitions), resulting in dilution of our existing stockholders;•a material ore body may prove to be below our expectations;•processing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment, such as the mill at Silvertip;•difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies and supporting expanded operations, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization;•difficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous people; and•the acquired business or assets may have significant liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that we failed to discover or have underestimated.We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our common stock or assure that we will be able to obtain necessary acquisition or development financing on acceptable terms or at all. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional liabilities, indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any future mine development, may negatively affect our results of operations.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business. Our ability to sustain or increase current production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Our plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations, including the POA 11 expansion project at Rochester and the POA 1 planned mine life extension at Kensington, and future plans to develop the Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects. These projects can take up to several 13months or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks described in this Item, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.Mineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects, such as the Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.We may be required to write down certain long-lived assets, due to metal prices, operational challenges or other factors. Such write- downs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We review our long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, we review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as our mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. We conduct a review of the financial performance of our mines in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for each reported period and determine whether any triggering events are indicated.For example, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the Silvertip property and determined that indicators of impairment existed, and we ultimately concluded that the carrying value of the long-lived assets for the Silvertip property was impaired, and a non-cash impairment charge of $250.8 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019. If there are further significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if we fail to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, we may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of our assets. Any such actions would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may record other types of charges in the future if we sell a property or asset for a price less than its carrying value or have to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties or other assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Coeur is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.A significant portion of our revenues are generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond our control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to our business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which we, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. As an example, as disclosed in Note 20 -- Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated 14Financial Statements, we are currently engaged in efforts to recover VAT paid to the Mexican government that is owed to Coeur associated with Coeur Mexicana’s prior royalty agreement, including through ongoing litigation and potential international arbitration. While the Company believes that it remains legally entitled to be refunded the full amount of the VAT receivable and intends to rigorously continue its VAT recovery efforts, based on the continued failure to recover the VAT receivable and recent unfavorable Mexican court decisions, the Company determined to write down the carrying value of the VAT receivable of $26.0 million at September 2021. The right to import and export gold, silver, zinc and lead may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, our rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require us to curtail or terminate operations at our mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks.Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions, as well as epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters, can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of our foreign operations, including drug cartel-related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect our ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are not uncommon in areas in Mexico where our operations or projects are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. We cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect our business.We sell silver and gold doré, gold concentrate, and silver, zinc and lead concentrates in U.S. dollars, but we conduct operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect our results of operations.Our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.  Our ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding our operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of our properties, and other stakeholders in our operating locations. We believe our operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, we seek to maintain our partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding our ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with our activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against us or our operations. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities.  No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Waste rock in the form of tailings generated as a by-product of processed ore is produced at the Kensington and Palmarejo Mines. We place tailings into engineered containments, underground as structural backfill, and as a dry stack material. In response to several recent tailings dam failures unrelated to our operations that have involved loss of life and resulted in severe property and environmental ecosystem damage, we completed a comprehensive review of our tailings dams 15and operational practices to characterize our risk profile. We concluded that our tailings dams represent a low exposure risk profile for several reasons, including that our tailings dams were constructed using construction methods recognized in the industry as the most stable tailings dam design using high strength and chemically stable rock in construction. Our dams are continuously monitored and inspected by internal resources as well as third-party industry qualified experts.  The significant dam failure events that have occurred in recent years may lead to regulatory governance changes stemming from updated laws, regulation or guidance, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs if we need to make changes to existing facilities. The failure of a tailings dam or tailings storage facility at one of our mine sites could result in severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, lawsuits filed by parties who suffer injuries or property damage from such events, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineral reserves and resources and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock.Our estimates of future production, costs, expenditures and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.We have in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of our future production, costs, expenditures and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on these estimates and projections. Estimates and projections are made by our management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralization, recovery rates, our costs of production, the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, our ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and doré and related treatment and refining charges, the sufficiency of our infrastructure, the performance of our personnel and equipment, our ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and our compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. We sometimes state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any production, cost, expenditure or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made, and undue reliance should not be placed on them.Our use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark- to-market fair value adjustments, potential cash collateral calls and exposure to counterparty credit risk.From time-to-time, we have in the past and in the future may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, zinc and lead, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, we entered into price risk management contracts on a total of 483,700 ounces of expected gold production for 2020, 2021 and 2022 after a significant increase in gold prices during 2019 and 2020. We determined to implement these contracts to provide for a minimum level of revenue from the sales of the covered gold ounces in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to fund all or a portion of the costs of several significant projects at existing operations such as POA 11. As of December 31, 2021, contracts with respect to 132,000 ounces of gold were outstanding. See Note 16 — Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The use of derivative instruments can expose us to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may require us to post cash or other collateral or have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. Our exposure may be particularly acute for our derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, because those contracts are cash net settled on a monthly basis. The ceiling on the gold ounces covered by the price risk management contracts described above, representing the highest price we could realize for those ounces under outstanding contracts, averages approximately $2,038 per ounce for 2022 production. The price ceiling may be lower than actual spot gold prices at the time of sale under those contracts. On February 14, 2022, the closing price of gold was $1,866 per ounce. We are exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, we could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and other risks associated with implementation and integration. Our information technology systems used in our operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in 16design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Our business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees. We may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. We cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose us to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.Continuation of our mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies. Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, our properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to enforcement of water rights, claims and uses, or potential pressure from other users of water, government agencies and officials, and/or non-governmental organizations to limit the amount of water made available to or used for mining activities, regardless of legally valid water rights. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts outside of our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, ongoing litigation to enforce existing water rights, ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights and/or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water could result in our inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining operations and could prevent us from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, adversely affecting our existing operations or our expansion or development plans. We may not be able to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets.We have accrued deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions from past operating losses, however, we may not be able to utilize part or all of these assets in the future. We recognize the expected future tax benefit from these assets only if it is considered more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be utilized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, including application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction, assumptions about future metals prices, the macroeconomic environment and results of our operations. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future benefits represented by our deferred tax assets and annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting cash tax liabilities in a future period. 17RISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING Our future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $487.5 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond our control, including the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, among other factors described in this Item. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments.If our cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot predict whether we would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or debt securities or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.The terms of our debt impose restrictions on our operations.The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:•limit our ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;•require us to meet certain financial covenants consisting of a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;•require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, which reduces the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit our ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and•place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our inability to meet any of these covenants may also result in a lender requiring us to agree to additional restrictive covenants which may, among other things, limit our ability to fund our existing operations or incur additional indebtedness. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of our outstanding debt instruments if any of our debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to us or our debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold and silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the 18value of our outstanding debt securities, our existing debt, and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.RISKS RELATED TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONSWe are subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines under the British Columbia Mines Act and Relevant Sections of the Mexican Official Regulations, and related costs and delays associated with compliance may negatively affect our business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines and Sterling/Crown project are frequently inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general. Similar inspections are conducted in British Columbia, Canada, at the Silvertip development property and in Mexico at the Palmarejo complex by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Mexican Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Secretary of Labor and Social Safety), respectively.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. We may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require us to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that we have made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that we currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. We cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining waste from our U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, we would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. Under the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (“MEBA”), incidental elemental mercury generated at our Rochester mine as part of the processing of ore may not be exported outside of the United States and is required to be stored in a storage facility designated by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”). Near the end of 2019, the DOE designated a facility and issued a long-term management and storage fee rule; however, the facility designation process and fee was subjected to legal challenges by us and other third parties. Following legal challenges by Coeur and others, the DOE agreed to vacate the 2019 rule and commence a new rule making process in 2021. The future rule could result in material cost being incurred to ship 19and store Coeur Rochester's mercury. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal/indigenous governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on our tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota, in British Columbia (Canada) under the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia, the British Columbia Environmental Management Act and the Canadian Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations, and in Mexico under the General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection of the Environment (the ""GLEBPE"") and the regulations under the GLEBPE related to environmental protection in impact assessment matters. In addition, proposed CERCLA regulations requiring mining companies to obtain supplemental financial assurance could, if adopted, have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota, and are regulated under the Environmental Management Act in British Columbia (Canada) and the GLEBPE and the regulations under GLEBPE related to prevention and control of the pollution of the atmosphere in Mexico. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting our current or future planned activities involving our unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.We are required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. Our ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations may be materially affected by third-party activists.In the normal course of our business, we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects, such as the permits recently obtained for POA 11 at Rochester and the permitting effort currently underway for POA 1 at Kensington. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed our expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect our revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects our operations.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third-party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause us to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct our operations will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate.If future permitting applications or amendments are not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, our plans for continued operations and future growth could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 20Our business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.We operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts or violations of laws committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to us, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Disputes regarding our mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of our mining projects could adversely impact operations. The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of our property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. We have used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standards, to investigate our title or claims to our various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice we do not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of our exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting our business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising our projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in us losing all or a portion of our right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While we have agreements or are in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of our projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation or legal challenges.The Company’s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in tax laws, mix of earnings and other factors.We are subject to tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. U.S. President Biden’s administration (the “Administration”) has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform.The Administration has previously proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income, and other various tax law changes. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.Currently, the Company incurs losses in certain countries where it does not receive a financial statement benefit, and the Company operates in countries which have different statutory rates. Consequently, changes in the mix and source of earnings between countries could have a material impact on the Company’s overall effective tax rate.In addition, new tax legislation in certain jurisdictions where we operate could negatively affect us. For example, in Nevada, where the Rochester mine, Sterling/Crown project and Lincoln Hill project are located, in response to a significant loss of tourism and gaming revenue during 2020, in June 2021 the Governor signed into law a new excise tax on gross proceeds 21derived from mining gold and silver. In addition, there have been recent proposals by elected officials in Mexico for even more significant increases in mining taxes, although it is unclear whether those proposals will result in legislation. It is difficult to predict whether proposed changes to tax laws in the jurisdictions where we operate will be passed and if passed, the impact of those changes on the Company. Any additional taxes imposed on us could adversely affect our financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of our existing stockholders’ equity ownership. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends. We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors.22"
13,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2021-02-17,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYOur results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold and silver, and, if mining and processing operations at Silvertip resume, zinc and lead, and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond our control. Gold, silver, zinc and lead are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, the high and low price for each commodity are set forth in the following table: MetalLow Price for 2020DateHigh Price for 2020DateGold (per ounce)$1,474March 19, 2020$2,067August 6, 2020Silver (per ounce)$12.00March 19, 2020$28.89September 1, 2020Zinc (per pound)$0.82March 24, 2020$1.29December 18, 2020Lead (per pound)$0.71March 24, 2020$0.95December 9, 2020Gold, silver, zinc and lead prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, the price of products that incorporate gold, silver, zinc or lead, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals and base metals, have become significant holders of gold, silver, zinc and lead. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation and governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles.Because we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales of these metals, our results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower prices, would materially and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In response to lower metal price and/or higher treatment and refining charge environments, we may have to revise our operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of our properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. These types of initiatives may not sufficiently offset reductions in revenues, and we may continue to incur losses associated with sustained lower metals prices.Operating costs at our mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.Volatility in metals prices may also impact the price of our outstanding securities.Although our results of operations and cash flow will reflect fluctuations in the prices of the metals we produce, short term volatility in the prices of these metals due to speculation in the market may result in significant changes in the price of our securities which may not be reflective of our operating performance or financial results. For example, the price of silver increased 17% between January 27, 2021 and February 1, 2021, and then decreased by 8% on February 2, 2021. This swing in the price of silver was seemingly attributable to a coordinated effort by market participants to drive up the price of silver and did not reflect changes in the underlying fundamentals that typically drive changes in the price of silver, including supply and demand. The price of our common stock increased by 44%  and decreased by 19% during the same periods. The trading volume for shares of our common stock also increased significantly during this period. This volatility in the price of our common stock did not, in our view, reflect any significant change in our business or results of operations during the same period. The estimation of mineral reserves and mineralized material is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineralized material may not be realized in actual production. Our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates. The mineral reserve and mineralized material figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom we contract. Mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require us to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. Mineral reserve and mineralized material estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to 10great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead may render mineral reserves and mineralized material containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties or write down assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our mines or projects different from those predicted, we may adjust our mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates and alter our mining plans. Updates to our mining plans or new or updated technical or geological information may also impact anticipated metal recovery rates. Any of these adjustments may adversely affect actual operating performance, production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or doré as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We rely on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver doré and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by our mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economical terms is critical to our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. We have existing agreements with refiners and smelters, some of which operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States, and we believe we currently have contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact our operations or our ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave us with limited, uneconomical or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters may also impact refiners, smelters or other third parties with whom we have contractual arrangements or have an indirect effect on our ability to obtain refining, smelting or other third-party services. Any delay or loss of access to refiners or smelters may significantly impact our ability to sell doré and concentrate products and generate revenues. A default by a refiner or smelter on its contractual obligations to us or an insolvency event or bankruptcy filing by a refiner or smelter may result in the loss of all or part of our doré or concentrate in the possession of the refiner or smelter, and such a loss likely would not be insured by our insurance policies. We cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or machine failure, such as the failure of the secondary crusher in Rochester’s new crushing circuit in 2019, which impacted crushing rates. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.We maintain insurance policies that protect against property loss and business interruption in amounts that we believe are reasonable taking into account the nature of, and risks related to, our business and operations as well as the cost of policy premiums. Such insurance is, however, subject to certain exclusions, and there is no guarantee that we will receive insurance proceeds with respect to a particular event or loss. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that we incur for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSOur future growth will depend upon our ability to expand existing mines and develop and start-up new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies or properties. Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, our ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing and expanding existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development and start-up of new mining properties, such as the Silvertip mine, the Sterling/Crown project and the Lincoln Hill project and related assets.While initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. Palmarejo completed open pit mining several years ago and evolved to be an underground-only operation, developing two new underground mining 11operations. At Rochester, a crushing circuit using high pressure grinding roll (“HPGR”) technology was commissioned in 2019, and, in 2020, we obtained permitting for, and began construction of POA 11, which is a significant additional expansion, including the construction of a new leach pad, a crushing facility equipped with two HPGR units, processing facilities and related infrastructure to support the extension of Rochester’s mine life. At Kensington, we completed development and commenced commercial production from a new deposit in 2018 and are currently seeking to amend our operating permit to allow for an additional 10 years of mine life by providing for expanded tailings and waste rock storage, increased mill throughput, enhanced infrastructure and other benefits (“POA 1”). Our ability to timely complete these and future mine expansion and mine life extension projects is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, availability of funding on acceptable terms, timing of receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities, extreme weather events, obtaining materials and equipment and construction, engineering and other services at favorable prices and terms, and disputes with third-party providers of materials, equipment or services. The construction services related to POA 11 will be performed by contractors, which creates a risk of delays or additional costs to the project resulting from, among other factors:  inability to negotiate contracts with favorable pricing and terms; delays in performance of the services; failure of a contractor to comply with applicable laws and regulations; termination of a contract by a contractor before completion of the services; failure by a contractor to obtain necessary equipment or materials; mismanagement by a contractor of its workforce; and insolvency or other financial difficulty encountered by a contractor which results in a delay in services or termination of a contract with the contractor. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully expand or extend the lives of existing mining operations, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefit, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.In addition, we acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Sterling/Crown project, the Lincoln Hill project and related assets and the Silvertip mine. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully develop and start-up new mining properties, restart mining and processing activities at the Silvertip mine or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.We regularly evaluate and engage in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that we contemplate or pursue would involve risks and uncertainties and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.Our operations may be further disrupted, and our financial results may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, poses a material risk to our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and “shelter-in-place” and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend operations at one or more of our mines, which occurred at our Palmarejo complex in the second quarter of 2020 and at the Kensington mine in the third quarter of 2020, which could reduce production, limit exploration activities and development projects and impact liquidity and financial results. In addition, we have implemented several initiatives to protect the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities during this pandemic, including COVID-19 testing, pre-shift quarantine requirements, site access symptom checks, contact tracing technology and procuring additional disinfectant and sanitation products and personal protective equipment for our employees, among others, some of which may result in additional costs to us. For example, we continue to require all employees who travel to the Kensington mine to submit to a quarantine before traveling to the mine and a testing protocol before travel to Juneau, Alaska, before traveling from Juneau to the mine and while at the mine site. We believe this is an important step to protect the health and safety of all workers who stay at the Kensington camp, although it has required changes to worker scheduling and is expected to result in higher labor costs due to additional overtime pay and pay during the quarantine period.Illnesses or government restrictions, including the closure of national borders, related to COVID-19 also may disrupt the supply of raw goods, equipment, supplies and services upon which our operations rely. We also continue to monitor legislative initiatives in the U.S., Mexico and Canada to provide relief to businesses impacted by COVID-19 to determine their potential impacts or benefits (if any) to our business.The refiners and smelters upon which we rely to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase the gold and silver doré and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by our mines, are also subject to these risks and may be required to reduce or suspend operations, which could impact our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. For example, in the first quarter of 2020, Argor-Heraeus, a Swiss refiner which provides refining services to several of our mines, announced that it was temporarily suspending operations in response to a government order. Following the temporary suspension, Argor-Heraeus recommenced operations.12We may be subject to litigation if one or more employees contract COVID-19 at work or litigation initiated by stockholders who view decisions by the Board of Directors or management as inconsistent with duties to the Company under Delaware law or who may assert claims under federal securities laws. We understand that, as indicated by sharp increases in average premiums for director and officer insurance policies in recent months, insurers expect increased litigation relating to COVID-19.The jurisdictions in which we operate have and may in the future continue to encounter financial difficulties resulting from one or both of lower tax revenue and new and increased costs related to COVID-19. As a result, national, state or local governments may seek to raise existing taxes or introduce new taxes that affect our business, which may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, the state legislature of Nevada, where the Rochester mine, Sterling/Crown project and Lincoln Hill project are located, in response to a significant loss of tourism and gaming revenue during 2020, is considering an increase to the existing Nevada Net Proceeds Tax (“NNPT”) on net revenue, or conversion to a tax on gross proceeds, derived from mining. Any increase to the NNPT or conversion to a gross proceeds tax requires approval of two-thirds of members of both legislative houses in two consecutive legislative sessions followed by majority approval of Nevada voters on a statewide ballot. In addition, there have been recent proposals by elected officials in Mexico for significant increases in mining taxes, although it is unclear whether those proposals will result in legislation.To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section, such as those relating to our operations and indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the full impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.We may be unable to successfully integrate and may not realize the expected benefits of recent or future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions (including the Silvertip mine and the Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects) or any future acquisition, will be realized on the originally anticipated timeline or at all. The success and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend upon our ability to effectively manage the integration, performance and operations of entities or properties we acquire. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen challenges and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources, which may divert focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and/or from operational matters during this process. As an example, the ramp up of the Silvertip mine, acquired in late 2017, was slower and less profitable than originally anticipated, due primarily to more significant mill availability and maintenance challenges than were anticipated at the time Silvertip was acquired. Silvertip temporarily suspended mining and processing activities (unrelated to COVID-19) in February 2020 due to the foregoing reasons as well as a significant decrease in the prices of lead and zinc and a significant increase in treatment costs for lead and zinc. In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in macroeconomic conditions, including commodity prices, treatment and refining charges or stock prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;•additional debt incurred or issued to fund some or all of acquisition consideration (as was the case with Silvertip and Wharf), resulting in increased interest expense and other borrowing costs;•issuance of equity securities as acquisition consideration (which occurred in the Sterling/Crown, Lincoln Hill and Silvertip project acquisitions), resulting in dilution of our existing stockholders;•a material ore body may prove to be below our expectations;•processing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment, such as the mill at Silvertip;•difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization;•difficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous people; and•the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant.We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our common stock or assure that we will be able to obtain necessary acquisition or development financing on acceptable terms or at all. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional 13indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any future mine development, may negatively affect our results of operations.Finally, our systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from an acquisition or development of a new mine. Our future operating results could be affected by the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and integrate an acquired business or new operation into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that we failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with any acquisition or development. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or future prospects.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business. Our ability to sustain or increase current production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Our plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations, including the POA 11 expansion project at Rochester and POA 1 planned mine-life extension at Kensington, and future plans to develop the Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects. These projects can take up to several months or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. For example, the capital costs associated with the POA 11 expansion project in 2021 through 2023 are anticipated to be $396.8 million. These projects are subject to significant risks, including delays, extreme weather events, unexpected increases in the cost of required materials, and disputes with third-party providers of materials, equipment or services, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefit, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.Mineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects, such as the La Preciosa, Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.We may be required to write down certain long-lived assets, due to metal prices, operational challenges or other factors. Such write- downs may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We review our long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, we review the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as our mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. We conduct a review of the financial performance of our mines in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for each reported period and determine whether any triggering events are indicated.For example, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the Silvertip property and determined that indicators of impairment existed, primarily as a result of continued deterioration in zinc and lead market conditions as well as ongoing challenges related to the processing facility. As a result of the impairment indicators, a 14recoverability test was performed and we concluded that the carrying value of the long-lived assets for the Silvertip property was impaired, and a non-cash impairment charge of $250.8 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019. The write-down was allocated between Property, plant and equipment, net, Mining properties, net and Other non-current assets, in the amounts of $43.6 million, $201.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively.  See Note 4 -- Impairment of Long-lived Assets and 16 -- Fair Value Measurements for additional detail of the assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the long-lived assets tested for impairment. In prior years, our assessment of the recoverability of our long-lived assets resulted in other write-downs in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on our balance sheet. See Note 2 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.If there are further significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if we fail to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, we may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of our assets. Any such actions would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We may record other types of charges in the future if we sell a property or asset for a price less than its carrying value or have to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties or other assets could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Coeur is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.A significant portion of our revenues are generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond our control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to our business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which we, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. As an example, as disclosed in Note 21 -- Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are currently engaged in efforts to recover VAT paid to the Mexican government that is owed to Coeur associated with Coeur Mexicana’s prior royalty agreement, including through ongoing litigation. In addition, in November 2020 the President of Mexico introduced legislation that would limit outsourcing by companies in Mexico of certain services. If enacted, the proposed law is expected to result in increased costs to our operations in Mexico, including additional tax expense, increased compensation to certain employees and costs associated with restructuring our Mexican subsidiaries and employment arrangements to comply with the new law. The right to import and export gold, silver, zinc and lead may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, our rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require us to curtail or terminate operations at our mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks.Our operations outside the United States also expose us to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions, as well as epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters, can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of our foreign operations, including drug cartel-related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect our ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are not uncommon in areas in Mexico where our operations or projects are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. We cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect our business.15We sell silver and gold doré, gold concentrate, and silver, zinc and lead concentrates in U.S. dollars, but we conduct operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect our results of operations.Our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.  Our ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding our operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of our properties, and other stakeholders in our operating locations. We believe our operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, we seek to maintain our partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding our ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with our activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against us or our operations. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Like any mining company, our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities.  No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Waste rock in the form of tailings generated as a by-product of processed ore is produced at the Kensington, Palmarejo, and Silvertip Mines. We place tailings into engineered containments, underground as structural backfill, and as a dry stack material. In response to several recent tailings dam failures unrelated to our operations that have involved loss of life and resulted in severe property and environmental ecosystem damage, we completed a comprehensive review of our tailings dams and operational practices to characterize our risk profile. We concluded that our tailings dams represent a low exposure risk profile for several reasons, including that our tailings dams were constructed using construction methods recognized in the industry as the most stable tailings dam design using high strength and chemically stable rock in construction. Our dams are continuously monitored and inspected by internal resources as well as third-party industry qualified experts.  The significant dam failure events that have occurred in recent years may lead to regulatory governance changes stemming from updated laws, regulation or guidance, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs if we need to make changes to existing facilities. The failure of a tailings dam or tailings storage facility at one of our mine sites could result in severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, lawsuits filed by parties who suffer injuries or property damage from such events, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineralized material and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock.Our estimates of future production, costs, expenditures and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.We have in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of our future production, costs, expenditures and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on these estimates and projections. Estimates and projections are made by our management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralized material, our costs of production, the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, our ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and doré and related treatment and refining charges, the sufficiency of our infrastructure, the performance of our personnel and equipment, our ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and our compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. We sometimes state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any production, cost, expenditure or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 16Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made, and undue reliance should not be placed on them.Our use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark- to-market fair value adjustments, potential cash collateral calls and exposure to counterparty credit risk.From time-to-time, we have in the past and in the future may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, zinc and lead, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments. In 2019 and 2020, we entered into price risk management contracts on a total of 477,700 ounces of expected gold production for 2020, 2021 and 2022 after a significant increase in gold prices during 2019 and 2020. We determined to implement these contracts to provide for a minimum level of revenue from the sales of the covered gold ounces in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to fund all or a portion of the costs of several significant projects at existing operations such as POA 11. As of December 31, 2020, contracts with respect to 284,700 ounces of gold were outstanding. See Note 17 — Derivative Financial Instruments in the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.The use of derivative instruments can expose us to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may require us to post cash or other collateral or have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. Our exposure may be particularly acute for our derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges, because those contracts are cash net settled on a monthly basis. The ceiling on the gold ounces covered by the price risk management contracts described above, representing the highest price we could realize for those ounces under outstanding contracts, averages approximately $1,875 per ounce for 2021 production and $2,030 per ounce for 2022 production. The price ceiling may be lower than actual spot gold prices at the time of sale under those contracts. On February 15, 2021, the closing price of gold was $1,817 per ounce. We are exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, we could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.We are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration. Our information technology systems used in our operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.We face increased cybersecurity risks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, a portion of our workforce is working remotely to facilitate social distancing, and these employees may transmit data using unsecured internet connections despite training advising of those risks. In addition, our employees have faced increases in phishing and malware attacks and socially engineered cyberattacks which, in some cases, attempt to use the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems.We could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.Our business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees. We may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. We cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose us to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.17We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.Continuation of our mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies. Our mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, our properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of our operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water (or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in our inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent us from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting our operations.We may not be able to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assetsWe have accrued deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions from past operating losses, however, we may not be able to utilize part or all of these assets in the future. We recognize the expected future tax benefit from these assets only if it is considered more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be utilized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, including application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction, assumptions about future metals prices, the macroeconomic environment and results of our operations. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets in the United States are also subject to limitation if we experience a change in stock ownership in accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Management has determined that we experienced ownership changes, for purposes of Section 382, during 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2015. Based on management’s calculations, we do not expect any of our deferred tax assets to expire unused as a result of the Section 382 annual limitations. However, the annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting cash tax liabilities in a future period. RISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING Our future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $275.5 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond our control, including the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments.If our cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot predict whether we would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or debt securities or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. In addition, the interest rate for our senior secured revolving credit facility (“RCF”), pursuant to a Credit Agreement entered into on September 29, 2017 among us, as borrower, certain of our subsidiaries, as guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and Bank of America, N.A., Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Montreal, Chicago Branch, the Bank of Nova Scotia and ING Capital LLC, as lenders, is determined, at our option, by the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), and we and our lenders may not be able to agree to a new benchmark interest rate before LIBOR is expected to be eliminated by the end of 2021, which may result in higher interest costs for us. The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it 18becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of our common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.The terms of our debt impose restrictions on our operations.The agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:•limit our ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;•require us to meet certain financial covenants consisting of a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;•require a portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, which reduces the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit our ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and•place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing our outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our inability to meet any of these covenants may also result in a lender requiring us to agree to additional restrictive covenants which may, among other things, limit our ability to fund our existing operations or incur additional indebtedness. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of our outstanding debt instruments if any of our debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to us or our debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to us or our debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If we are unable to maintain our outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should our business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold and silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of our outstanding debt securities, our existing debt, and our ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under our existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.RISKS RELATED TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONSWe are subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines under the British Columbia Mines Act and Relevant Sections of the Mexican Official Regulations, and related costs and delays associated with compliance may negatively affect our business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could 19cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines and Sterling/Crown project are frequently inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general. Similar inspections are conducted in British Columbia, Canada, at the Silvertip mine and in Mexico at the Palmarejo complex by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Mexican Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Secretary of Labor and Social Safety), respectively.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. We may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require us to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that we have made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that we currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. We cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining waste from our U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, we would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. Under the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (“MEBA”), incidental elemental mercury generated at our Rochester mine as part of the processing of ore may not be exported outside of the United States and is required to be stored in a storage facility designated by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”). Near the end of 2019, the DOE designated a facility and issued a long-term management and storage fee rule; however, the facility designation process and fee was subjected to legal challenges by us and other third parties. Following legal challenges by Coeur and others, the DOE agreed to vacate the 2019 rule and commence a new rulemaking process, which is pending. The future rule could result in material cost being incurred to ship and store Coeur Rochester's mercury. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal/indigenous governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on our tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota, in British Columbia (Canada) under the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines in British Columbia, the British Columbia Environmental Management Act and the Canadian Metal and Diamond Mining Effluent Regulations, and in Mexico under the General Law of Ecological Balance and Protection of the Environment (the ""GLEBPE"") and the regulations under the GLEBPE related to environmental protection in impact assessment matters. In addition, proposed CERCLA 20regulations requiring mining companies to obtain supplemental financial assurance could, if adopted, have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota, and are regulated under the Environmental Management Act in British Columbia (Canada) and the GLEBPE and the regulations under GLEBPE related to prevention and control of the pollution of the atmosphere in Mexico. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting our current or future planned activities involving our unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.We are required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. Our ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations may be materially affected by third-party activists.In the normal course of our business, we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects, such as the permits recently obtained for POA 11 at Rochester and the permitting effort currently underway for POA 1 at Kensington. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within our control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. We may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed our expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect our revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects our operations.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third-party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause us to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, our ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct our operations will likely depend on our ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. Our ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with our activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which we operate.If future permitting applications or amendments are not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, our plans for continued operations and future growth could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.We operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts or violations of laws committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. We are subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.We are currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to us, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against us in the future, could have a 21material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. In the event of a dispute arising at our foreign operations, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. Our inability to enforce our rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.Disputes regarding our mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of our mining projects could adversely impact operations. The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of our property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. We have used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standards, to investigate our title or claims to our various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice we do not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of our exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting our business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising our projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in us losing all or a portion of our right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While we have agreements or are in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of our projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation or legal challenges.The Company’s effective tax rate could be volatile and materially change as a result of changes in tax laws, mix of earnings and other factors.We are subject to tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. U.S. President Biden’s administration (the “Administration”) has called for changes to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform.The Administration has previously proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, doubling the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income, and other various tax law changes. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a negative impact on the Company’s effective tax rate.Currently, the Company incurs losses in certain countries where it does not receive a financial statement benefit, and the Company operates in countries which have different statutory rates. Consequently, changes in the mix and source of earnings between countries could have a material impact on the Company’s overall effective tax rate.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKWe have the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of our existing stockholders’ equity ownership. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. If we issue additional equity securities, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends. We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay 22dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors.23"
15,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2020-02-19,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYThe Company’s results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond the Company’s control. Gold, silver, zinc and lead are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the high and low price for each commodity are set forth in the following table: MetalLow Price for 2019DateHigh Price for 2019DateGold (per ounce)$1,269.50April 23, 2019$1,546.10September 4, 2019Silver (per ounce)$14.38May 29, 2019$19.31September 4, 2019Zinc (per pound)$1.00September 3, 2019$1.37April 1, 2019Lead (per pound)$0.80May 14, 2019$1.03October 29, 2019Gold, silver, zinc and lead prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, the price of products that incorporate gold, silver, zinc or lead, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals and base metals, have become significant holders of gold, silver, zinc and lead. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation and governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles.Because the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of gold, silver, zinc and lead, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices and, to a lesser extent, zinc and lead prices, would materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. In response to lower metal price and/or higher treatment and refining charge environments, the Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. These types of initiatives may not sufficiently offset reductions in revenues, and the Company may continue to incur losses associated with sustained lower metals prices.Operating costs at the Company’s mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.The estimation of mineral reserves and mineralized material is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineralized material may not be realized in actual production. The Company’s results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates. The mineral reserve and mineralized material figures presented in the Company’s public filings are estimates made by the Company’s technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom the Company contracts. Mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. Mineral reserve and mineralized material estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely and have fallen significantly at times over the past several years. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead may render mineral reserves and mineralized material containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.12A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or doré as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. The Company relies on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver doré and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by the Company’s mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economical terms is critical to the Company’s ability to sell its products to buyers and generate revenues. The Company has existing agreements with refiners and smelters, some of which operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States, and the Company believes it currently has contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact the Company’s operations or its ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave the Company with limited, uneconomical or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters may also impact refiners, smelters or other third parties with whom the Company has contractual arrangements or have an indirect effect on the Company's ability to obtain refining, smelting or other third party services. In early 2020, the Coronavirus outbreak has resulted in logistical constraints throughout China, including limiting zinc and lead smelting capacity. While the Company currently has no direct contractual arrangements with Chinese smelters, the reduced smelting capacity in China has increased competition for smelting services provided in other jurisdictions. This may lead to even higher global treatment charges for lead and zinc and/or the inability of the Company to find sufficient smelting capacity for its zinc or lead production on reasonable terms or at all.Any delay or loss of access to refiners or smelters may significantly impact the Company’s ability to sell its doré and concentrate products and generate revenues. The Company cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. In November 2018, one of the refiners of the Company's dore, RMC, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. While the Company was able to divert shipments to alternative refiners following the bankruptcy filing, approximately 0.4 million ounces of the Company's silver and 6,500 ounces of the Company's gold were impacted by RMC's bankruptcy filing. In 2019, the Company entered into a partial settlement with RMC and certain other interested parties with respect to certain of its claims to this material; however, the Company did not recover the full value of the material, resulting in a write-down of the receivable balance in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.Refining charges and other fees charged by refiners and smelters may increase which may reduce the net revenues realized from production at our mines. For example, treatment charges for lead and zinc smelting have increased considerably since Coeur acquired the Silvertip mine in late 2017 due primarily to oversupply of lead and zinc, increasing costs and reducing the net proceeds from lead and zinc sales. The Silvertip mine is party to long-term lead and zinc concentrate sales agreements which provide discounts on lead and zinc treatment charges but require the Company to deliver all lead and zinc production to a single buyer until stated minimum quantities are met. Because most of the lead and all of the zinc produced by the Silvertip mine since the Company’s acquisition of Silvertip have not met minimum specifications for lead and zinc required under these long-term agreements, the Company has been exposed to market treatment charges which, in most cases, have been higher than the chargers applicable to the long-term agreements. There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or machine failure, such as the failure of the secondary crusher in Rochester’s new crushing circuit in 2019, which impacted crushing rates. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.13RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONSThe Company may be unable to successfully integrate and may not realize the expected benefits of recent or future acquisitions. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions (including the Silvertip mine and the Sterling and Lincoln Hill projects) or any future acquisition, will be realized on the originally-anticipated timeline or at all. The success and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend upon the Company’s ability to effectively manage the integration, performance and operations of entities or properties it acquires. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen challenges and may require a disproportionate amount of Company resources, which may divert focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and/or from operational matters during this process. As an example, the ramp up of the Silvertip mine, acquired in late 2017, has been slower and less profitable than originally anticipated, due primarily to more significant mill availability and maintenance challenges than were anticipated at the time Silvertip was acquired.In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in macroeconomic conditions, including commodity prices, treatment and refining charges or stock prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;•additional debt incurred or issued to fund some or all of acquisition consideration (as was the case with Silvertip and Wharf), resulting in increased interest expense and other borrowing costs;•issuance of equity securities as acquisition consideration (which occurred in the Sterling, Lincoln Hill and Silvertip project acquisitions), resulting in dilution of existing Company stockholders;•a material ore body may prove to be below expectations;•processing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment, such as the mill at Silvertip;•difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization•difficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous people; and•the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant.The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock or assure that it would be able to obtain necessary acquisition or development financing on acceptable terms or at all. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any future mine development, may negatively affect results of operations.Finally, the Company’s systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from an acquisition or development of a new mine. The Company’s future operating results could be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and integrate an acquired business or new operation into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that the Company failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with any acquisition or development. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or future prospects.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company’s ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Our plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations, including the Plan of Operations Amendment (“POA”) 11 and POA 1 (each, as defined below) planned expansions and future plans to develop the Sterling and Lincoln Hill projects. These projects can take up to several months or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks, including delays, extreme weather events, unexpected increases in the cost of required materials, and disputes with third party providers of 14materials, equipment or services, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefit, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.Mineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects, such as the Company’s La Preciosa, Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.The Company’s future growth will depend upon its ability to expand existing mines and develop and start-up new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies. Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, the Company’s ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing and expanding existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development and start-up of new mining properties, such as the Silvertip mine, the Sterling/Crown project and the Lincoln Hill and related assets.While initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. In recent years, Palmarejo completed open pit mining and developed two new underground mining operations. At Rochester, a crushing circuit using high pressure grinding roll technology was commissioned in 2019 and planning and permitting is currently underway for a significant additional expansion, including the construction of two new leach pads, two new processing facilities and crushing systems (“POA 11”).  At Kensington, the Company completed development and commenced commercial production from a new deposit in 2018 and is currently seeking to amend its operating permit to expand the operation to allow for mining activities for an additional 10 years (“POA 1”). The Company’s ability to timely complete these and future mine expansion and mine life extension projects is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are outside of the Company’s control, including, among others, availability of funding on acceptable terms and timing of receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to successfully expand existing mining operations.In addition, the Company acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Sterling/Crown project, the Lincoln Hill and related assets and the Silvertip mine. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully develop and start-up new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.The Company regularly evaluates and engages in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that the Company contemplates or pursues would involve risks and uncertainties and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.The Company may be required to write down certain of its long-lived assets, due to metal prices, operational challenges or other factors. Such write- downs may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company 15conducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed a comprehensive analysis of its Silvertip property and determined that indicators of impairment existed, primarily as a result of continued deterioration in zinc and lead market conditions as well as ongoing challenges related to the processing facility.  As a result of the impairment indicators, a recoverability test was performed and the Company concluded that the carrying value of the long-lived assets for the Silvertip property was impaired.  A non-cash impairment charge of $250.8 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019. The write-down was allocated between Property, plant and equipment, net, Mining properties, net and Other non-current assets, in the amounts of $43.6 million, $201.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively.  See Note 4 -- Impairment of Long-lived Assets and 16 -- Fair Value Measurements for additional detail of the assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the long-lived assets tested for impairment. In prior years, the Company’s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets resulted in other write-downs in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on the Company’s balance sheet. See Note 2 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.If there are further significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company may record other types of charges in the future if it sells a property or asset for a price less than it’s carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties or other assets could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company’s control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to the Company’s business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which the Company, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. As an example, as disclosed in Note 21 -- Commitments and  Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is currently engaged in efforts to recover VAT paid to the Mexican government that is owed to Coeur associated with Coeur Mexicana’s prior royalty agreement, including through ongoing litigation. The right to import and export gold, silver, zinc and lead may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, the Company’s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions, as well as epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters, can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company’s foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are not uncommon in areas in Mexico where the Company’s operations or projects are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct 16and indirect costs. The Company cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sells silver and gold doré, gold concentrate, and silver, zinc and lead concentrates in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.The Company’s success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.  The Company’s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding its operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of the Company’s properties, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding the Company’s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Like any mining company, our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock.      Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities.  No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Waste rock in the form of tailings generated as a by-product of processed ore is produced at the Kensington, Palmarejo, and Silvertip Mines. Coeur places tailings into engineered containments, underground as structural backfill, and as a dry stack material. In response to several recent tailings dam failures unrelated to Coeur that have involved loss of life and resulted in severe property and environmental ecosystem damage, Coeur completed a comprehensive review of its tailings dams and operational practices to characterize its risk profile. Coeur concluded that its tailings dams represent a low exposure risk profile for several reasons, including that our tailings dams were constructed using construction methods recognized in the industry as the most stable tailings dam design using high strength and chemically stable rock in construction.  Our dams are continuously monitored and inspected by internal resources as well as third party industry qualified experts.  The significant dam failure events that have occurred in recent years may lead to regulatory governance changes stemming from updated laws, regulation or guidance, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs if we need to make changes to existing facilities. The failure of a tailings dam or tailings storage facility at one of our mine sites could result in severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, lawsuits filed by parties who suffer injuries or property damage from such events, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineralized material and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock.The Company’s estimates of future production, costs, and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.The Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production, costs and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on these estimates and projections. Estimates and projections are made by the Company’s management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralized material, the Company’s costs of production, the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, the Company’s ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and doré and related treatment and refining charges, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. The Company sometimes states possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any production, cost, or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or 17obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made and undue reliance should not be placed on them.Forward sales, advance sales, royalty arrangements, and certain derivative instruments can result in limiting the Company’s ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices. The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it (or a mine acquired by the Company) has agreed to make advance metal sales to third parties or royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for gold or silver. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property or to achieve other business objectives. Advance metal sales,  and royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company’s ability to realize the full effects of rising metal prices and may, depending on the terms of the agreement, require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels or delivery requirements.The Company is dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration. The Company’s information technology systems used in its operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage the Company’s risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.The Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.The Company’s business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees. The Company may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.Continuation of the Company’s mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies. The Company’s mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, the Company’s properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on the Company’s ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of the Company’s operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, the Company cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company’s control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct the Company’s operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water (or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in the Company’s inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require the Company to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations 18and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which the Company operates which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting the Company’s operations.We may not be able to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assetsThe Company has accrued deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions from past operating losses, however, we may not be able to utilize part or all of these assets in the future. We only recognize the expected future tax benefit from these assets if it is considered more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be utilized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, including application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction, assumptions about future metals prices, the macroeconomic environment and results of the Company’s operations. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the Company’s ability to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets in the United States are also subject to limitation if the Company experiences a change in stock ownership in accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Management has determined that the Company experienced ownership changes, for purposes of Section 382, during 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2015. Based on management’s calculations, the Company does not expect any of its deferred tax assets to expire unused as a result of the Section 382 annual limitations. However, the annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting cash tax liabilities in a future period. RISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING The Company’s future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $295.5 million of outstanding indebtedness. The Company’s ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company’s results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments.If the Company’s cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or debt securities or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. In addition, the Facility’s (as defined below) interest rate is determined, at the Company’s option, by the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), and the Company and its lenders may not be able to agree to a new benchmark interest rate before LIBOR is expected to be eliminated by the end of 2021, which may result in higher interest costs for the Company. The agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness restrict the Company’s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict its ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. The Company may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.The terms of the Company’s debt impose restrictions on its operations.The agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:•limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;•require the Company to meet certain financial covenants consisting of a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;•require a portion of the Company’s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, which reduces the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit the Company’s ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;19•limit the Company’s flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and•place the Company at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under the Company’s other debt instruments. The Company’s inability to meet any of these covenants may also result in a lender requiring the Company to agree to additional restrictive covenants which may, among other things, limit its ability to fund its existing operations or incur additional indebtedness. The Company’s assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of its outstanding debt instruments if any of its debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to the Company or its debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to the Company or its debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If the Company is unable to maintain its outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should the Company’s business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold and silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of the Company’s outstanding debt securities, its existing debt, and its ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company’s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark- to-market fair value adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk. From time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, zinc and lead, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments. In 2019 and early 2020, the Company entered into price risk management contracts on a portion of its gold production for 2019 and 2020 after a significant increase in gold prices during 2019 and into early 2020. The Company determined to implement these contracts to provide for a minimum level of revenue from the sales of the covered gold ounces in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to fund all or a portion of the costs of several projects at existing operations.The use of derivative instruments can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.RISKS RELATED TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONSThe Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines under the British Columbia Mines Act and Relevant Sections of the Mexican Official Regulations, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines and Sterling/Crown project are frequently inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general. Similar inspections are conducted in British Columbia, Canada, at the Silvertip mine and in Mexico at the Palmarejo complex by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Mexican Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Secretary of Labor and Social Safety), respectively.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may 20require corrective measures including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company’s operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining wastes from the Company’s U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. Under the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (“MEBA”), incidental elemental mercury generated at the Company's Rochester mine as part of the processing of ore may not be exported outside of the United States and is required to be stored in a storage facility designated by the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”). Near the end of 2019, the DOE designated a facility and issued a long-term management and storage fee rule; however, the facility designation process and fee are currently subject to legal challenge by the Company and other third parties. If litigation is unsuccessful, the existing rule could result in material cost being incurred to ship and store Coeur Rochester's mercury. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company’s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, and in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota. In addition, proposed CERCLA regulations requiring mining companies to obtain supplemental financial assurance could, if adopted, have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting the Company’s current or future planned activities involving its unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.The Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. The Company’s ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations may be materially affected by third party activists.In the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects, such as the permitting efforts currently underway for POA 11 at Rochester and POA 1 at Kensington. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and 21time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company’s control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company’s expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company’s revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects the Company’s operations.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, the Company’s ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct its operations will likely depend on the Company’s ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. The Company’s ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with its activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which it operates.If future permitting applications or amendments are not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, the Company’s plans for continued operations and future growth could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.The Company operates in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, there can be no assurance that the Company’s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts or violations of laws committed by the Company’s affiliates, employees or agents. The Company is subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.The Company is currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. The Company’s inability to enforce its rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.Disputes regarding the Company’s mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company’s mining projects could adversely impact operations. The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company’s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standards, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company’s exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company’s projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. 22A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of the Company’s existing stockholders’ equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected.Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends. We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors"
0,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2019-02-20,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company’s results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond the Company’s control.Gold, silver, zinc and lead are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,178 per ounce on August 17, 2018 to a high of $1,355 per ounce on January 25, 2018, the price of silver ranged from a low of $13.97 on November 14, 2018 per ounce to a high of $17.52 per ounce on January 25, 2018, the price of zinc ranged from a low of $1.04 per pound on September 17, 2018 to a high of $1.64 per pound on February 16, 2018, and the price of lead ranged from a low of $0.85 per pound on October 31, 2018 to a high of $1.22 per pound on February 2, 2018. The closing market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead on February 19, 2019 were $1,334 per ounce, $15.78 per ounce, $1.21 per pound, and $0.91 per pound, respectively.Gold, silver, zinc and lead prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, the price of products that incorporate gold, silver, zinc or lead, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals and base metals, have become significant holders of gold, silver, zinc and lead. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation and governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles.Because the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of gold and silver and, to a lesser extent, zinc and lead from the Silvertip mine, which commenced commercial production in September 2018, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices and, to a lesser extent, zinc and lead prices, would materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if market prices for gold, silver, zinc and lead decline and remain at lower levels for a sustained period of time, the Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. The Company may be unable to decrease its costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may continue to incur losses.Operating costs at the Company’s mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.The Company may be unable to successfully integrate and may not realize the expected benefits of the recently acquired Sterling project, Lincoln Hill and related assets, Silvertip mine or other acquisitions.There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the recently completed acquisitions of the Sterling project and Lincoln Hill and related assets in Nevada, the Silvertip mine in British Columbia, Canada, or any future acquisition, will be realized. The success of these and any other acquisitions will depend upon the Company’s ability to effectively manage the integration and operations of entities or properties it acquires and to realize other anticipated benefits. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management resources, which may divert management’s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process.In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in commodity or stock prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;•a material ore body may prove to be below expectations;•processing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment;•difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; and•difficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous people13•the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant.In addition, the Silvertip acquisition was funded, in part, with funds drawn under the Company’s revolving credit facility, resulting in increased interest expense, and a portion of the consideration for the Silvertip acquisition, as well as the consideration for the acquisitions of the Sterling project and Lincoln Hill and related assets were funded through the issuance of equity securities, resulting in dilution of the percentage ownership of existing Company stockholders. In connection with any future acquisition, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, resulting in further increased interest expense or dilution. The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock, or assure that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any mine development, may negatively affect results of operations.Finally, the Company’s systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from an acquisition or development of a new mine. The Company’s future operating results could be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage the changing business conditions and to integrate an acquired business or new operation into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that the Company failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with any acquisition or development. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or future prospects.The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company’s control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to the Company’s business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which the Company, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties,  claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. The right to import and export gold, silver, zinc and lead may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, the Company’s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.These risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company’s exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations.The Company’s future growth will depend upon its ability to develop new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies.Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, the Company’s ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development of new mining properties, such as the Company’s recent Silvertip acquisition, the Sterling project and the Lincoln Hill and related assets.While initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. In addition, the Company acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Sterling project, the Lincoln Hill and related assets, the Silvertip silver-zinc-lead mine, the Wharf gold mine and the properties held by Paramount Gold & Silver Corp. which are now part of the Palmarejo complex, and has significantly expanded its near-mine exploration program. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully expand and develop existing or new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.The Company regularly evaluates and engages in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any 14transactions that the Company contemplates or pursues would involve risks and uncertainties, and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.The Company’s success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.The Company’s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding its operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of the Company’s properties, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding the Company’s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company’s foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are common in certain of the countries where the Company’s operations are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. The Company cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sells silver and gold doré, gold concentrate, and silver, zinc and lead concentrates in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.The estimation of mineral reserves and mineralized material is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineralized material may not be realized in actual production. The Company’s results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates.The mineral reserve  and mineralized material figures presented in the Company’s public filings are estimates made by the Company’s technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom the Company contracts. Mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. Mineral reserve and mineralized material estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely and have fallen significantly at times over the past several years. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead may render mineral reserves and mineralized material containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s estimates of future production, costs, and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.The Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production, costs and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Such estimates are made by the Company’s management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions, contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of 15mineralized material, the Company’s costs of production, the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, the Company’s ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and dore, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. The Company sometimes states possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any such production, cost, or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made and undue reliance should not be placed on them.The Company’s future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations.As of February 20, 2019, the Company had approximately $471.3 million of outstanding indebtedness. The Company’s ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company’s results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service debt, it may need to further refinance debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds.If the Company’s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. In addition, the Facility’s interest rate is determined, at the Company’s option, by the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), and the Company and its lenders may not be able to agree to a new benchmark interest rate before LIBOR is eliminated by the end of 2021, which may result in higher interest costs for the Company.  The agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness restrict the Company’s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict its ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. The Company may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.The terms of the Company’s debt impose restrictions on its operations.The agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:•limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;•require the Company to meet certain financial covenants consisting of a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;•require a portion of the Company’s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit the Company’s ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit the Company’s flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and•place the Company at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under the Company’s other debt instruments. 16The Company’s assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of its outstanding debt instruments if any of its debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to the Company or its debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to the Company or its debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If the Company is unable to maintain its outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should the Company’s business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold and silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of the Company’s outstanding debt securities, its existing debt, and its ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company’s business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.The Company operates in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, there can be no assurance that the Company’s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company’s affiliates, employees or agents. As such, the Company’s corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or doré as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.The Company relies on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver doré and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by the Company’s mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economical terms is critical to the Company’s ability to sell its products to buyers and generate revenues. The Company periodically enters into agreements with refiners and smelters, some of which operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States, and the Company believes it currently has contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact the Company’s operations or its ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave the Company with limited, uneconomical or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Any such delay or loss of access may significantly impact the Company’s ability to sell its doré and concentrate products. The Company cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. In November 2018, one of the refiners of the Company's dore, RMC, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Approximately 0.4 million ounces of the Company's silver and 6,500 ounces of the Company's gold were impacted by RMC's bankruptcy filing, and Coeur cannot guarantee it will be able to recover all or a portion of the value of this material. There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that the Company 17incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws (including recent changes to U.S. tax laws), possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines and Sterling Project are continuously inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company’s operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining wastes from the Company’s U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault, and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company’s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, and in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota. In addition, proposed CERCLA regulations requiring mining companies to obtain supplemental financial assurance could, if adopted, have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska 18and South Dakota. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting the Company’s current or future planned activities involving its unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.The Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. The Company’s ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists.In the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company’s control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company’s expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company’s revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects the Company’s operations.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, the Company’s ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct its operations will likely depend on the Company’s ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. The Company’s ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with its activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which it operates.If future permitting applications or amendments are not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, the Company’s plans for continued operations and future growth could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Like any mining company, our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock.      Our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities.  No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material.  Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineralized material and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock. The Company is dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.The Company’s information technology systems used in its operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage the 19Company’s risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.The Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Our plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations. These projects can take up to several months or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks, including delays, extreme weather events, unexpected increases in the cost of required materials, and disputes with third party providers of materials, equipment or services, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefit, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.  Mineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects, such as the Company’s La Preciosa project, may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.The Company’s business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees.The Company may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.The significant and sustained decline in gold and silver prices in recent years caused the Company to write down certain of its long-lived assets and, in the future, declines in relevant metal prices could cause one or more of the Company’s mining properties to become less profitable, which could require the Company to record additional write-downs of long-lived assets. Such write- downs may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.20The Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company conducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.In prior years, the Company’s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets resulted in write-downs in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on the Company’s balance sheet. See Note 4 -- Write-Downs in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.If there are further significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company may record other types of charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark- to-market fair value adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk.From time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, zinc and lead, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments.The use of derivative instruments can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.Forward sales, royalty arrangements, and certain derivative instruments can result in limiting the Company’s ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices.The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it (or a mine acquired by the Company) has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for gold or silver. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property or to achieve other business objectives. Royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company’s ability to realize the full effects of rising metal prices and may, depending on the terms of the agreement, require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels.Disputes regarding the Company’s mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company’s mining projects could adversely impact operations.The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company’s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standard, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company’s exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company’s projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, 21federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation.Continuation of the Company’s mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies.The Company’s mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, the Company’s properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on the Company’s ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of the Company’s operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, the Company cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company’s control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct the Company’s operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water (or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in the Company’s inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require the Company to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which the Company operates which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting the Company’s operations.The Company is subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.The Company is currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. The Company’s inability to enforce its rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of the Company’s existing stockholders’ equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected.Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors"
14,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2018-02-07,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company’s results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold, and, following the Silvertip acquisition, other commodities including zinc and lead, which are volatile and beyond the Company’s control.Silver, gold, zinc and lead are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the price of silver ranged from a low of  $15.22 per ounce to a high of $18.56 per ounce, the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,151 per ounce to a high of $1,346 per ounce, the price of zinc ranged from a low of $1.10 per pound to a high of $1.53 per pound, and the price of lead ranged from a low of $0.91 per pound to a high of $1.17 per pound. The closing market prices of silver, gold, zinc and lead on February 5, 2018 were $16.88 per ounce, $1,334 per ounce, $1.63 per pound, and $1.21 per pound, respectively.Silver, gold, zinc and lead prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, the price of products that incorporate silver, gold, zinc or lead, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals and base metals, have become significant holders of gold, silver, zinc and lead. Silver and gold prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation and governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles.Because the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of silver and gold and, to a lesser extent, zinc and lead as a result of the Silvertip acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2017, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices and, to a lesser extent, zinc and lead prices, would materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if market prices for silver, gold, zinc and lead decline and remain at lower levels for a sustained period of time, the Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. The Company may be unable to decrease its costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may continue to incur losses.Operating costs at the Company’s mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s future growth will depend upon its ability to develop new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies.Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, the Company’s ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development of new mining properties, such as the Company’s recent Silvertip acquisition.While initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure.  In addition, the Company has acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Silvertip silver-zinc-lead mine, the Wharf gold mine and the properties held by Paramount Gold & Silver Corp. which are now part of the Palmarejo complex, and has significantly expanded its near-mine exploration program. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully expand and develop existing or new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.The Company regularly evaluates and engages in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that the Company contemplates or pursues would involve risks and uncertainties.  There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.13The Company may be unable to successfully integrate the recently acquired Silvertip mine or other acquisitions.There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the recently completed acquisition of the Silvertip mine in British Columbia, Canada, or any future acquisition, will be realized. The success of this and any other acquisition will depend upon the Company’s ability to effectively manage the integration and operations of entities or properties it acquires and to realize other anticipated benefits. The process of managing acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management resources, which may divert management’s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process.In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in commodity or stock prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; •a material ore body may prove to be below expectations; •difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; and •the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. In addition, the Silvertip acquisition was funded, in part, with funds drawn under the Company’s revolving credit facility, resulting in increased interest expense. In connection with any future acquisition, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing stockholders. The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock, or assure that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any mine development, may negatively affect results of operations.Finally, the Company’s systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from an acquisition or development of a new mine. The Company’s future operating results could be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage the changing business conditions and to integrate an acquired business or new operation into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that the Company failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with any acquisition or development. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or future prospects.The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company’s control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to the Company’s business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which the Company, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. The right to import and export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, the Company’s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.These risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company’s exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations.14The Company’s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of the Company’s properties, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding the Company’s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company’s foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security.  These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are common in certain of the countries where the Company’s operations are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. The Company cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sells silver and gold doré, gold concentrate, and expects to sell its silver, zinc and lead concentrates in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. The Company’s results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates.The ore reserve figures presented in the Company’s public filings are estimates made by the Company’s technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom the Company contracts. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and silver, gold, zinc and lead market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver, gold, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely and have fallen significantly at times over the past several years. Declines in the market prices of silver, gold, zinc or lead may render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its reserve estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s estimates of future production, costs, and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.The Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production, costs and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. Such estimates are made by the Company’s management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions, contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralized material, the Company’s costs of production, the market prices of silver, gold, zinc and lead, the Company’s ability to sustain and increase production levels, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. The Company sometimes states possible outcomes as high and low ranges which 15are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any such production, cost, or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made and undue reliance should not be placed on them.The Company’s future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations.As of February 5, 2018, the Company had approximately $411.3 million of outstanding indebtedness. The Company’s ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company’s results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of silver, gold, zinc and lead. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service debt, it may need to further refinance debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds.If the Company’s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. The agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness restrict the Company’s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict its ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. The Company may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.The terms of the Company’s debt impose restrictions on its operations.The agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:•limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;•require the Company to meet certain financial covenants consisting of a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;•require a portion of the Company’s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit the Company’s ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;•increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;•limit the Company’s flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and•place the Company at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under the Company’s other debt instruments. The Company’s assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of its outstanding debt instruments if any of its debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.16Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to the Company or its debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to the Company or its debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If the Company is unable to maintain its outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should the Company’s business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in silver and gold prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of the Company’s outstanding debt securities, its existing debt, and its ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company’s business is subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.The Company operates in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, there can be no assurance that the Company’s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company’s affiliates, employees or agents. As such, the Company’s corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by smelters could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.The Company currently sells its gold concentrates from the Kensington mine to one third-party smelter in China. The loss of this smelter could have a material adverse effect on the Company if alternative smelters are unavailable. The Company cannot ensure that alternative smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws (including recent changes to U.S. tax laws), possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.17U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines are continuously inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. In addition, any of the Company’s U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shutdown as a result of a violation alleged by MSHA. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company’s operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining wastes from the Company’s U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault, and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company’s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, and in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota. In addition, proposed CERCLA regulations requiring mining companies to obtain supplemental financial assurance could, if adopted, have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.18In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting the Company’s current or future planned activities involving its unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.The Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. The Company’s ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists.In the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company’s control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company’s expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company’s revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects the Company’s operations.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, the Company’s ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct its operations will likely depend on the Company’s ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. The Company’s ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with its activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which it operates.If future permitting applications or amendments are not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, the Company’s plans for continued operations and future growth could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits.  Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects, such as the Company’s La Preciosa project, may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery 19rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.The significant and sustained decline in gold and silver prices in recent years caused the Company to write down certain of its long-lived assets and, in the future, declines in relevant metal prices could cause one or more of the Company’s mining properties to become less profitable, which could require the Company to record additional write-downs of long-lived assets. Such write-downs may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company conducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.In prior years, the Company’s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets resulted in write-downs in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on the Company’s balance sheet. See Note 4 -- Write-Downs in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.    If there are further significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company may record other types of charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market fair value adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk.From time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of silver, gold, zinc and lead, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments.The use of derivative instruments can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.Forward sales, royalty arrangements, and certain derivative instruments can result in limiting the Company’s ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices.The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it (or a mine acquired by the Company) has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for silver or gold. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property or to achieve other business objectives. Royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company’s ability to realize the full effects of rising gold or silver prices and may require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels.20The Company is dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.The Company’s information technology systems used in its operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design.  Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data.  Various measures have been implemented to manage the Company’s risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.The Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations.  Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.The Company’s business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees.The Company may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. During the past several years, two of the Company’s mines have experienced work stoppages, each of which was resolved within a short period of time and had no material effect on results of operations or financial condition. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.At December 31, 2017, unions represented approximately 7% of the Company’s global workforce, all of which were comprised of workers at the San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia. Manquiri has a labor agreement at the San Bartolomé mine which is in effect for 2018. The Company cannot predict whether this agreement will be renewed on similar terms or at all, whether future labor disruptions will occur or, if disruptions do occur, how long they will last.We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.Disputes regarding the Company’s mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company’s mining projects could adversely impact operations.The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company’s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standard, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company’s exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company’s projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation. 21Continuation of the Company’s mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies.The Company’s mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, the Company’s properties in Mexico are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on the Company’s ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of the Company’s operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, the Company cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company’s control, such as the drought conditions in Bolivia that have significantly negatively impacted 2017 operations at the San Bartolomé mine. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct the Company’s operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water (or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in the Company’s inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require the Company to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which the Company operates which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting the Company’s operations.The Company is subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.The Company is currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. The Company’s inability to enforce its rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of the Company’s existing stockholders’ equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected.Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends.We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors.The Company’s operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks.Until the Manquiri Divestiture closes, the Company remains subject to political risks associated with operating in Bolivia. In response to conflicts between local mining cooperatives and the Bolivian government, on September 1, 2016, the Bolivian 22government issued Supreme Decree No. 2891, and on October 24, 2016, Law 845, which impose tighter restrictions on mining cooperatives, including reversion of mining areas leased to the mining cooperatives by COMIBOL that are subject to joint venture agreements, leases or subleases with third parties to the Bolivian state. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Manquiri is currently party to various JV Agreements with local cooperatives and has also entered in to mining contracts directly with COMIBOL (which are not impacted by the decree). Although Bolivian government officials have made public statements that the decree will not impact Manquiri’s ability to continue operations in the areas subject to the JV Agreements and the JV Agreements continue to be formally in existence, any cancellation of leases between COMIBOL and the applicable mining cooperatives and/or the JV Agreements will require negotiation of and entry into contracts directly with COMIBOL to continue mining operations at the affected areas, which could have an adverse impact on financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, an interim permit was granted to Manquiri allowing for continuation of mining operations in the areas subject to the JV Agreements pending negotiation of contracts directly with COMIBOL.In addition, the potential effects of the Bolivian mining law enacted in 2014 remain uncertain until the regulations implementing the law are accompanied by a new contractual structure. The law regulates royalties and provides for mining contracts with the government rather than concession holding. The regulations promulgated under the new mining law may mandate a renegotiation of the terms of Manquiri’s existing contracts with COMIBOL, this could materially adversely affect the profitability and cash flow of Manquiri’s operations in Bolivia.In addition, companies in Bolivia are also operating under Law No. 403 of September 18, 2013, and its regulatory Supreme Decree, which provides for the reversion of mining rights if the Ministry of Mines verifies that a person with mining rights has not initiated mining activities or developed the mining rights. The contracts with COMIBOL and the cooperatives are excluded from the application of Law No. 403. In April 2014, Manquiri was served by the Bolivian government with a reversion decision affecting nine mining rights wholly-owned by Manquiri. The affected area is not in an area of active mining by Manquiri and the Manquiri’s San Bartolomé operations were not targeted as an area of interest in the decision since all of our past and current mining activity is performed through our contracts with COMIBOL and the mining cooperatives.It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia"
3,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2017-02-09,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company's results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold and other commodities, which are volatile and beyond the Company's control.Silver and gold are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the price of silver ranged from a low of  $13.58 per ounce to a high of $20.71 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,077 per ounce to a high of $1,366 per ounce.  The closing market prices of silver and gold on February 7, 2017 were $17.60 per ounce and $1,231 per ounce, respectively. Silver and gold prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, global currency values, governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in the prices of silver and gold include a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net outflows from gold and silver ETFs, bullion sales by private and government holders and global economic conditions and/or fiscal policies that negatively impact large consumer markets.Because the Company derives all of its revenues from sales of silver and gold, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change.  A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if market prices for silver and gold decline further or remain at current or lower levels for a sustained period of time, the Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. The Company may be unable to decrease its costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may continue to incur losses.Operating costs at the Company’s mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s future growth will depend upon its ability to develop new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies.Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, the Company’s ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development of new mining properties.While initial development of major mining properties at Palmarejo, San Bartolomé, Rochester, and Kensington has been substantially completed, development work continues at Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. The Company is currently in the process of developing the Guadalupe and Independencia deposits at the Palmarejo complex and the Jualin deposit at Kensington and has commenced a project to expand leach pad capacity at Rochester.  In addition, the Company has acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the La Preciosa silver-gold exploration project in the state of Durango, Mexico, the Wharf gold mine and the properties held by Paramount, and has expanded its near-mine exploration program. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully develop existing or new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.The Company regularly evaluates and engages in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that the Company contemplates or pursues would involve risks and uncertainties.  There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. The success of any acquisition will depend upon the Company’s ability to effectively manage the integration and operations of entities or properties it acquires and to realize other anticipated benefits. The process of managing acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management resources, which may divert management’s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process.12In addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in commodity or stock prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; •a material ore body may prove to be below expectations; •difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; and •the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. In connection with an acquisition or development of an existing property, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing stockholders. The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock, or assure that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any mine development, may negatively affect results of operations.Finally, the Company’s systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from an acquisition or development of a new mine. The Company’s future operating results could be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage the changing business conditions and to integrate an acquired business or new operation into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that the Company failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with any acquisition or development. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or future prospects.The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operationsA significant portion of the Company’s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company’s control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to the Company's business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which the Company, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. The right to import and export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, the Company’s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.    Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.These risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company’s exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations.The Company’s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities, including indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding the Company’s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.13The Company’s operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks.In response to conflicts between local mining cooperatives and the Bolivian government, on September 1, 2016, the Bolivian government issued Supreme Decree No. 2891, and on October 24, 2016, Law 845, which impose tighter restrictions on mining cooperatives, including reversion of mining areas leased to the mining cooperatives by COMIBOL that are subject to joint venture agreements, leases or subleases with third parties to the Bolivian state. The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Manquiri is currently party to various JV Agreements with local cooperatives and has also entered in to mining contracts directly with COMIBOL (which are not impacted by the decree). Although Bolivian government officials have made public statements that the decree will not impact Manquiri’s ability to continue operations in the areas subject to the JV Agreements and the JV Agreements continue to be formally in existence, any cancellation of leases between COMIBOL and the applicable mining cooperatives and/or the JV Agreements will require negotiation of and entry into contracts directly with COMIBOL to continue mining operations at the affected areas, which could have an adverse impact on financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In January 2017, an interim permit was granted to Manquiri allowing for continuation of mining operations in the areas subject to the JV Agreements pending negotiation of contracts directly with COMIBOL.The Company has also been assessing the potential effects of the Bolivian mining law enacted in 2014 on its Bolivian operations but any effects remain uncertain until the regulations implementing the law are accompanied by a new contractual structure. The law regulates royalties and provides for mining contracts with the government rather than concession holding. If the regulations promulgated under the new mining law mandate a renegotiation of the terms of our existing contracts with COMIBOL, this could materially adversely affect the profitability and cash flow of our operations in Bolivia.In addition, companies in Bolivia are also operating under Law No. 403 of September 18, 2013, and its regulatory Supreme Decree, which provides for the reversion of mining rights if the Ministry of Mines verifies that a person with mining rights has not initiated mining activities or developed the mining rights. The contracts with COMIBOL and the cooperatives are excluded from the application of Law No. 403. In April 2014, Manquiri was served by the Bolivian government with a reversion decision affecting nine mining rights wholly-owned by Manquiri. The affected area is not in an area of active mining by Manquiri and the Manquiri’s San Bartolomé operations were not targeted as an area of interest in the decision since all of our past and current mining activity is performed through our contracts with COMIBOL and the mining cooperatives.It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company’s foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security.  These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are common in certain of the countries where the Company’s operations are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. The Company cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company sells silver and gold doré and concentrates in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.14The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. The Company’s results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates.The ore reserve figures presented in the Company’s public filings are estimates made by the Company’s technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom the Company contracts. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely and have fallen significantly at times over the past several years. Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its reserve estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s estimates of future production, costs, and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.The Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production, costs and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Such estimates are made by the Company’s management and technical personnel and depend on numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of ore, the Company’s costs of production, the market prices of silver and gold, the Company’s ability to sustain and increase production levels, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any such production, cost, or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.The Company’s future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations.As of February 7, 2017, the Company had approximately $210.9 million of outstanding indebtedness. The Company’s ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company’s results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of silver and gold. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service debt, it may need to further refinance debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds.The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.15The terms of the Company’s debt impose restrictions on its operations.The agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:•limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;•require a portion of the Company’s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; and•place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted debt the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under the Company’s other debt instruments. The Company’s assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of its outstanding debt instruments if any of its debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to the Company or its debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to the Company or its debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If the Company is unable to maintain its outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should the Company’s business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in silver and gold prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of the Company’s outstanding debt securities, its existing debt, and its ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company’s business is subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.The Company operates in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, there can be no assurance that the Company’s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company’s affiliates, employees or agents. As such, the Company’s corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Continuation of the Company’s mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies.The Company’s mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, the Company’s properties in Mexico are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on the Company’s ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of the Company’s operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, the Company cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company’s control, such as the current drought conditions in Bolivia that have impacted operations at our San Bartolomé mine. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct the Company's operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water 16(or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in the Company’s inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require the Company to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which the Company operates which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting the Company’s operations.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by smelters could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.The Company currently sells its gold concentrates from the Kensington mine to a third-party smelter in China. The loss of this smelter could have a material adverse effect on the Company if alternative smelters are unavailable. The Company cannot ensure that alternative smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines are continuously inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. In addition, any of the Company’s U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shutdown as a result of a violation alleged by MSHA. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental 17problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company’s operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining wastes from the Company’s U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the RCRA. If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under CERCLA. Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault, and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company’s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, and in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota. In addition, proposed CERCLA regulations requiring mining companies to obtain supplemental financial assurance could, if adopted, have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals related to climate change, including legislation pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting the Company’s current or future planned activities involving its unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.The Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. The Company’s ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists.In the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company's control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company's expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company's revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects the Company’s operations.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, the Company’s ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct its operations will likely depend on the Company’s ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. The Company’s ability to obtain 18permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with its activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which it operates.In June 2013, Coeur submitted a proposed amendment to the plan of operations for the Rochester mine (“POA 10”) to the BLM to expand leach pad capacity. The record of decision from the BLM for POA 10 was received three years later, in June 2016. If future permitting applications or amendments are not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, the Company’s plans for continued operations and future growth could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits.  Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects, such as the Company’s La Preciosa project, may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.The significant and sustained decline in gold and silver prices from 2013 to early 2016 caused the Company to write down certain of its long-lived assets and, in the future, such declines could cause one or more of the Company’s mining properties to become less profitable, which could require the Company to record additional write-downs of long-lived assets. Such write-downs may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company conducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.The Company’s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets in 2016 indicated that a write-down of $4.4 million was required.  These non-cash impairment charges resulted in write-downs in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2016. See Note 4 -- Write-Downs in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.    If there are further significant and sustained declines in silver and gold prices or if the currently low silver or gold prices remain at such prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its 19mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company may record other types of charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market fair value adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk.From time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of silver and gold, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments.The use of derivative instruments can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.Forward sales, royalty arrangements, and certain derivative instruments can result in limiting the Company’s ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices.The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for silver or gold. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property or to achieve other business objectives. Royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company’s ability to realize the full effects of rising gold or silver prices and may require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels.The Company is dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.The Company’s information technology systems used in its operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design.  Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data.  Various measures have been implemented to manage the Company’s risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.The Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations.  Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.The Company’s business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees.The Company may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. During the past several years, two of the Company’s mines have experienced work stoppages, each of which was resolved within a short period of time and had no material effect on results of operations or financial condition. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.20At December 31, 2016, unions represented approximately 11% of the Company’s global workforce, all of which were comprised of workers at the San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia. The Company has a labor agreement at the San Bartolomé mine which is in effect for 2017. The Company cannot predict whether this agreement will be renewed on similar terms or at all, whether future labor disruptions will occur or, if disruptions do occur, how long they will last.We compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.Disputes regarding the Company’s mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company’s mining projects could adversely impact operations.The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company’s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standard, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company’s exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company’s projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation. In Bolivia, in the past we have obtained surface rights from cooperatives, through a series of “joint venture” contracts. Changes to or termination of the existing agreements or leases or failure to reach agreement in any future negotiations with the cooperatives or the Bolivian government may have a significant impact on operations at the Company’s projects and may, on occasion, lead to litigation. Further, the Bolivian government under Law No. 403 may have the ability to reverse our wholly-owned mining rights. Any such reversion decision could adversely impact our future mining plans.The Company relies on third parties who own, maintain and operate the mines underlying its streaming and royalty assets.The Endeavor mine is owned, maintained and operated by Cobar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH. However, pursuant to a silver sale and purchase agreement, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd. (“CDE Australia”), has acquired all silver production and reserves at the Endeavor mine, up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces. CDE Australia has agreed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver, indexed annually for inflation, plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $7.00 per ounce.  In addition, the Company currently holds a 1.5% NSR on Dynasty Metals & Mining, Inc.’s Zaruma mine in Ecuador as well as several royalties on mining assets that are not yet developed.  The Company may acquire additional streaming and royalty interests in the future.The Company relies on third parties to own, maintain and operate the mining projects underlying its royalty and streaming interests, which exposes it to substantial counterparty risk. These third parties may fail to adequately or appropriately operate or maintain their respective projects or may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with the Company.The Company cannot ensure that each of these third parties will not suffer financial hardship, will continue as a going concern or will not enter bankruptcy or otherwise liquidate. Any such event could expose the Company to significant costs and could limit the amounts, if any, the Company could recover in any proceeding against any such third party for breach of their agreement with the Company. There can be no assurance that the production from any of these mining operations will meet forecasted production targets. At any time, any of the owners or operators of these mining operations may decide to suspend or discontinue operations. In addition, the owners or operators of projects that are not yet operational in which the Company may hold royalty or streaming interests may decide to delay or not to proceed with commencing commercial production. Any failure, 21inability or refusal of a counterparty to meet its obligations to the Company under these royalty or streaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.The Company is subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.The Company is currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. The Company’s inability to enforce its rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of the Company's existing stockholders' equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected.Holders of our common stock may not receive dividends. We have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors"
6,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2016-02-10,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company's results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold and other commodities, which are volatile and beyond the Company's control.  Silver and gold are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the price of silver ranged from a low of $13.71 per ounce to a high of $18.23 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,049 per ounce to a high of $1,296 per ounce.  The closing market prices of silver and gold on February 9, 2016 were $15.34 per ounce and $1,191 per ounce, respectively. Silver and gold prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, global currency values, governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in the prices of silver and gold include a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net outflows from gold and silver ETFs, bullion sales by private and government holders and global economic conditions and/or fiscal policies that negatively impact large consumer markets.Because the Company derives all of its revenues from sales of silver and gold, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change.  A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if market prices for silver and gold decline further or remain at current or lower levels for a sustained period of time, the Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. The Company may be unable to decrease its costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may continue to incur losses.Operating costs at the Company’s mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.The significant and sustained decline in gold and silver prices since 2013 caused the Company to write down certain of its long-lived assets and, in the future, such declines could cause one or more of the Company’s mining properties to become less profitable, which could require the Company to record additional write-downs of long-lived assets. Such write-downs may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360 (“ASC 360”). Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company conducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.The Company’s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 under ASC 360 indicated that write-downs of its long-lived assets of $313.3 million and $1,472.7 million, respectively, were required.  These non-cash impairment charges resulted in write-downs in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2015 and 2014. See Note 4 -- Write-Downs in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.    If there are further significant and sustained declines in silver and gold prices or if the currently low silver or gold prices remain at such prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.11The Company may record other types of charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s future growth will depend upon its ability to develop new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition from other mining companies.Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, an important element of the Company’s business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines, properties and businesses or interests therein. The Company’s ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing existing properties and developing or acquiring new mining properties.  While initial development of major mining properties at Palmarejo, San Bartolomé, Rochester, and Kensington has been substantially completed, development work continues at Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington to expand these mines while using existing infrastructure.  Since December 2012, the Company has owned 100% of the Joaquin silver-gold exploration project located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. As a result of its acquisition of Orko (now Coeur La Preciosa Silver Corp.) in April 2013, the Company also holds the La Preciosa silver-gold exploration project in the state of Durango, Mexico. The Company acquired the Wharf gold mine in February 2015 and Paramount in April 2015. The Company is also currently in the process of developing the Guadalupe and Independencia deposits at the Palmarejo complex and the Jualin deposit at Kensington. These strategies are inherently risky, and the Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully develop existing or new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.The Company expects to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and pursue those opportunities it believes are in the Company’s long-term best interests. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any such acquisition will be realized. The success of any acquisition will depend upon the Company’s ability to effectively manage the integration and operations of entities or properties it acquires and to realize other anticipated benefits. The process of managing acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management resources, which may divert management’s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process.Any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in commodity or stock prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; •a material ore body may prove to be below expectations; •difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; and •the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. In connection with an acquisition, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing stockholders. The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock, or assure that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may negatively affect results of operations.In addition, the Company’s systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from an acquisition. The Company’s future operating results could be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage the changing business conditions and to integrate the acquired business into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that the Company failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with an acquisition. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or future prospects.The Company’s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market fair value adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk.From time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of silver and gold, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments.12The use of derivative instruments can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks in the countries in which it has significant operations or interests.A significant portion of the Company’s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States, and it is subject to significant risks inherent in mineral extraction by foreign companies and contracts with government owned entities. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company’s control. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases, risks associated with the value-added tax (“VAT”) recovery and collection process, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted. The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company’s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.These risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company’s exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations.The Company’s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities, including indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations.  Notwithstanding the Company’s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company’s foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security.  These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.In addition, acts of civil disobedience are common in certain of the countries where the Company’s operations are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct and indirect costs. The Company cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. The Company sells silver and gold doré and concentrates in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.13The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. The Company’s results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates.The ore reserve figures presented in the Company’s public filings are estimates made by the Company’s technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom the Company contracts. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely and have continued to fall over the past several years. Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its reserve estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s estimates of future production, costs, and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors and may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.The Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production, costs and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Such estimates are made by the Company’s management and technical personnel and depend on numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of ore, the Company’s costs of production, the market prices of silver and gold, the Company’s ability to sustain and increase production levels, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any such production, cost, or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Forward sales, royalty arrangements, and certain derivative instruments can result in limiting the Company’s ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices.The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for silver or gold. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property or to achieve other business objectives. Royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company’s ability to realize the full effects of rising gold or silver prices and may require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels. The Company’s future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations.As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $490.4 million of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, the Company's total debt excludes $15.2 million for future minimum estimated gold production royalty payments due from Coeur Mexicana to Franco-Nevada. The liabilities associated with these gold production royalty payments increase as the price of gold increases. The Company’s ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company’s results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of silver and gold. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service debt, it may need to further refinance debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds.The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase.14The terms of the Company’s debt impose restrictions on its operations. The agreements governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:•limit the Company’s ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding debt or equity or issue debt or equity securities;•require a substantial portion of the Company’s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and•place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted debt the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under the Company’s other debt instruments. The Company’s assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of its outstanding debt instruments if any of its debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation. The Company might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to meet capital needs, conduct business, make payments when due or refinance debt.The Company might need to raise additional funds in order to meet capital needs, implement its business plan, refinance debt or acquire complementary assets. Any required additional financing might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to the Company’s debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to the Company will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If the Company is unable to maintain its outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should the Company’s business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in silver and gold prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of the Company’s outstanding debt securities, its existing debt, and its ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company’s existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company’s business is subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.The Company operates in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. There can be no assurance that the Company’s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company’s affiliates, employees or agents. As such, the Company’s corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.15Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration, development and mining activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits.  Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by smelter customers could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.The Company currently sells gold concentrates to third-party smelters in China, Japan, and Australia. The loss of any one smelter could have a material adverse effect on the Company if alternative smelters were unavailable. The Company cannot ensure that alternative smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.16U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines are continuously inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. In addition, any of the Company’s U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shutdown as a result of a violation alleged by MSHA. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company’s operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining wastes from the Company’s U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the RCRA. If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under CERCLA. Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault, and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company’s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, and in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals related to climate change, including legislation pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.17Continuation of the Company’s mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies.The Company’s mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, the Company’s properties in Mexico are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on the Company’s ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of the Company’s operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, the Company cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company’s control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct the Company's operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water could require the Company to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which the Company operates which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting the Company’s operations.The Company relies on third parties who own, maintain and operate the mines underlying its streaming and royalty assets.The Endeavor mine is owned, maintained and operated by Cobar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH. However, pursuant to a silver sale and purchase agreement, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd. (“CDE Australia”), has acquired all silver production and reserves at the Endeavor mine, up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces. CDE Australia has agreed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver, indexed annually for inflation, plus a further increment when the silver price exceeds $7.00 per ounce.  In addition, the Company currently holds a tiered royalty on McEwen Mining Inc.’s El Gallo complex in Mexico, currently paying a 3.5% NSR, a 1.5% NSR on Dynasty Metals & Mining, Inc.’s Zaruma mine in Ecuador, a 2.0% NSR on Mandalay Resources Corp.’s Cerro Bayo mine in Chile, and an 80% interest in a 2.5% royalty on OceanaGold Corporation's Correnso mine in New Zealand, as well as several royalties on mining assets that are not yet developed.  The Company may acquire additional streaming and royalty interests in the future.The Company relies on third parties to own, maintain and operate the mining projects underlying its royalty and streaming interests, which exposes it to substantial counterparty risk. These third parties may fail to adequately or appropriately operate or maintain their respective projects or may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with the Company.The Company cannot ensure that each of these third parties will not suffer financial hardship, will continue as a going concern or will not enter bankruptcy or otherwise liquidate. Any such event could expose the Company to significant costs and could limit the amounts, if any, the Company could recover in any proceeding against any such third party for breach of their agreement with the Company. There can be no assurance that the production from any of these mining operations will meet forecasted production targets. At any time, any of the owners or operators of these mining operations may decide to suspend or discontinue operations. In addition, the owners or operators of projects that are not yet operational in which the Company may hold royalty or streaming interests may decide to delay or not to proceed with commencing commercial production. Any failure, inability or refusal of a counterparty to meet its obligations to the Company under these royalty or streaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.The Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. The Company’s ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists.In the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company's control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company's expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company's revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects the Company’s operations.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental 18permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, the Company’s ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct its operations will likely depend on the Company’s ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. The Company’s ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with its activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which it operates.In June 2013, Coeur submitted a proposed amendment to the plan of operations for the Rochester mine (“POA 10”) to the BLM to expand leach pad capacity. Absent POA 10 approval, Coeur anticipates that the capacity under the existing leach pad will be insufficient after mid to late 2017. If POA 10 is not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, the Company’s plans for continued operations and future growth at Rochester could be materially adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company is dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration. The Company’s information technology systems used in its operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and defects in design.  Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data.  Various measures have been implemented to manage the Company’s risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.The Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations.  Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.The Company’s exploration projects, La Preciosa and Joaquin, are subject to significant development, operational and regulatory risks.As exploration projects, La Preciosa and Joaquin are subject to numerous risks. The economic feasibility of an exploration project is based on many factors such as: estimation of mineral reserves and mineralized material, anticipated metallurgical recoveries, environmental considerations and permitting, future metals prices, and anticipated capital and operating costs of these projects. For the La Preciosa project, the Company’s 2014 feasibility study derived estimates of costs and economic returns based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of reserves to be mined and processed, the configuration of the mineral body, expected recovery rates, estimated expenditures, anticipated climatic conditions and other factors. As a result, it is possible that actual costs and economic returns will differ significantly from those estimated for the project in the feasibility study.  For example, the significant decline in metals prices since the feasibility study, among other factors, has resulted in the reclassification of the mineral reserves previously declared at La Preciosa.  When the Company ultimately determines to proceed with project construction, the Company may be unable to complete project and environmental permitting within an economically acceptable time frame.As a result of these and related risks, future estimates of or actual costs and economic returns of the La Preciosa and Joaquin projects may materially differ from the estimated costs and returns for these projects. The Company’s operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks.In May 2014, the new Bolivian mining law was enacted. The Company has been assessing the potential effects of the legislation on its Bolivian operations but any effects remain uncertain until the regulations implementing the law are enacted. The law regulates royalties and provides for mining contracts with the government rather than concession holding.  If the regulations promulgated under the new mining law mandate a renegotiation of the terms of our existing contracts with the Bolivian state-19owned mining company, Corporacion Minera de Bolivia (“COMIBOL”) and the mining cooperatives, this could materially adversely affect the profitability and cash flow of our operations in Bolivia. It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may further affect mining in Bolivia.In addition, companies are also operating under Law No. 403 of September 18, 2013, and its regulatory Supreme Decree, which provides for the reversion of mining rights if the Ministry of Mines verifies that a person with mining rights has not initiated mining activities or developed the mining rights. The contracts with COMIBOL and the cooperatives are excluded from the application of Law No. 403. In April 2014, our subsidiary in Bolivia was served by the Bolivian government with a reversion decision affecting nine mining rights wholly-owned by our subsidiary. The affected area is not in an area of active mining by the Company and the Company’s San Bartolomé operations were not targeted as an area of interest in the decision since all of our past and current mining activity is performed through our contracts with COMIBOL and the mining cooperatives.On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken.  The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts with COMIBOL as well as under authorized contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights under contract themselves with COMIBOL.  The stability studies have been completed and officially submitted to the Bolivian mining technical authorities.  Accordingly, the COMIBOL suspension has expired in accordance with the terms of the resolution.  As a result of the resolution, the Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The Cooperative Reserva Fiscal, with whom the Company has one of those contracts, subsequently interpreted the COMIBOL resolution and determined that the Huacajchi deposit was not covered by such resolution. In March 2010, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal notified COMIBOL that, based on its interpretation, it was resuming mining of high grade material above the 4,400 meter level in the Huacajchi deposit. In December 2011, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal sent a similar notification to COMIBOL with respect to a further area above the 4,400 meter level known as Huacajchi Sur.  Based on these notifications and on the absence of any objection from COMIBOL, the Company resumed limited mining operations at the San Bartolomé mine on the Huacajchi deposit and Huacajchi Sur.   Despite the fact that the COMIBOL suspension has expired, the Company has not resumed mining in other areas above the 4,400 meter level due to community relations concerns and the current political climate in Bolivia.While the COMIBOL suspension has expired, it is uncertain at this time how long the Company will continue to suspend its mining operations in areas above the 4,400 meter level other than at Huacajchi and Huacajchi Sur.  If COMIBOL decides to affirmatively adopt a new resolution to restrict access above the 4,400 meter level on a permanent basis, the Company may need to further write down the carrying value of the asset.  While a portion of the Company's proven and probable reserves relate to material above the 4,400 meter level at San Bartolomé, so long as operations remain suspended, there is a risk that silver may not be produced from this material at expected levels or at all, particularly given the remaining anticipated mine life of this asset.  It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.The Company’s business depends on good relations with its employees.The Company may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. During the past three years, two of the Company’s mines have experienced work stoppages, each of which was resolved within a short period of time and had no material effect on results of operations or financial condition. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.At December 31, 2015, unions represented approximately 11% of the Company’s global workforce, all of which were comprised of workers at the San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia. The Company has a labor agreement at the San Bartolomé mine which is in effect for 2016. The Company cannot predict whether this agreement will be renewed on similar terms or at all, whether future labor disruptions will occur or, if disruptions do occur, how long they will last.Disputes regarding the Company’s mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company’s mining projects or conservation efforts involving U.S. federal lands could adversely impact operations.The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company’s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standard, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or 20rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company’s exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company’s projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation. In Bolivia, we obtain surface rights from cooperatives, through a series of “joint venture” contracts. Changes to the existing agreements or leases or failure to reach agreement in any negotiations may have a significant impact on operations at the Company’s projects and may, on occasion, lead to litigation. Further, the Bolivian government under Law No. 403 may have the ability to reverse our wholly-owned mining rights. Any such reversion decision could adversely impact our future mining plans.In addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting the Company’s current or future planned activities involving its unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.The Company is subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.The Company is currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. The Company’s inability to enforce its rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of the Company's existing stockholders' equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected"
16,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2015-02-20,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company's results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold and other commodities, which are volatile and beyond the Company's control. The Company's use of derivative contracts to protect against such volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market accounting adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk. Silver and gold are exchange-traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, the price of silver ranged from a low of $15.28 per ounce to a high of $22.05 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,142 per ounce to a high of $1,385 per ounce. The closing market prices of silver and gold on February 19, 2015 were $16.73 per ounce and $1,208 per ounce, respectively. Silver and gold prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company’s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, global currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in the prices of silver and gold include a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net outflows from gold and silver ETFs, bullion sales by private and government holders and global economic conditions and/or fiscal policies that negatively impact large consumer markets.Because the Company derives all of its revenues from sales of silver and gold, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals increase or decrease. A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect the results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if market prices for silver and gold decline or remain at relatively low levels for a sustained period of time, the Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. The Company may be unable to decrease its costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may incur losses.Operating costs at the Company’s mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.The significant and sustained decline in gold and silver prices during 2013 and 2014 caused the Company to write down certain of its long-lived assets and, in the future, such declines could cause one or more of the Company’s mining properties to become less profitable, which could require the Company to record additional write-downs of long-lived assets. Such write-downs may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360 (“ASC 360”). Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company conducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.10The Company’s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets at December 31, 2014 and 2013 under ASC 360 indicated that write-downs of its long-lived assets of $1,472.7 million and $773.0 million, respectively, were required. These non-cash impairment charges resulted in write-downs in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2014 and 2013. See Note 4 -- Write-Downs in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.    If there are further significant and sustained declines in silver and gold prices or if the currently low silver or gold prices remain at such prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company may record other types of additional mining property charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s future growth will depend upon its ability to develop new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition from other mining companies.Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, an important element of the Company’s business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines, properties and businesses or interests therein. The Company’s ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing existing properties and developing or acquiring new mining properties. During 2011, the Company successfully constructed a new leach pad at the Company’s Rochester mine. Development of other major mining properties at Palmarejo, San Bartolomé and Kensington has been substantially completed.  Since December 2012, the Company has owned 100% of the Joaquin silver-gold exploration project located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina. As a result of its acquisition of Orko (now Coeur La Preciosa Silver Corp.) in April 2013, the Company also holds the La Preciosa silver-gold exploration project in the state of Durango, Mexico. In addition, the Company announced in December 2014 the acquisition of Paramount and in January 2015 the acquisition of the Wharf gold mine, both of which are expected to close in the first half of 2015. These strategies are inherently risky, and the Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully develop existing or new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.The Company may be unable to complete and successfully integrate an announced acquisition, including the recently announced Paramount and Wharf gold mine acquisitions.The Company expects to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and pursue those opportunities it believes are in the Company’s long-term best interests. There can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of any such acquisition will be realized. The success of any acquisition will depend upon the Company’s ability to effectively manage the integration and operations of entities or properties it acquires and to realize other anticipated benefits. The process of managing acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management resources, which may divert management’s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters during this process. Any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:•a significant change in commodity prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; •a material orebody may prove to be below expectations; •difficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; and •the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. In addition, in connection with an acquisition, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing stockholders. The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock, or assure that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may negatively affect results of operations. 11The completion of the previously announced Paramount and Wharf gold mine acquisitions are subject to us obtaining all required third party regulatory and governmental approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions to completion of the acquisitions, and, in the case of the Paramount acquisition, obtaining approval of the Company’s stockholders. There can be no assurance that the Company or the acquisition counterparty will be able to satisfy these conditions on a timely basis or at all. In addition, the Company’s systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from these acquisitions. The Company’s future operating results could be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage the changing business conditions and to integrate the Paramount assets and the Wharf gold mine operation into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that the Company failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with these announced acquisitions. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or future prospects.The Company’s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market fair value adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk.From time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold and silver and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments.Any use of forward or futures contracts can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss. The use of derivative contracts may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks in the countries in which it has significant operations or interests.A majority of the Company’s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States, and it is subject to significant risks inherent in mineral extraction by foreign companies and contracts with government owned entities. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company’s control. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted. The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company’s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.These risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company’s exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations.The Company’s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities, including indigenous peoples, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding the Company’s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities, which may result in civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.12The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks.The Company’s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company’s foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. The Company sells gold and silver doré in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect results of operations.Silver and gold mining involves significant production and operational risks.Silver and gold mining involves significant production and operational risks, including those related to uncertain mineral exploration success, unexpected geological or mining conditions, the difficulty of development of new deposits, unfavorable climate conditions, equipment or service failures, current unavailability of or delays in installing and commissioning plants and equipment, import or customs delays and other general operating risks.Commencement of mining can reveal mineralization or geologic formations, including higher than expected content of other minerals that can be difficult to separate from silver, which can result in unexpectedly low recovery rates. Problems also may arise due to the quality or failure of locally obtained equipment or interruptions to services (such as power, water, fuel or transport or processing capacity) or technical support, which could result in the failure to achieve expected target dates for exploration, or could cause production activities to require greater capital expenditure to achieve expected recoveries. Many of these production and operational risks are beyond the Company’s control. Delays in commencing successful mining activities at new or expanded mines, disruptions in production and low recovery rates could have adverse effects on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. The Company’s results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates.The ore reserve figures presented in the Company’s public filings are estimates made by the Company’s technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom the Company contracts. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its reserve estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company’s estimates of future production, costs, and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors and may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.The Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production, costs and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Such estimates are made by the Company’s management and technical personnel and depend on numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of ore, the Company’s costs of production, the market prices of silver and gold, the Company’s ability to sustain and increase production levels, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any such production, cost, or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.13Forward sales and royalty arrangements can result in limiting the Company’s ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices.The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for gold or silver. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property on favorable terms or to achieve other business objectives. Royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company’s ability to realize the full effects of rising gold or silver prices and require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels.The Company’s future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations.As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $478.4 million of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, the Company's total debt excludes $34.0 million for future minimum estimated gold production royalty payments due from Coeur Mexicana to Franco-Nevada. The liabilities associated with these gold production royalty payments increase as the price of gold increases. The Company’s ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company’s results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of silver and gold. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service debt, it may need to further refinance debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds.The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms.The Company might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to meet capital needs, conduct business, make payments when due or refinance debt.The Company might need to raise additional funds in order to meet capital needs, implement its business plan, refinance debt or acquire complementary assets. Any required additional financing might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.Any downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to the Company’s debt securities could increase future borrowing costs and adversely affect the availability of new financing.There can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services or Moody’s Investors Service to the Company will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If the Company is unable to maintain its outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should the Company’s business prospects or financial results deteriorate, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of the Company’s outstanding debt securities, its existing debt and its ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, and increase borrowing costs, which in turn could impair the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company’s ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income.The Company recognizes the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized, otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that taxable income differs significantly from estimates, the Company’s ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit the Company’s ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2014, the Company’s current and long-term deferred tax assets were $7.4 million and $60.2 million, respectively.14The Company’s business is subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.The Company operates in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption to some degree. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. The Company’s Code of Business Ethics and Conduct and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. There can be no assurance that the Company’s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts committed by the Company’s affiliates, employees or agents. As such, the Company’s corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company’s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position and results of operations.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration, development and mining activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company’s business.The Company’s ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; completion of favorable feasibility studies; issuance and maintenance of necessary permits; and receipt of adequate financing. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, exploration projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by smelter customers could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.The Company currently markets gold concentrates to third-party smelters in China and Japan. The loss of any one smelter could have a material adverse effect on the Company if alternative smelters were unavailable. The Company cannot ensure that alternative smelters would be available if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.15Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington and Rochester mines are continuously inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, the MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. In addition, any of the Company’s U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shutdown as a result of a violation alleged by the MSHA. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company’s operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Some of the mining wastes from the Company’s U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “USEPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the USEPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault, and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The 16owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company’s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA.Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada and Alaska. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals related to climate change, including legislation pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.Continuation of the Company’s mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies. The Company’s mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, the Company’s properties in Mexico are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on the Company’s ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of the Company’s operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, the Company cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company’s control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct the Company's operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water could require the Company to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which the Company operates which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting the Company’s operations.The Company relies on third parties who own, maintain and operate the mines underlying its streaming and royalty assets.The Endeavor mine is owned, maintained and operated by Cobar, a wholly owned subsidiary of CBH. However, pursuant to a silver sale and purchase agreement, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd. (“CDE Australia”), has acquired all silver production and reserves at the Endeavor mine, up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces. CDE Australia has agreed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver plus 50% of the amount by which the silver price exceeds $7.00 per ounce, subject to annual adjustments for inflation. In addition, the Company currently holds a tiered royalty on McEwen Mining Inc.’s El Gallo/Magistral mine in Mexico, currently paying a 3.5% NSR, a 1.5% NSR on Dynasty Metals & Mining, Inc.’s Zaruma mine in Ecuador, a 2.0% NSR on Mandalay Resources Corp.’s Cerro Bayo mine in Chile, and an 80% interest in a 2.5% royalty on Newmont Mining Corporation’s Correnso mine in New Zealand, as well as several royalties on mining assets that are not yet developed and plans to acquire additional streaming and royalty interests in the future.The Company relies on third parties to own, maintain and operate the mining projects underlying its royalty and streaming interests, which exposes it to substantial counterparty risk. These third parties may fail to adequately or appropriately operate or maintain their respective projects or may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with the Company.The Company cannot ensure that each of these third parties will not suffer financial hardship, will continue as a going concern or will not enter bankruptcy or otherwise liquidate. Any such event could expose the Company to significant costs and could limit the amounts, if any, the Company could recover in any proceeding against any such third party for breach of their agreement with the Company. There can be no assurance that the production from any of these mining operations will meet forecasted production targets. At any time, any of the owners or operators of these mining operations may decide to suspend or discontinue operations. In addition, the owners or operators of projects that are not yet operational in which the Company may hold royalty or streaming interests may decide to delay or not to proceed with commencing commercial production. Any failure, inability or refusal of a counterparty to meet its obligations to the Company under these royalty or streaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.The Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. The Company’s ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists.In the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects. Obtaining and renewing governmental 17permits is a complex and time-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company's control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company's expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company's revenues and future growth.Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine.In June 2013, Coeur submitted a proposed amendment to the plan of operations for the Rochester mine (“POA 10”) to the BLM to expand leach pad capacity. Absent POA 10 approval, Coeur anticipates that the capacity under the existing leach pad will be insufficient after 2017. If POA 10 is not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, the Company’s future growth plans at Rochester could be materially adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s exploration projects, La Preciosa and Joaquin, are subject to significant development, operational and regulatory risks.As exploration projects, La Preciosa and Joaquin are subject to numerous risks. The economic feasibility of an exploration project is based on many factors such as: estimation of mineral reserves, anticipated metallurgical recoveries, environmental considerations and permitting, future metals prices, and anticipated capital and operating costs of these projects. For the La Preciosa project, the Company’s 2014 feasibility study derived estimates of costs and economic returns based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of reserves to be mined and processed, the configuration of the mineral body, expected recovery rates, estimated expenditures, anticipated climatic conditions and other factors. As a result, it is possible that actual costs and economic returns will differ significantly from those estimated for the project in the feasibility study. Further, when the Company ultimately determines to proceed with project construction, the Company may be unable to complete project and environmental permitting within an economically acceptable time frame.As a result of these and related risks, future estimates of or actual costs and economic returns of the La Preciosa and Joaquin projects may materially differ from the estimated costs and returns for these projects.The Company’s operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks.In May 2014, the new Bolivian mining law was enacted. The Company has been assessing the potential effects of the legislation on its Bolivian operations but any effects remain uncertain until the regulations implementing the law are enacted. The law regulates royalties and provides for mining contracts with the government rather than concession holding.  If the regulations promulgated under the new mining law mandate a renegotiation of the terms of our existing contracts with the Bolivian state-owned mining company, Corporacion Minera de Bolivia (“COMIBOL”) and the mining cooperatives, this could materially adversely affect the profitability and cash flow of our operations in Bolivia. It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may further affect mining in Bolivia.In addition, companies are also operating under Law No. 403 of September 18, 2013, and its regulatory Supreme Decree, which provides for the reversion of mining rights if the Ministry of Mines verifies that a person with mining rights has not initiated mining activities or developed the mining rights. The contracts with COMIBOL and the cooperatives are excluded from the application of Law No. 403. In April 2014, our subsidiary in Bolivia was served by the Bolivian government with a reversion decision affecting nine mining rights wholly-owned by our subsidiary. The affected area is not in an area of active mining by the Company and the Company’s San Bartolomé operations were not targeted as an area of interest in the decision since all of our past and current mining activity is performed through our contracts with COMIBOL and the mining cooperatives.On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken.  The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts with COMIBOL as well as under authorized contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights under contract themselves with COMIBOL. The Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea 18level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction.  Mining in other areas above the 4,400 meter level continues to be suspended.The suspension may reduce production until the Company is able to resume mining above 4,400 meters. It is uncertain at this time how long the suspension will remain in place.  If COMIBOL decides to restrict access above the 4,400 meter level on a permanent basis, the Company may need to write down the carrying value of the asset. It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.Although the Company previously carried political risk insurance with respect to the San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia, it no longer does. In determining whether to renew the coverage, the Company based its assessment on the political risk environment and the likelihood of a timely and material claim payout against the cost of carrying political risk insurance, which was approximately $2.1 million per year as of the most recent period ended December 16, 2013.The Company’s business depends on good relations with its employees.The Company may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. During the past three years, two of the Company’s mines have experienced work stoppages, each of which was resolved within a short period of time and had no material effect on operations. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.At December 31, 2014, unions represented approximately 12% of the Company’s global workforce, all of which were comprised of workers at the San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia. The Company has a labor agreement at the San Bartolomé mine which is in effect for 2015. The Company cannot predict whether this agreement will be renewed on similar terms or at all, whether future labor disruptions will occur or, if disruptions do occur, how long they will last.Disputes regarding the Company’s mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company’s mining projects, could adversely impact operations.The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company’s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standard, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company’s exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company’s projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation. In Bolivia, we obtain surface rights from cooperatives, through a series of “joint venture” contracts. Changes to the existing agreements or leases or failure to reach agreement in any negotiations may have a significant impact on operations at the Company’s projects and may, on occasion, lead to litigation. Further, the Bolivian government under Law No. 403 may have the ability to reverse our wholly-owned mining rights. Any such reversion decision could adversely impact our future mining plans.The Company is subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.In connection with the announcement of the Paramount acquisition, lawsuits have been filed and are pending as of the date hereof, seeking, among other things, to enjoin the transaction, and an adverse ruling in any of these lawsuits may prevent the transaction from being effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame. While Paramount’s and Coeur’s respective directors and management teams believe that the allegations in the complaints are without merit and intend to defend 19vigorously against these allegations, the Company cannot make assurances as to the outcome of these, or any similar future lawsuits, including the costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation or settlement of these claims. If any plaintiffs are successful in obtaining an injunction with respect to the merger, such an injunction may prevent the completion of the transaction on the agreed upon terms, in the expected time frame or altogether. Whether the plaintiffs’ claims are successful, this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of Coeur’s business.In addition, the Company is currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. For a more detailed discussion of pending litigation, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company’s foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels, or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. The Company’s inability to enforce its rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of the Company's existing stockholders' equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected"
18,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2014-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The Company's results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold and other commodities, which are volatile and beyond the Company's control. The Company's use of derivative contracts to protect against such volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market accounting adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk. Silver and gold are commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, the price of silver ranged from a low of $18.70 per ounce to a high of $32.31 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,192 per ounce to a high of $1,694 per ounce.  During the fourth quarter of 2013, the price of silver ranged from a low of $19.10 per ounce to a high of $23.03 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,195 per ounce to a high of $1,361 per ounce.  The closing market prices of silver and gold on February 21, 2014 were $21.72 per ounce and $1,323 per ounce, respectively. Silver and gold prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company's control, including prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in the prices of silver and gold include a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net outflows from gold and silver ETFs, bullion sales by private and government holders and a general global economic slowdown.Because the Company derives all of its revenues from sales of silver and gold, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals increase or decrease. A sustained period of declining gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect the results of operations and cash flows.  Additionally, if market prices for silver and gold decline or remain at relatively low levels for a sustained period of time, The Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. The Company may be unable to decrease its costs in an amount sufficient to offset reductions in revenues, and may incur losses.Operating costs at the Company's mines are affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and 10other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. Since the beginning of 2011, the Company has made strategic minority investments in eight silver and gold development companies in North and South America. The value of these investments depends significantly on the market prices of silver and gold. The value of these investments has declined, and the Company cannot assure that the value of these investments, or the value of future investments it may make in other development companies, will not decline further. Declines in the value of these investments could adversely affect the Company's financial condition. A significant and sustained decline in gold and silver prices during 2013 caused the Company to write down its long-lived assets and, in the future such declines could cause one or more of the Company’s mining properties to become unprofitable, which could require the Company to record additional write-downs of long-lived assets. Such write-downs may adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.    The Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board’s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360 (“ASC 360”). Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of the cost of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset’s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company conducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.    The Company’s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets as of December 31, 2013 under ASC 360 indicated that a write-down of its long-lived assets at December 31, 2013 of approximately $773 million was required. This non-cash write-down resulted in an impairment charge in the Company's statement of comprehensive income (loss) and reduced the carrying value of mining properties and property, plant and equipment on the Company’s balance sheet. See Note 4 -- Write-Downs in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.    If there are further significant and sustained declines in silver and gold prices or if the currently low silver or gold prices remain at such prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company’s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company may record other types of additional mining property charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any such additional write-downs of mining properties could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market accounting adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk.From time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of its products and changes in the price of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other contracts. Any such use of forward or futures contracts can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss. The use of derivative contracts may also result in significant mark-to-market accounting adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of non-performance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks in the countries in which it has significant operations or interests. A majority of the Company's revenues are generated by operations outside the United States, and it is subject to significant risks inherent in resource extraction by foreign companies and contracts with government owned entities. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company's control. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced re-negotiation of contracts, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted. The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or 11denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company's rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups. Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company's exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations.     The Company’s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities (including indigenous peoples) and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other community benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding the Company’s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities, which may result in civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it.  Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company's operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. The Company's operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company's foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company's ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.  The Company sells gold and silver doré in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could adversely affect results of operations. Silver and gold mining involves significant production and operational risks. Silver and gold mining involves significant production and operational risks, including those related to uncertain mineral exploration success, unexpected geological or mining conditions, the difficulty of development of new deposits, unfavorable climate conditions, equipment or service failures, current unavailability of or delays in installing and commissioning plants and equipment, import or customs delays and other general operating risks. Commencement of mining can reveal mineralization or geologic formations, including higher than expected content of other minerals that can be difficult to separate from silver, which can result in unexpectedly low recovery rates. Problems also may arise due to the quality or failure of locally obtained equipment or interruptions to services (such as power, water, fuel or transport or processing capacity) or technical support, which could result in the failure to achieve expected target dates for exploration, or could cause production activities to require greater capital expenditure to achieve expected recoveries. Many of these production and operational risks are beyond the Company's control. Delays in commencing successful mining activities at new or expanded mines, disruptions in production and low recovery rates could have adverse effects on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. The Company's results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates. The ore reserve figures presented in the Company's public filings are estimates made by the Company's technical personnel and by independent mining consultants contracted by it. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its 12reserve estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company’s estimates of future production are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors and may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.The Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production. Any such information is forward-looking. Such estimates are made by the Company’s management and technical personnel and depend on numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of ore, the Company’s costs of production, its ability to sustain and increase production levels, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any such production estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.For instance, in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2013, the Company provided production estimates under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Production Outlook Detail.” Such information included estimates of expected silver and gold production through 2016. These estimates were based on mine plans and other assumptions existing at such time, which mine plans and assumptions change from time to time. The Company has not updated such projections for years other than 2014 for new or different information arising after September 30, 2013, and therefore the Company cannot assure you that such estimates continue to be accurate or that it would provide the same estimates as of the date of this report. See “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.”Forward sales and royalty arrangements can result in limiting the Company's ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices. The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for gold or silver. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property on favorable terms or to achieve other business objectives. Royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company's ability to realize the full effects of rising gold or silver prices and require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels. The Company's future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2013, the Company had a total of approximately $382.5 million of outstanding indebtedness, which includes $73.9 million for future estimated royalty payments on gold production at Palmarejo. The liabilities associated with such royalty payments increase as the price of gold increases. The Company's ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company's results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of silver and gold. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service debt, it may need to further refinance debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds. The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. The Company's future growth will depend upon its ability to develop new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition from other mining companies.     Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, an important element of the Company's business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines, properties and businesses or interests therein. During 2011, the Company successfully constructed a new leach pad at the Company's Rochester mine. Development of other major mining properties at Palmarejo, San Bartolomé and Kensington has been substantially completed. Since December 2012, the Company has owned 100% of the Joaquin silver- gold development project located in the Santa Cruz province of southern Argentina.  As a result of its acquisition of Orko Silver Corp. (now Coeur La Preciosa Silver Corp.) in April 2013, the Company also holds the La Preciosa silver-gold project in the state of Durango, Mexico. The Company's ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing existing properties and developing or acquiring new mining properties. Both strategies are inherently risky, and the Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully develop existing or new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.    13While it is the Company's practice to engage independent mining consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any mining properties or interests that it may acquire may not be developed profitably. If profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing stockholders. The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock, or assure that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may negatively affect results of operations.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration, development and mining activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company's business.The Company's ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.  Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.     The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; completion of favorable feasibility studies; issuance and maintenance of necessary permits; and receipt of adequate financing.. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.In addition, development projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Development project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of any and all development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.The Company might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to meet capital needs, conduct business, make payments when due or refinance debt. The Company might need to raise additional funds in order to meet capital needs, implement its business plan, refinance debt or acquire complementary businesses or products. Any required additional financing might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock. The Company’s newly acquired silver-gold project, La Preciosa, is subject to significant development, operational and regulatory risks.As a development phase project, La Preciosa is subject to numerous risks. These risks include uncertainty as to the development of the La Preciosa project in accordance with current expectations or at all, and the ultimate extent, quality, grade and mineability of mineralization. Further, the Company may be unable to complete project and environmental permitting within an economically acceptable time frame. The recently completed preliminary economic assessment, or PEA, for the La Preciosa project does not have sufficient certainty to constitute a pre-feasibility study or a feasibility study. The PEA includes mineralized material that is considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to it that would enable the material to be categorized as proven and probable reserves. The Company cannot assure that the results reflected in the PEA will be realized or that it will ever be in a position to identify proven and probable reserves at the La Preciosa project. In particular, the PEA uses estimated capital costs and operating costs which are based on factors including tonnage and grades of metal expected to be mined and processed and expected recovery rates, none of which has been completed to a pre-feasibility study or a feasibility study level. While the Company is currently conducting a feasibility study on the La Preciosa project, the ultimate identification of proven 14and probable reserves will depend on a number of factors, including the attributes of the deposit (including size, grade, geological formation and proximity to infrastructure), metal prices, government regulations (including regulations pertaining to taxes, royalties, land use, international trade and permitting) and environmental protections. It is possible that proven and probable reserves will never be identified at the La Preciosa project, which would inhibit the Company’s ability to develop the La Preciosa project into a commercial mining operation. In addition, following completion of the feasibility study, the Company may determine not to proceed with project construction.The Company plans to configure and design the La Preciosa project as a large-tonnage, open pit operation in an effort to maximize annual production and mine life. However, the Company may be unable to obtain the permits required for this design scope, or may be unable to complete the design in a manner that complies with environmental laws. Further, geological or technological impediments to extraction and processing may render the engineering impracticable or uneconomic.As a result of these and related risks, future estimates of or actual cash operating costs and economic returns of the La Preciosa project may materially differ from these estimated costs and returns for this project, and accordingly, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by smelter customers could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. The Company currently markets silver and gold concentrates to third-party smelters and refineries in China and Japan. The loss of any one smelter could have a material adverse effect on the Company if alternative smelters and refineries were unavailable. The Company cannot ensure that alternative smelters or refineries would be available if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. The Company's silver and gold production may decline in the future, reducing its results of operations and cash flows. The Company's silver and gold production, unless it is able to develop or acquire new properties, will decline over time due to the exhaustion of reserves and the possible closure of mines in response to declining metals prices or other factors. Identifying promising mining properties is difficult and speculative. The Company encounters strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing silver and gold. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than the Company does. Consequently, the Company may be unable to replace and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms that are considered acceptable. As a result, revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth. The Company cannot assure that it would be able to replace the production that would be lost due to the exhaustion of reserves and the possible closure of mines. There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available to us or to other companies in the industry. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business. Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties. U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington and Rochester mines are continuously inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, the MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective 15measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. In addition, any of the Company's U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shut down as a result of a violation alleged by the MSHA. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company's operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Some of the Company's mining wastes currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of federal Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA designates these wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held liable and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government's cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company's tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA. Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada and Alaska. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals related to climate change, including legislation pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption of these proposals could have a materially adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows. The Company relies on third parties who own, maintain and operate the mines underlying its royalty and streaming assets.The Endeavor mine is owned, maintained and operated by Cobar, a wholly owned subsidiary of CBH. However, pursuant to a silver sale and purchase agreement, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd. (“CDE Australia”), has acquired all silver production and reserves at the Endeavor mine, up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces. CDE Australia has agreed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver plus 50% of the amount by which the silver price exceeds $7.00 per ounce, subject to annual adjustments for inflation. In addition, the Company currently holds a tiered royalty on McEwen Mining Inc.’s El Gallo/Magistral mine in Mexico, currently paying a 3.5% NSR, a 1.5% NSR on Dynasty Metals & Mining, Inc.’s Zaruma mine in Ecuador and a 2.0% NSR on Mandalay Resources Corp.’s Cerro Bayo mine in Chile, and plans to acquire additional royalty and streaming interests in the future.The Company relies on third parties to own, maintain and operate the mining projects underlying its royalty and streaming interests, which exposes it to substantial counterparty risk. These third parties may fail to adequately or appropriately operate or maintain their respective projects or may be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under their agreements with the Company. 16The Company cannot ensure that each of these third parties will not suffer financial hardship, will continue as a going concern or will not enter bankruptcy or otherwise liquidate. Any such event could expose the Company to significant costs and could limit the amounts, if any, the Company could recover in any proceeding against any such third party for breach of their agreement with the Company. There can be no assurance that the silver or gold production from any of these mining operations will meet forecasted production targets. At any time, any of the owners or operators of these mining operations may decide to suspend or discontinue operations. In addition, the owners or operators of projects that are not yet operational in which the Company may hold royalty or streaming interests may decide to delay or not to proceed with commencing commercial production.Any failure, inability or refusal of a counterparty to meet its obligations to the Company under these royalty or streaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.The Company's ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists. Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. An environmental organization, Great Basin Resource Watch (“GBRW”) has brought an administrative appeal challenging the Bureau of Land Management's approval in October 2010 of a plan of amendment which allows active mining to be resumed and a new heap leach pad to be constructed at the Rochester property. However, because GBRW did not seek a stay of the BLM's decision, operations have been proceeding as approved during the IBLA proceeding. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the appeal or what effect, if any, an adverse ruling may have on current operations. If an adverse ruling is issued, the Company may be required to update the permitting for the current operations at Rochester.The Company's operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks. The Bolivian government adopted a new constitution in early 2009 that strengthened state control over key economic sectors such as mining. In connection with the 2009 constitution, the government of Bolivia announced a restructuring of the mining law. A commission was established in March 2011 to finalize the mining law updates. In July 2013, the commission officially presented to the Bolivian government a draft of a new mining law. The new law has not yet been approved, and the Bolivian government continues to analyze the draft law with various governmental entities. The Company has been assessing the potential effects of the proposed legislation on its Bolivian operations but any effects remain uncertain until the law is enacted. The law is expected to regulate taxation and royalties and to provide for contracting with the government rather than concession holding. The revised mining law is expected to be enacted in 2014. The Company cannot assure that its operations at the San Bartolomé mine will not be affected by the current political environment in Bolivia.At this time, pending the enactment of the new mining law, companies are operating under Law No. 403 of September 18, 2013, and its regulatory Supreme Decree, which established cause for the reversion of mining rights under Bolivia’s Special Transitory Authorizations and Mining Contracts. Under Law No. 403, if the Ministry of Mines verifies that a person with mining rights has not initiated mining activities or developed the mining rights, the Ministry of Mines will report to the Mining Jurisdictional Authority, in which case the Mining Jurisdictional Authority is designated to resolve the reversion of the mining rights, without prejudice to preexisting environmental liabilities. The contracts with the cooperatives are excluded from the application of Law No. 403.On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining company, Corporación Minera de Bolivia (“COMIBOL”), announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of the Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts with COMIBOL as well as under authorized contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights under contract themselves with COMIBOL. The Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The Cooperative Reserva Fiscal, with which the Company has one of those contracts, subsequently interpreted the COMIBOL resolution and determined that the Huacajchi deposit was not covered by such resolution. In March 2010, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal notified COMIBOL that, based on its interpretation, it was resuming mining of high-grade material above the 4,400 meter level in the Huacajchi deposit. In December 2011, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal sent a similar notification to COMIBOL with respect to a further area above the 4,400 meter level known as Huacajchi Sur. Based on these notifications and on the absence of any objection from COMIBOL, the Company resumed mining operations at the San Bartolomé mine on the Huacajchi deposit and Huacajchi Sur in 2012. Mining in other areas above the 4,400 meter level continue to be suspended. The partial suspension may reduce production until the Company is able to resume mining above 4,400 meters generally. It is uncertain at this time how long the suspension will remain in place. In addition, it is possible that COMIBOL may decide that the Company’s operations at the 17Huacajchi deposit or Huacajchi Sur are subject to the COMIBOL resolution, which may force it to ultimately cease mining at such deposits. If COMIBOL objects to the Company’s mining at the Huacajchi deposit or Huacajchi Sur or if the other restrictions are not lifted, the Company may need to write down the carrying value of the asset. It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.The Company's business depends on good relations with its employees. The Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. During the past three years, two of the Company's mines have experienced work stoppages, each of which was resolved within a short period of time and had no material effect on operations. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. As of December 31, 2013, unions represented approximately 10.4% of the Company's worldwide workforce, all of which were composed of workers at the San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia. The Company currently has a labor agreement at the San Bartolomé mine which is in effect for 2014. The Company cannot predict whether this agreement will be renewed, whether future labor disruptions will occur or, if disruptions do occur, how long they will last.  Disputes regarding the Company's mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company’s mining projects, could adversely impact operations.The validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company’s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standard, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties.  Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company's exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company's projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.  In Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, ejidos (communal owners of land recognized by the federal laws in Mexico) control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation.  In Bolivia, we sublease surface rights from cooperatives, through a series of “joint venture” contracts. Changes to the existing agreements or leases or failure to reach agreement in any negotiations may have a significant impact on operations at the Company’s projects and may, on occasion, lead to litigation.The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of the Company's existing stockholders' equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected"
12,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2013-02-21,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 The Company's results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold and other commodities, which are volatile and beyond the Company's control. The Company's use of derivative contracts to protect against such volatility exposes us to risk of opportunity loss, mark-to-market accounting adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk. Silver and gold are commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the last twelve months ended December 31, 2012, the price of silver ranged from a low of $26.39 per ounce to a high of $36.88 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,540 per ounce to a high of $1,792 per ounce.  During the fourth quarter of 2012, the price of silver ranged from a low of $29.73 per ounce to a high of $34.89 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,651 per ounce to a high of $1,792 per ounce.  The closing market prices of silver and gold on February 20, 2013 were $28.57 per ounce and $1,565 per ounce, respectively. Silver and gold prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company's control, including prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Because the Company derives all of its revenues from sales of silver and gold, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals increase or decrease. A sustained period of declining gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect the results of operations and cash flows. Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in the prices of silver and gold include a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net outflows from gold and silver ETFs, bullion sales by private and government holders and a general global economic slowdown. In addition, operating costs at the Company's mines are affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of its products and changes in the price of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other contracts. Any such use of forward or futures contracts can expose us to risk of an opportunity loss. The use of derivative contracts may also result in significant mark-to-market accounting adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counter-parties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of non-performance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract. Since the beginning of 2011, the Company has made strategic minority investments in eight silver and gold development companies in North and South America. The value of these investments depends significantly on the market prices of silver and gold. The Company cannot assure that the value of these investments, or the value of future investments it may make in other development companies, will not decline. Declines in the value of these investments could adversely affect the Company's financial condition. 12A substantial decline in gold and silver prices could cause one or more of the Company's mining properties to become unprofitable, which could require it to record write-downs of long-lived assets that would adversely affect results of operations and financial condition. Established accounting standards for impairment of the value of long-lived assets such as mining properties requires the Company to review the recoverability of the cost of its assets upon a triggering event by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset's carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. A significant and sustained decline in silver or gold prices, or our failure to control production costs or realize the minable ore reserves at the Company's mining properties, could lead it to terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties and require a write down of the carrying value of the assets. Any such actions would negatively affect results of operations and financial condition. The Company may record other types of additional mining property charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any such additional write-downs of mining properties could adversely affect results of operations and financial condition. The Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks in the countries in which it has significant operations or interests. A majority of the Company's revenues are generated by operations outside the United States, and it is subject to significant risks inherent in resource extraction by foreign companies and contracts with government owned entities. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company's control. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced re-negotiation of contracts, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which operations are conducted. The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company's rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups. Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These risks may be higher in developing countries in which the Company may expand its exploration for and development of mineral deposits. Potential operations in these areas increase the Company's exposure to risks of war, local economic conditions, political disruption, civil disturbance and governmental policies that may disrupt its operations. The Company's operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. The Company's operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company's foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company's ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.  The Company sells gold and silver doré in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could adversely affect results of operations. Silver and gold mining involves significant production and operational risks. Silver and gold mining involves significant production and operational risks, including those related to uncertain mineral exploration success, unexpected geological or mining conditions, the difficulty of development of new deposits, unfavorable climate conditions, equipment or service failures, current unavailability of or delays in installing and commissioning plants and equipment, import or customs delays and other general operating risks. Commencement of mining can reveal mineralization or geologic formations, including higher than expected content of other minerals that can be difficult to separate from silver, which can result in unexpectedly low recovery rates. Problems also may arise due to the quality or failure of locally obtained equipment or interruptions to services (such as power, water, fuel or transport or processing capacity) or technical support, which could result in the failure to achieve expected target dates for exploration, or could cause production activities to require greater capital expenditure to achieve expected recoveries. 13Many of these production and operational risks are beyond the Company's control. Delays in commencing successful mining activities at new or expanded mines, disruptions in production and low recovery rates could have adverse effects on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. The Company's results of operations and financial position may be negatively affected by inaccurate estimates. The ore reserve figures presented in the Company's public filings are estimates made by the Company's technical personnel and by independent mining consultants contracted by it. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its reserve estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Forward sales and royalty arrangements can result in limiting the Company's ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices. The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for gold or silver. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property on favorable terms. Royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company's ability to realize the full effects of rising gold or silver prices and require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels. The Company's future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2012, the Company had a total of approximately $121.4 million of outstanding indebtedness, which includes $61.9 million for future estimated gold production royalty payments due to Franco-Nevada Corporation, $48.1 million of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the “3.25% Convertible Senior Notes”) and capital lease obligations of $11.4  million. The liabilities associated with such royalty payments increase as the price of gold increases. The Company's ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company's results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of silver and gold. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service debt, it may need to further refinance debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds. The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. The Company's future growth will depend upon its ability to develop new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition from other mining companies. Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, an important element of the Company's business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines, properties and businesses or interests therein. During 2011, the Company successfully constructed a new leach pad at the Company's Rochester mine and substantially completed development of  other major mining properties at Palmarejo, San Bartolomé and Kensington. The Company's ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing  existing properties and developing or acquiring new mining properties. Both strategies are inherently risky, and the Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully compete in either the development of existing or new mining properties or acquisitions of additional mining properties. While it is the Company's practice to engage independent mining consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any mining properties or interests that it may acquire may not be developed profitably. If profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. The Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its business or common stock or that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may negatively affect results of operations. 14In addition, since the beginning of 2011, the Company has also made strategic minority investments in eight silver and gold development companies in North and South America.  As of December 31, 2012, the Company's investments in these companies had an estimated fair value of $27.1 million. The Company cannot assure that the value of these investments, or the value of future investments it may make in other development companies, will not decline.  Declines in the value of these investments could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.Mineral exploration and development inherently involves significant and irreducible financial risks. The Company may suffer from the failure to find and develop profitable mines. The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant financial risks that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge cannot eliminate. Unprofitable efforts may result from the failure to discover mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic feasibility of any development project is based upon, among other things, volatile metals prices, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources such as water and power, metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs. Development projects also are subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; and mineral prices. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration, development and mining activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company's business. The Company's ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. The economic feasibility of any development project is based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs of such development projects, and metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing. Development projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Development project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of any and all development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. The Company might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to meet capital needs, conduct business, make payments when due or refinance debt. The Company might need to raise additional funds in order to meet capital needs, implement its business plan, refinance debt or acquire complementary businesses or products. Any required additional financing might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock. 15A significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by smelter customers could have a material adverse effect on operations. The Company currently markets silver and gold concentrates to third-party smelters and refineries in Mexico, Germany, China, Australia, and the United States. The loss of any one smelter could have a material adverse effect on the Company if alternative smelters and refineries were unavailable. The Company cannot assure you that alternative smelters or refineries would be available if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations. The Company's silver and gold production may decline in the future, reducing its results of operations and cash flows. The Company's silver and gold production, unless it is able to develop or acquire new properties, will decline over time due to the exhaustion of reserves and the possible closure of mines in response to declining metals prices or other factors. Identifying promising mining properties is difficult and speculative. The Company encounters strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing silver and gold. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than the Company does. Consequently, the Company may be unable to replace and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms that are considered acceptable. As a result, revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth. The Company cannot assure that it would be able to replace the production that would be lost due to the exhaustion of reserves and the possible closure of mines. There are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available to us or to other companies in the industry. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operation, cash flows and financial condition. The Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business. Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties. U.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington and Rochester mines are continuously inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, the MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general.Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. In addition, any of the Company's U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shut down as a result of a violation alleged by the MSHA. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such penalties, fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility 16for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company's operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a negative effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Some of the Company's mining wastes currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of federal Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”). If the EPA designates these wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a mining facility, that facility could be designated as a “Superfund” site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held liable and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the government's cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company's tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA. Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada and Alaska. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals related to climate change, including legislation pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption of these proposals could have a materially adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows. The Company relies on third parties to operate, maintain and produce silver for it at the Endeavor mine. The Endeavor mine is owned, maintained and operated by Cobar Operations Pty. Limited (“Cobar”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBH Resources Ltd. (“CBH”). However, pursuant to a silver sale and purchase agreement, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, CDE Australia Pty. Ltd. (“CDE Australia”), has acquired all silver production and reserves at the Endeavor mine, up to a total of 20.0 million payable ounces. CDE Australia has agreed to pay Cobar an operating cost contribution of $1.00 for each ounce of payable silver plus 50% of the amount by which the silver price exceeds $7.00 per ounce, subject to annual adjustments for inflation. Under this arrangement, the Company relies on Cobar to own, maintain and operate the Endeavor mine, which exposes it to substantial counterparty risk. Cobar may fail to adequately or appropriately operate or maintain the project or may fail to fulfill its other obligations under the silver purchase agreement. The Company cannot assure that Cobar will not suffer financial hardship, that it will continue as a going concern or that it will not enter bankruptcy or otherwise liquidate. Any such event could expose the Company to significant costs and could limit the amounts, if any, it could recover in any proceeding against CBH or Cobar for breach of the silver purchase agreement. Any failure, inability or refusal of Cobar to meet its obligations to the Company could have a material and adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. The Company's ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists. Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. An environmental organization, Great Basin Resource Watch (“GBRW”) has brought an administrative appeal challenging the Bureau of Land Management's approval of a plan of amendment which allows active mining to be resumed and a new heap leach pad to be constructed at the Rochester property. The Interior Board of Land Appeals (“IBLA”) is expected to rule on the 17appeal in the first half of 2013.  However, because GBRW did not seek a stay of the BLM's decision, operations have been proceeding as approved during the IBLA proceeding. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the appeal or what effect, if any, an adverse ruling may have on current operations. If an adverse ruling is issued, the Company may be required to update the permitting for the current operations at Rochester. The Company's operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks. The Bolivian government adopted a new constitution in early 2009 that strengthened state control over key economic sectors such as mining. In connection with the 2009 constitution, the government of Bolivia announced a restructuring of the mining law. A commission was established in March 2011 to finalize the mining law updates and the commission's evaluation remains ongoing. The Company has been assessing the potential effects of the proposed legislation on its Bolivian operations but any effects remain uncertain until the law is enacted. The law is expected to regulate taxation and royalties and to provide for contracting with the government rather than concession holding. The revised mining law is expected to be enacted in the first half of 2013. The Company cannot assure that its operations at the San Bartolomé mine will not be affected by the current political environment in Bolivia. On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining company, Corporación Minera de Bolivia (“COMIBOL”), announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of the Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine above this elevation under valid contracts with COMIBOL as well as under authorized contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights under contract themselves with COMIBOL. The Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The Cooperative Reserva Fiscal, with which the Company has one of those contracts, subsequently interpreted the COMIBOL resolution and determined that the Huacajchi deposit was not covered by such resolution. In March 2010, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal notified COMIBOL that, based on its interpretation, it was resuming mining of high grade material above the 4,400 meter level in the Huacajchi deposit. In December 2011, the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal sent a similar notification to COMIBOL with respect to a further area above the 4,400 meter level known as Huacajchi Sur. Based on these notifications and on the absence of any objection from COMIBOL, the Company resumed mining operations at the San Bartolomé mine on the Huacajchi deposit and Huacajchi Sur. Mining in other areas above the 4,400 meter level continue to be suspended. The partial suspension may reduce production until the Company is able to resume mining above 4,400 meters generally. It is uncertain at this time how long the suspension will remain in place. In addition, it is possible that COMIBOL may decide that the Company's operations at the Huacajchi deposit or Huacajchi Sur are subject to the COMIBOL resolution, which may force the Company to cease mining at such deposits. If COMIBOL objects to the Company mining at the Huacajchi deposit or Huacajchi Sur or if the other restrictions are not lifted, it may need to write down the carrying value of the asset. It is also uncertain if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia. The Company's business depends on good relations with its employees. The Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. During the past three years, two of the Company's mines have experienced work stoppages, each of which was resolved within a short period of time and had no material effect on operations. Most recently, in May 2012, a small, unorganized group of employees at the Palmarejo mine blocked access to the mine. Palmarejo management supervised an orderly, temporary shut-down of the mine and mill in order to allow for dialogue with employees while ensuring the safety of workers at the mine site. Management considered the actions taken by the group to be illegal. Within approximately five days, the group agreed to return to work and full production resumed at the mine. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material and adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. As of December 31, 2012, unions represented approximately 10.0% of the Company's worldwide workforce. The Company currently has a labor agreement at its San Bartolomé mine, which became effective January 28, 2010 and does not have a fixed term. The Company cannot predict whether this agreement will be renewed, whether future labor disruptions will occur or, if disruptions do occur, how long they will last.  Third parties may dispute the Company's unpatented mining claims, which could result in the discovery of defective titles and losses affecting its business. The validity of unpatented mining claims, which constitute a significant portion of the Company's property holdings in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is 18made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company's mining claims could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. Coeur Rochester, Inc. (“Coeur Rochester”), the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, is party to a legal action relating to a third party's assertion of rights to unpatented mining claims at and near the Rochester property in Nevada. Coeur Rochester held 541 U.S. Federal unpatented claims through August 2011. On September 1, 2011, the Company inadvertently missed a claims fee payment to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) and as a result the prior unpatented mining claims were forfeited. The Company re-staked 516 claims in early December 2011 and August 2012 and filed notices with Pershing County, Nevada and the BLM. The new claims cover the majority of the prior unpatented claim area. A third party asserts that it also staked and filed notices on the Company's original unpatented mining claims and over subsequent new claims that had been previously staked by the Company. The Company believes it holds a superior property interest to the adverse staking party and filed a lawsuit to quiet title in the claims. The mine operates under an approved BLM plan of operations and has continued normal operations while the legal action is pending. The Company believes there will be no effect on the current silver and gold reserves at Coeur Rochester as a result of the claims dispute. However, the Company does believe an adverse outcome would require it to modify existing plans to further expand future mining operations and would require permits to be updated to reflect changes in claim ownership. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company's mines that, if successful, could impair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates. The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of the Company's existing shareholders' equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without shareholder approval, 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected"
5,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2012-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  The following sets forth certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or operating results. References to Coeur, in these riskfactors refer to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company does not presently know or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. The Companys results of operations and cash flows are highly dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold, which arevolatile and beyond its control.  Silver and gold are commodities, and their prices are volatile.During 2011, the price of silver ranged from a low of $26.77 per ounce to a high of $48.55 per ounce, and the price of gold ranged from a low of $1,319 per ounce to a high of $1,895 per ounce. The market prices of silver and gold onFebruary 22, 2012 were $34.15 per ounce and $1,752 per ounce, respectively.  Silver and gold prices areaffected by many factors beyond the Companys control, including prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal ofprecious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and smallinvestors to buy and sell precious metals, have become significant holders of gold and silver. Net inflows of investments into and out of ETFs have amplified the historical volatility of gold and silver prices. Because Coeur derives all of its revenues from sales of silver and gold, the Companys results of operations and cashflows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals increase or decrease. A sustained period of declining gold and silver prices would materially and adversely affect the Companys results of operations and cash flows. Factors that are generallyunderstood to contribute to a decline in the prices of silver and gold include a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net outflows from gold and silver ETFs, bullion sales by private and government holders and a general global economic slowdown. A substantial decline in gold and silver prices could cause one or more of the Companys mining properties tobecome unprofitable, which could require it to record write-downs of long-lived assets that would adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition. Established accounting standards for impairment of the value of long-lived assets such as mining properties requires Coeurto review the recoverability of the cost of its assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an assets carrying value to itsfair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. A significant and sustained decline in silver or gold prices, or the Companys failure to control production costs or realize the minable ore reservesat its mining properties, could lead the Company to terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties and require it to write down the carrying value of the Companys assets. Any such actions would negatively affectCoeurs results of operations and financial condition.  The Company also may record other types ofadditional mining property charges in the future if it sells a property for a price less than its carrying value or if it has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any such additionalwrite-downs of mining properties could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and financial condition.   12 Table of ContentsCoeur is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks in thecountries in which it has significant operations or interests.  A majority of the Companysrevenues are generated by operations outside the United States, and the Company is subject to significant risks inherent in resource extraction by foreign companies and contracts with government owned entities. Exploration, development, productionand closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Companys control. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced re-negotiation of contracts;unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations; royalty and tax increases, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas inwhich Coeurs operations are conducted. The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities. In addition, theCompanys rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups. Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significantcosts to meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, which could materially and adversely affect Coeurs results of operations, cash flows andfinancial condition.  The Companys operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operationalrisks.  Coeurs operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operationalrisks. Local economic conditions can cause the Company to experience shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in thearea of some of the Companys foreign operations could adversely affect Coeurs ability to operate in an optimal fashion, and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to property security. These conditions could lead to lowerproductivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.  Coeur sellsgold and silver doré in U.S. dollars, but conducts the Companys operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could adversely affect results of operations. Silver and gold mining involves significant production and operational risks. Silver and gold mining involves significant production and operational risks, including those related to uncertain mineralexploration success, unexpected geological or mining conditions, the difficulty of development of new deposits, unfavorable climate conditions, equipment or service failures, current unavailability of or delays in installing and commissioning plantsand equipment, import or customs delays and other general operating risks. Commencement of mining can reveal mineralization or geologic formations, including higher than expected content of other minerals that can be difficult to separate fromsilver, which can result in unexpectedly low recovery rates.  Problems also may arise due to the quality orfailure of locally obtained equipment or interruptions to services (such as power, water, fuel or transport or processing capacity) or technical support, which could result in the failure to achieve expected target dates for exploration, or couldcause production activities to require greater capital expenditure to achieve expected recoveries.  Many ofthese production and operational risks are beyond the Companys control. Delays in commencing successful mining activities at new or expanded mines, disruptions in production and low recovery rates could have adverse effects on results ofoperations, cash flows and financial condition.  The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjectivefactors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized in actual production. The Companys operating results and financial position may be negatively affected by inaccurate estimates. The ore reserve figures presented in the Companys public filings are estimates made by Coeurs technicalpersonnel and by independent mining consultants contracted by Coeur. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs,  13 Table of Contentsrecoveries and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and ofengineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market prices of silver or goldmay render reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired.Should Coeur encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, the Company may adjust its reserve estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affectactual production and results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  Forward sales and royalty arrangementscan result in limiting the Companys ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices.  The Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it has agreed to make royalty or similar payments to lenders in amounts that are based on expectedproduction and price levels for gold or silver. Coeur enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide the Company with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property on favorable terms. Royalty or similar paymentobligations, however, can limit the Companys ability to realize the full effects of rising gold or silver prices and require Coeur to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels. Coeurs future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet its debt payment obligations. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had a total of approximately $380.0 million of outstandingindebtedness, which includes $231.5 million for future estimated gold production royalty payments due to Franco-Nevada Corporation and Capital lease obligations of $28.6 million. The liabilities associated with such royalty payments increase as theprice of gold increases. Coeurs ability to make scheduled debt payments on its outstanding indebtedness will depend on its future results of operations and cash flows. Coeurs results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject toeconomic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of silver and gold. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet its obligations and commitments. If the Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow fromoperations to service its debt, the Company may need to further refinance its debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds. The Company cannot predict whether it will be able to refinance its debt, issue equity or dispose ofassets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms.  The Companys future growth will depend upon itsability to develop new mines, either through exploration at its existing properties or by acquisition from other mining companies.  Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, an important element of the Companys business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines,properties and businesses or interests therein. During 2011, Coeur successfully constructed a new leach pad at its Rochester mine and substantially completed development of its other major mining properties at Palmarejo, San Bartolomé, andKensington. The Companys ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon its success in further developing Coeurs existing properties and developing or acquiring new mining properties. Bothstrategies are inherently risky, and the Company cannot assure that it would be able to successfully compete in either the development of its existing or new mining properties or acquisitions of additional mining properties. While it is Coeurs practice to engage independent mining consultants to assist in evaluating and makingacquisitions, any mining properties or interests that the Company may acquire may not be developed profitably. If profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions,  14 Table of Contentsthe Company may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. Coeur cannot predict theimpact of future acquisitions on the price of its business or its common stock or that it would be able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities inconnection with such acquisitions, may adversely affect the price of the Companys common stock and negatively affect its results of operations.  Mineral exploration and development inherently involves significant and irreducible financial risks. Coeur may suffer from the failure to find and develop profitable mines. The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant financial risks that even a combination ofcareful evaluation, experience and knowledge cannot eliminate. Unprofitable efforts may result from the failure to discover mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return aprofit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of newproperties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic feasibility of any development project is based upon, among other things, volatile metals prices, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructuresand other resources such as water and power, metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs. Development projects also are subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessarypermits and receipt of adequate financing.  The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed,depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting ofminerals; environmental protection; and mineral prices. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or otherinterference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return oninvested capital.  Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with the Companysexploration, development and mining activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect Coeurs business. Coeurs ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration anddevelopment of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. The economic feasibility of any development project is based upon,among other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs of such development projects,and metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing. Development projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capitalrequirements. Development project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other samplingtechniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore,comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors.  As a result, actualcash operating costs and economic returns of any and all development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Companys financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.  15 Table of ContentsCoeur might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to meet capital needs,conduct its business, make payments when due or refinance its debt.  Coeur might need to raiseadditional funds in order to meet capital needs, implement its business plan, refinance its debt or acquire complementary businesses or products. Any required additional financing might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, holders of the Companys common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holdersof the Companys common stock.  A significant delay or disruption in the Companys sales of concentrates as aresult of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by its smelter customers could have a material adverse effect on the Companys operations.  The Company currently markets its silver and gold concentrates to third-party smelters and refineries in Mexico, Germany, China and Australia. The loss of any one smelter could have a material adverseeffect on the Company if alternative smelters and refineries were unavailable. The Company cannot assure you that alternative smelters or refineries would be available if the need for them were to arise, or that the Company would not experiencedelays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.  Coeurs silverand gold production may decline in the future, reducing its results of operations and cash flows.  TheCompanys silver and gold production, unless the Company is able to develop or acquire new properties, will decline over time due to the exhaustion of reserves and the possible closure of mines in response to declining metals prices or otherfactors. Identifying promising mining properties is difficult and speculative. Coeur encounters strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing silver and gold. Manyof these companies have greater financial resources than the Company does. Consequently, Coeur may be unable to replace and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms that areconsidered acceptable. As a result, Coeurs revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth. The Company cannot assure you that it would be able to replace the production that would be lostdue to the exhaustion of reserves and the possible closure of mines.  There are significant hazards associated with theCompanys mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.  The miningbusiness is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement orhazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs,monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is notgenerally available to the Company or to other companies in the industry. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operation, cash flows and financial condition. The Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act,and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.  Mining activities are subject toextensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety lawsand regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of currentlaws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.   16 Table of ContentsU.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington and Rochester minesare frequently inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, the Company has undergone inspections and received numerous citations and orders as aresult of the inspections.  Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements mayresult in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment orremedial actions. In addition, any of our U.S. mines could be subject to a temporary or extended shut down as a result of a violation alleged by the MSHA. Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or development of mineralproperties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Any such penalties,fines, sanctions or shutdowns could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures. Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water qualitystandards and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement,increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incurenvironmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require the Company to suspend operations or enter into interim compliancemeasures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that Coeur has made for such remediation. Thepotential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior andcurrent operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediationcosts, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Companys operations. Coeur cannot assure you that any such law,regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a negative effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  Some of the Companys mining wastes currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations governing hazardous wasteunder the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). If the EPA designates these wastes as hazardous under RCRA, Coeur would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expendituresto construct hazardous waste disposal facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a mining facility, that facility could be designated as a Superfund site under theComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Under CERCLA, any owner or operator of a Superfund site since the time of its contamination may be held liable and may be forced to undertake extensiveremedial cleanup action or to pay for the governments cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations orrequirements also are imposed on the Companys tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA. Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada andAlaska. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory proposals related to climate   17 Table of Contentschange, including legislation pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption of these proposals could have a materially adverse effect on theCompanys results of operations and cash flows.  The Companys ability to obtain necessary government permitsto expand operations or begin new operations can be materially affected by third party activists. Private parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuaderegulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings andcostly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays of the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. An environmental organization has brought an administrative appeal challenging the Bureau of Land Managementsapproval of a plan of amendment which allows active mining to be resumed and a new heap leach pad to be constructed at the Rochester property. The Interior Board of Land Appeals is expected to rule on the appeal in 2012. The Company cannot predictthe outcome of the appeal or what effect, if any, an adverse ruling may have on current operations. If an adverse ruling is issued, the Company may be required to update the permitting for the current operations at Rochester. Coeurs operations in Bolivia are subject to political risks. The Bolivian government adopted a new constitution in early 2009 that strengthened state control over key economic sectorssuch as mining. In connection with the 2009 constitution, the government of Bolivia announced a restructuring of the mining law. A commission was established in March 2011 to finalize the mining law updates and the commissions evaluationremains ongoing. The Company has been assessing the potential effects of the proposed legislation on its Bolivian operations but any effects remain uncertain until the law is enacted. The law is expected to regulate taxation and royalties and toprovide for contracting with the government rather than concession holding. The revised mining law is expected to be enacted in 2012. The Company cannot assure that its operations at the San Bartolomé mine will not be affected in thecurrent political environment in Bolivia.  On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned miningorganization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of 4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mineabove this elevation under valid contracts backed by Supreme Decree with COMIBOL as well as contracts with local mining cooperatives that hold their rights through COMIBOL. The Company temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activitiesto the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. In March 2010, the San Bartolomé mine began mining operations above the 4,400 meter level in high grade materiallocated in the Huacajchi deposit, which was confirmed to be excluded from the October 2009 resolution, under an agreement with the Cooperative Reserva Fiscal. In December 2011, a further area in the deposit, known as Huacajchi Sur, was furtherconfirmed to be open for mining as well. Other mining areas above the 4,400 meter level continue to be suspended. The mine plan adjustment may reduce production until the Company is able to resume mining above 4,400 meters generally. It is uncertainat this time how long the temporary suspension will remain in place. If the restriction is not lifted, the Company may need to write down the carrying value of the asset. It is also unknown if any new mining or investment policies or shifts inpolitical attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.  The Companys business depends on good relations with itsemployees.  The Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions inproduction that could adversely affect the Company. As of December 31, 2011, unions represented approximately 14% of Coeurs worldwide workforce. The Company has a collective bargaining agreement covering the Martha mine which expires onJune 30, 2012. Additionally, the Company has a labor agreement at its San Bartolomé mine which became effective October 11, 2007, and does not have a fixed term.   18 Table of ContentsThird parties may dispute the Companys unpatented mining claims, which couldresult in the discovery of defective titles and losses affecting Coeurs business.  The validityof unpatented mining claims, which constitute a significant portion of Coeurs property holdings in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undevelopedproperties, in accordance with mining industry practice the Company does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective.Defective title to any of Coeurs mining claims could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole.  Coeur Rochester is party to a legal action relating to a third partys assertion of rights to unpatented mining claims at and near the Rochester property in Nevada. Coeur Rochester held 541 U.S.Federal unpatented claims through August 2011. On September 1, 2011, the Company inadvertently missed a claims fee payment to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and as a result the prior unpatented mining claimswere forfeited. The Company re-staked 479 claims in early December 2011 and filed notices with Pershing County, Nevada and the BLM. The new claims cover the majority of the prior unpatented claim area. A third party asserts that italso staked and filed notices on the Companys original unpatented mining claims. The Company believes it holds a superior property interest to the adverse staking party and filed a lawsuit to quiet title in the claims. The mine operates underan approved BLM plan of operations and has continued normal operations while the legal action is pending. The Company believes there would be no effect on the current silver and gold reserves at Coeur Rochester assuming an adverseoutcome. However, the Company does believe an adverse outcome would require it to modify existing plans to further expand future mining operations and would require permits to be updated to reflect changes in claim ownership. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Companys mines that, if successful, couldimpair development and operations. A defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates. The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding commonstock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock.  The issuance ofadditional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of the Companys existing shareholders equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without shareholder approval,10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other specialrights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices,liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of the Companys common stock. Coeurs Board of Directors has no present intention of issuing any preferred stock, but reserves the right to do so in the future andhas reserved for issuance a series of preferred stock in connection with its shareholder rights plan. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected.  "
7,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2011-03-01,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     The following sets forth information relating to important risks    and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the    Companys business, financial condition or operating    results. References to Coeur, in these risk factors    refer to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that    the Company does not presently know or that the Company    currently deem immaterial may also impair its business    operations. The    Companys results of operations and cash flows are highly    dependent upon the market prices of silver and gold, which are    volatile and beyond its control.     Silver and gold are commodities, and their prices are volatile.    During 2010, the price of silver ranged from a low of $14.78 per    ounce to a high of $30.64 per ounce, and the price of gold    ranged from a low of $1,058 per ounce to a high of $1,421 per    ounce. The market prices of silver and gold on February 25,    2011 were $32.95 per ounce and $1,402.50 per ounce,    respectively.     Silver and gold prices are affected by many factors beyond the    Companys control, including prevailing interest rates and    returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding    inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental decisions    regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and    regional demand and production, political and economic    conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds    (ETFs), which have substantially facilitated the    ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious    metals, recently,    12     have become significant holders of gold and silver. Net inflows    of investments into and out of ETFs are amplifying the    historical volatility of gold and silver prices.     Because Coeur derives all of its revenues from sales of silver    and gold, the Companys results of operations and cash    flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals increase or    decrease. A sustained period of declining gold and silver prices    would materially and adversely affect the Companys results    of operations and cash flows. Factors that are generally    understood to contribute to a decline in the prices of silver    and gold include a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, net    outflows from gold and silver ETFs, bullion sales by private and    government holders and a general global economic slowdown. A    substantial decline in gold and silver prices could cause one or    more of the Companys mining properties to become    unprofitable, which could require it to record write-downs of    long-lived assets that would adversely impact the Companys    results of operations and financial condition.     Established accounting standards for impairment of the value of    long-lived assets such as mining properties requires Coeur to    review the recoverability of the cost of its assets by    estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result    from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment,    measured by comparing an assets carrying value to its fair    value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset    exceeds these cash flows. A significant and sustained decline in    silver or gold prices, or the Companys failure to control    production costs or realize the minable ore reserves at its    mining properties, could lead the Company to terminate or    suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties and    require it to write down the carrying value of the    Companys assets. Any such actions would negatively affect    Coeurs results of operations and financial condition.     The Company also may record other types of additional mining    property charges in the future if it sells a property for a    price less than its carrying value or if it has to increase    reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and    reclamation of a property. Any such additional write-downs of    mining properties could adversely affect the Companys    results of operations and financial condition. Coeur    is an international company and is exposed to political and    social risks in the countries in which it has significant    operations or interests.     The Company has significant mining operations outside the United    States and is subject to significant risks inherent in resource    extraction by foreign companies and contracts with government    owned entities. Exploration, development, production and closure    activities in many countries are potentially subject to    heightened political and social risks that are beyond the    Companys control. These risks include the possible    unilateral cancellation or forced re-negotiation of contracts;    unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations; royalty and    tax increases, claims by governmental entities or indigenous    communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and    other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in    which Coeurs operations are conducted. The right to export    silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses and    quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of    the relevant regulatory authorities. In addition, the    Companys rights under local law may not be as secure in    countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation    and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental    organizations and civic groups.     Any of these developments could require the Company to curtail    or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to    meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater    royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize    higher taxes, which could materially and adversely affect    Coeurs results of operations, cash flows and financial    condition. The    Companys operations outside the United States also expose    it to economic and operational risks.     Coeurs operations outside the United States also expose it    to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions can    cause the Company to experience shortages of skilled workers and    supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of    operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity    and violence in the area of some of the Companys foreign    operations could adversely affect Coeurs ability to    operate in an optimal fashion, and may impose greater risks of    theft and greater risks as to property security. These    conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs,    which would adversely affect results of operations and cash    flows.    13     Coeur sells gold and silver doré in U.S. dollars, but    conducts the Companys operations outside the United States    in local currency. Currency exchange movements could adversely    affect results of operations. Silver    and gold mining involves significant production and operational    risks.     Silver and gold mining involves significant production and    operational risks, including those related to uncertain mineral    exploration success, unexpected geological or mining conditions,    the difficulty of development of new deposits, unfavorable    climate conditions, equipment or service failures, current    unavailability of or delays in installing and commissioning    plants and equipment, import or customs delays and other general    operating risks. Commencement of mining can reveal    mineralization or geologic formations, including higher than    expected content of other minerals that can be difficult to    separate from silver, which can result in unexpectedly low    recovery rates.     Problems may also arise due to the quality or failure of locally    obtained equipment or interruptions to services (such as power,    water, fuel or transport or processing capacity) or technical    support, which could result in the failure to achieve expected    target dates for exploration, or could cause production    activities to require greater capital expenditure to achieve    expected recoveries.     Many of these production and operational risks are beyond the    Companys control. Delays in commencing successful mining    activities at new or expanded mines, disruptions in production    and low recovery rates could have adverse effects on results of    operations, cash flows and financial condition. The    estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon    subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized    in actual production. The Companys operating results may    be negatively affected by inaccurate estimates.     The ore reserve figures presented in the Companys public    filings are estimates made by Coeurs technical personnel    and by independent mining consultants contracted by Coeur.    Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering    analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about    production costs, recoveries and silver and gold market prices.    Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The    accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of    available data and of engineering and geological interpretation,    judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold    market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices    have fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market    prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing    relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and the    Company may be required to reduce reserve estimates, discontinue    development or mining at one or more of its properties or write    down assets as impaired. Should Coeur encounter mineralization    or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different    from those predicted, the Company may adjust its reserve    estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these    alternatives may adversely affect actual production and results    of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Forward    sales and royalty arrangements can result in limiting the    Companys ability to take advantage of increased metal    prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal    prices.     From time to time the Company has entered into financing    arrangements under which it has agreed to make royalty or    similar payments to lenders in amounts that are based on    expected production and price levels for gold or silver. Coeur    enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they    provide the Company with necessary capital to develop a specific    mining property on favorable terms. The impact of royalty or    similar payment obligations, however, can limit the    Companys ability to realize the full effect of rising gold    or silver prices and require Coeur to make potentially    significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified    minimum levels. Coeurs    future operating performance may not generate cash flows    sufficient to meet its debt payment obligations.     As of December 31, 2010, the Company had a total of    approximately $435.7 million of outstanding indebtedness,    which includes $242.3 million for gold production royalty    payments due to Franco-Nevada Corporation for royalty covering    50% of the life of mine gold to be produced from the Palmarejo    silver and gold mine in Mexico. Coeurs ability to make    scheduled debt payments on its outstanding indebtedness will    depend on its future    14     results of operations and cash flows. Coeurs results of    operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic    factors beyond its control, including the market prices of    silver and gold. The Company may not be able to generate enough    cash flow to meet its obligations and commitments. If the    Company cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to    service its debt, the Company may need to further refinance its    debt, dispose of assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary    funds. The Company cannot predict whether it will be able to    refinance its debt, issue equity or dispose of assets to raise    funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. The    Companys future growth will depend upon its ability to    develop new mines, either through exploration at its existing    properties or by acquisition from other mining    companies.     Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable    ore reserves, an important element of the Companys    business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver and    gold mines, properties and businesses or interests therein.    During 2010, Coeur successfully commenced operations at its    Kensington gold mine and substantially completed development of    its other major mining properties at Palmarejo and    San Bartolomé. The Companys ability to achieve    significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will    depend upon its success in further developing Coeurs    existing properties and developing or acquiring new mining    properties. Both strategies are inherently risky, and the    Company cannot assure you that it would be able to successfully    compete in either the development of its existing or new mining    properties or acquisitions of additional mining properties.     While it is Coeurs practice to engage independent mining    consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any    mining properties or interests that the Company may acquire may    not be developed profitably. If profitable when acquired, that    profitability might not be sustained. In connection with any    future acquisitions, the Company may incur indebtedness or issue    equity securities, resulting in increased interest expense, or    dilution of the percentage ownership of existing shareholders.    Coeur cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the    price of its business or its common stock or that it would be    able to obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms.    Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or    issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions,    may adversely affect the price of the Companys common    stock and negatively affect its results of operations. Coeur    might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to meet    capital needs, conduct its business, make payments when due or    refinance its debt.     Coeur might need to raise additional funds in order to meet    capital needs, implement its business plan, refinance its debt    or acquire complementary businesses or products. Any required    additional financing might not be available on commercially    reasonable terms, or at all. If the Company raises additional    funds by issuing equity securities, holders of the    Companys common stock could experience significant    dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could    have rights senior to those of the holders of the Companys    common stock. Mineral    exploration and development inherently involves significant and    irreducible financial risks. Coeur may suffer from the failure    to find and develop profitable mines.     The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves    significant financial risks that even a combination of careful    evaluation, experience and knowledge cannot eliminate.    Unprofitable efforts may result from the failure to discover    mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, those    deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a    profit from production, or it may take a number of years until    production is possible, during which time the economic viability    of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are    ultimately developed into producing mines.     Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves,    to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties,    to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic    feasibility of any development project is based upon, among    other things, volatile metals prices, estimates of the size and    grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other    resources such as water and power, metallurgical recoveries,    production rates and capital and operating costs. Development    projects also are subject to the completion of favorable    feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary    permits and receipt of adequate financing.    15     The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed,    depends on a number of factors, including: the particular    attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to    infrastructure; government regulations including taxes,    royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of    minerals; environmental protection; and mineral prices. Factors    that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of    roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or    infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other    interference in the maintenance or provision of such    infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The    exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted,    but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate    return on invested capital. Significant    investment risks and operational costs are associated with the    Companys exploration, development and mining activities.    These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and    may adversely affect Coeurs business.     Coeurs ability to sustain or increase its present    production levels depends in part on successful exploration and    development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining    operations. Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and    gold, involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. The    economic feasibility of any development project is based upon,    among other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore    reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such    as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates    and capital and operating costs of such development projects,    and metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the    completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and    maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate    financing.     Development projects may have no operating history upon which to    base estimates of future operating costs and capital    requirements. Development project items such as estimates of    reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a    large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data,    obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling    techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating    costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades    of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore    body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable    facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and    other factors.     As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of    any and all development projects may materially differ from the    costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Companys    financial condition and results of operations may be negatively    affected. A    significant delay or disruption in the Companys sales of    concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of    purchases by its smelter customers could have a material adverse    effect on the Companys operations.     The Company currently markets its silver and gold doré and    concentrates to third-party smelters and refineries in Mexico,    Switzerland, China, the United States and Australia. The loss of    any one smelter or refinery customer could have a material    adverse effect on the Company if alternative smelters and    refineries were unavailable. The Company cannot assure you that    alternative smelters or refineries would be available if the    need for them were to arise, or that the Company would not    experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially    and adversely affect results of operations. Coeurs    silver and gold production may decline in the future, reducing    its results of operations and cash flows.     The Companys silver and gold production, unless the    Company is able to develop or acquire new properties, will    decline over time due to the exhaustion of reserves and the    possible closure of mines in response to declining metals prices    or other factors. Identifying promising mining properties is    difficult and speculative. Coeur encounters strong competition    from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition    of properties producing or capable of producing silver and gold.    Many of these companies have greater financial resources than    the Company does. Consequently, Coeur may be unable to replace    and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new    mining properties or interests therein on terms that are    considered acceptable. As a result,    16     Coeurs revenues from the sale of silver and gold may    decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth. The    Company cannot assure you that it would be able to replace the    production that would be lost due to the exhaustion of reserves    and the possible closure of mines. There    are significant hazards associated with the Companys    mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by    insurance.     The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including    environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of    unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding,    earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or    hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in    damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production    facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage,    reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs,    monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully    covering many environmental risks, including potential liability    for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste    products occurring from exploration and production, is not    generally available to the Company or to other companies in the    industry. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these    risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely    affect results of operation, cash flows and financial condition. The    Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, and    related costs and delays may negatively affect its    business.     Mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local    and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental    protection, natural resources, prospecting, development,    production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and    occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including    mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs    associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are    substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more    restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by    governmental authorities, could cause additional expense,    capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of    operations and delays in the development of new properties.     Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and    permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions,    including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities    causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may require    corrective measures including capital expenditures, installation    of additional equipment or remedial actions. Parties engaged in    mining operations or in the exploration or development of    mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering    loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may be    subject to civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for    violations of applicable laws or regulations. Compliance    with environmental regulations and litigation based on    environmental regulations could require significant    expenditures.     Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the    maintenance of air and water quality standards and land    reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation,    transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous    waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that    will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines    and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental    assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of    responsibility for mining companies and their officers,    directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental    costs that could have a material adverse effect on its financial    condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an    environmental problem could require the Company to suspend    operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending    completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards    that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of    remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that Coeur    has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be    significant and could have a material adverse effect on the    Companys financial condition and results of operations.     Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring    lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons    resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of    prior and current operations, including operations conducted by    other mining companies many years ago at sites located on    properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These    lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines,    remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal    sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for    restoring the    17     environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the    Companys operations. Coeur cannot assure you that any such    law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a    negative effect on results of operations, cash flows or    financial condition.     Some of the Companys mining wastes currently are exempt to    a limited extent from the extensive set of federal Environmental    Protection Agency (EPA) regulations governing    hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act    (RCRA). If the EPA designates these wastes as    hazardous under RCRA, Coeur would be required to expend    additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make    significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposal    facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes    contamination in or damage to the environment at a mining    facility, that facility could be designated as a    Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).    Under CERCLA, any owner or operator of a Superfund site since    the time of its contamination may be held liable and may be    forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay    for the governments cleanup efforts. The owner or operator    also may be liable to governmental entities for the cost of    damages to natural resources, which could be substantial.    Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the    Companys tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under    the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and in Nevada    under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements    the CWA.     Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution    statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada and Alaska. In    addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory    proposals related to climate change, including legislation    pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in    greenhouse gas emissions. Adoption of these proposals could have    a materially adverse effect on the Companys results of    operations and cash flows. The    Companys ability to obtain necessary government permits to    expand operations or begin new operations can be materially    affected by third party activists.     Private parties such as environmental activists frequently    attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade    regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits    that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental    permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving    numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and    costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially    increase the costs and cause delays of the permitting process    and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development    or expansion of a mine. Coeurs    operations in Bolivia are subject to political    risks.     The Bolivian government adopted a new constitution in early 2009    that strengthened state control over key economic sectors such    as mining. The Company cannot assure you that its operations at    the San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia will not be affected    in the current political environment in Bolivia. On    October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining    organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was    temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of    4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro    Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine    above this elevation under valid contracts backed by Supreme    Decree with COMIBOL as well as contracts with local mining    cooperatives that hold their rights through COMIBOL. The Company    temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine mining activities    to the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and    timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. In    March 2010, the San Bartolomé mine began mining    operations in high grade material located in the Huacajchi    deposit above the 4,400 meter level under an agreement with the    Cooperative Reserva Fiscal. Although restriction on mining above    the 4,400 meter level continue, the Huacajchi deposit was    confirmed to be excluded from the October 2009 resolution. The    mine plan adjustment may reduce production until the Company is    able to resume mining above 4,400 meters generally. It is    uncertain at this time how long the temporary suspension will    remain in place. If the restriction is not lifted, the Company    may need to write down the carrying value of the asset. It is    also unknown if any new mining or investment policies or shifts    in political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.    18 The    Companys business depends on good relations with its    employees.     The Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or    other disruptions in production that could adversely affect the    Company. As of December 31, 2010, unions represented    approximately 17% of Coeurs worldwide workforce. The    collective bargaining agreement covering the Martha mine expires    on June 30, 2011. Additionally, the Company has a labor    agreement at its San Bartolomé mine which became    effective October 11, 2007, and does not have a fixed term. Third    parties may dispute the Companys unpatented mining claims,    which could result in the discovery of defective titles and    losses affecting Coeurs business.     The validity of unpatented mining claims, which constitute a    significant portion of Coeurs property holdings in the    United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Although    the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to    undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry    practice the Company does not generally obtain title opinions    until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result,    some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may    be defective. Defective title to any of Coeurs mining    claims could result in litigation, insurance claims and    potential losses affecting its business as a whole.     There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims    comprising the Palmarejo mine that, if successful, could impair    development and operations. A defect could result in the Company    losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest    in and to the properties to which the title defect relates. The    Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities,    which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding    common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price    of its common stock.     The issuance of additional equity securities or securities    convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of    the Companys existing shareholders equity ownership.    The Company is authorized to issue, without shareholder    approval, 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or    more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in    each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and    relative participating, optional, conversion and other special    rights of the shares of each series as well as the    qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any    series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights,    conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption,    redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights    superior to the rights of holders of the Companys common    stock. Coeurs Board of Directors has no present intention    of issuing any preferred stock, but reserves the right to do so    in the future and has reserved for issuance a series of    preferred stock in connection with its shareholder rights plan.    If the Company issued additional equity securities, the price of    its common stock may be materially and adversely affected. "
8,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2010-02-26,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     The following sets forth information relating to important risks    and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect the    Companys business, financial condition or operating    results. References to we, our and    us in these risk factors refer to the Company.    Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know    or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our    business operations. The    market prices of silver and gold are volatile. Low silver and    gold prices could result in decreased revenues, decreased net    income or losses and decreased cash flows, and may negatively    affect our business.     Silver and gold are commodities. Their prices fluctuate, and are    affected by many factors beyond our control, including interest    rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency    values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of    precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and    production, political and economic conditions and other factors.    Because we currently derive approximately 79% of our revenues    from continuing operations from sales of silver and 21% from    gold, our earnings are primarily related to the price of these    metals.     The market prices of silver (Handy & Harman) and gold    (London Final) on February 23, 2010 were $15.92 per ounce    and $1,107 per ounce, respectively. The prices of silver and    gold may decline in the future. Factors that are generally    understood to contribute to a decline in the price of silver    include sales by private and government holders, and a general    global economic slowdown.    12Table of Contents    If the prices of silver and gold are depressed for a sustained    period and our net losses continue, we may be forced to suspend    mining at one or more of our properties until the prices    increase, and to record additional asset impairment write-downs.    Any lost revenues, continued or increased net losses or    additional asset impairment    write-downs    would adversely affect our financial condition and results of    operations. We    have significant demands on our liquidity.     We have incurred significant capital expenditures in recent    years to acquire and develop new mining properties. Our ability    to complete the funding of these properties depends to a    significant extent on both our operating performance, which in    turn depends on our production of silver and gold and the price    of silver and gold, as well as on our ability to raise funds    through the sale of debt and equity securities. The current    global financial crisis has increased our cost of funds and may    impede our ability to raise any additional funds that could be    required in the future. There can be no assurances that such    funds will be available upon acceptable terms, or at all, when    or if needed. We may    have to record write-downs of long-lived assets, which could    negatively impact our results of operations.     Established accounting standards for impairment of the value of    long-lived assets such as mining properties requires a company    to review the recoverability of the cost of its assets by    estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result    from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment,    measured by comparing an assets carrying value to its fair    value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset    exceeds these cash flows, and recognizing impairment write-downs    could negatively impact our financial condition and results of    operations.     If silver or gold prices decline or we fail to control    production costs or realize the minable ore reserves at our    mining properties, we may be required to recognize asset    write-downs. We also may record other types of additional mining    property charges in the future to the extent a property is sold    by us for a price less than the carrying value of the property,    or if reclamation liabilities have to be increased in connection    with the closure and reclamation of a property. Additional    write-downs of mining properties could negatively impact our    financial condition and results of operations.     Due to declining ore reserve at the Martha mine, the Company    expects operating activities to cease in late 2010 unless    additional mineralization is discovered during the year. In    addition, the Company has placed the Cerro Bayo mine under a    care and maintenance plan, while undertaking efforts to further    explore its holdings and develop a new mine plan and ore    reserves in an effort to re-commence operations. The Company is    also pursuing strategic alternatives for our Cerro Bayo and    Martha mines which may result in the assets (asset groups) being    sold or otherwise substantially disposed of before the end of    their previously estimated useful lives.     On October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining    organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was    temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of    4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro    Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine    above this elevation under valid contracts backed by Supreme    Decree with COMIBOL as well as contracts with local mining    cooperatives who hold their rights through COMIBOL. The Company    temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine its activities to    ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level and has advised    COMIBOL that the restriction must be lifted timely. It is    uncertain at this time how long the temporary suspension will    remain in place.     The Company determined that these factors were triggering events    in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in    the United States, (U.S. GAAP), requiring the Company to    assess whether the long-lived assets at these mines were    impaired. The impairment assessment compared the cumulative    undiscounted prospective cash flows of each mine to the sum of    the carrying values of the long-lived assets at    San Bartolomé, Cerro Bayo and Martha mines as of    December 31, 2009.     In projecting its future cash flows, the Company considered    certain assumptions for silver and gold prices (including    current and historical prices, analyst consensus forward prices,    as well as the trailing three-year average silver and gold    market prices) and production levels, expected and historical    operating costs and required capital    13Table of Contents    expenditures based on available life of mine plans. Assumptions    underlying future cash flows are subject to significant risk and    uncertainty associated with any differences between specific    assumptions and market conditions, such as silver and gold    prices, lower than expected recoverable ounces    and/or the    Companys operating performance. Based on the    Companys assessment, there were no required impairments at    the San Bartolomé, Cerro Bayo and the Martha mines as    of December 31, 2009. Should silver prices fall below    consensus forward for historical prices, should cash costs per    ounce exceed those projected and historically achieved or should    facts and circumstances regarding mining restrictions above the    4,400 level at the San Bartolomé mine adversely    change, the Company may need to record an impairment loss and    that loss could have a material adverse affect on the    Companys operations and financial position. Our    future operating performance may not generate cash flows    sufficient to meet our debt payment obligations.     As of December 31, 2009, we had a total of approximately    $363.6 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to    make scheduled debt payments on our outstanding indebtedness    will depend on our future operating performance and cash flow.    Our operating performance and cash flow, in part, are subject to    economic factors beyond our control, including the market prices    of silver and gold. We may not be able to generate enough cash    flow to meet our obligations and commitments. If we cannot    generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our    debt, we may need to further refinance our debt, dispose of    assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds. We cannot    predict whether we will be able to refinance our debt, issue    equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or    on satisfactory terms. We    might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to    complete capital needs, conduct our business, make payments when    due or refinance our debt.     We might need to raise additional funds in order to meet capital    needs, implement our business plan, refinance our debt or    acquire complementary businesses or products. Any required    additional financing might not be available on commercially    reasonable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by    issuing equity securities, holders of our common stock could    experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and    these securities could have rights senior to those of the    holders of our common stock. We are    an international company and are exposed to risks in the    countries in which we have significant operations or interests.    Foreign instability or variances in foreign currencies may cause    unforeseen losses, which may affect our business.     Exploration, development, production and closure activities    outside of North America are potentially subject to heightened    political and economic risks, including (i) cancellation or    re-negotiation of contracts; (ii) disadvantages of    competing against companies from countries that are not subject    to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act; (iii) changes in foreign laws and    regulations; (iv) royalty and tax increases or claims by    governmental entities or indigenous communities, including    retroactive claims; (v) expropriation or nationalization of    property; (vi) currency fluctuations; and (vii) other    risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our    operations are conducted including risks inherent in contracts    with government owned entities.     Consequently, our exploration, development and production    activities outside of North America may be substantially    affected by factors beyond our control, some of which could    materially adversely affect our financial position, results of    operations and liquidity. Furthermore, if a dispute arises from    such activities, we may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction    of courts outside North America, which could adversely affect    the outcome of a dispute. Our    revenues and income (or loss) from our interest in the Endeavor    mine are dependent in part upon the performance of the operators    of the mine.     In May 2005, we acquired silver production and reserves at the    Endeavor mine in Australia. This mine is owned and operated by    another mining company. The Companys revenues and income    (or loss) from its interest in the silver production at this    mine is dependent in part upon the performance of the operators    of this mine as well as    14Table of Contents    upon zinc and lead prices that are sufficient to maintain    sustainable operations. The decline in primary metal prices may    result in cessation of mining operations at Endeavor and an    impairment would likely occur. The    estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon    subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized    in actual production. Our operating results may be negatively    affected by inaccurate estimates.     The ore reserve figures presented in our public filings are    estimates made by our technical personnel. Reserve estimates are    a function of geological and engineering analyses that require    us to make assumptions about production costs and silver and    gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and    subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function    of the quality of available data and of engineering and    geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions    about silver and gold market prices are subject to great    uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past.    Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render    reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to    exploit, and we may be required to reduce reserve estimates,    discontinue development or mining at one or more of our    properties, or write down assets as impaired. Should we    encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our    mines or projects different from those we predicted, we may    adjust our reserve estimates and alter our mining plans. Either    of these alternatives may adversely affect our actual production    and operating results.     We based our ore reserve determinations as of December 31,    2009 on a long-term silver price average of $14.50 per ounce,    with the exceptions of San Bartolomé which used $13.25,    Martha at $16.00 and the Endeavor mine at $12.00 per ounce of    silver, and a long-term gold price average of $850 per ounce for    all properties with the exceptions of Kensington which uses    $750, and the Martha Mine at $950. On February 23, 2010    silver and gold prices were $15.92 per ounce and $1,107 per    ounce, respectively. The    estimation of the ultimate recovery of metals contained within    the Rochester heap leach pad inventory is inherently inaccurate    and subjective and requires the use of estimation techniques.    Actual recoveries can be expected to vary from    estimations.     The Rochester mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract    silver and gold from ore. The heap leach process is a process of    extracting silver and gold by placing ore on an impermeable pad    and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion    of the contained silver and gold, which are then recovered in    metallurgical processes.     We use several integrated steps in the process of extracting    silver and gold to estimate the metal content of ore placed on    the leach pads. Although we refine our estimates as appropriate    at each step in the process, the final amounts are not    determined until a third-party smelter converts the doré    and determines final ounces of silver and gold available for    sale. We then review this end result and reconcile it to the    estimates we developed and used throughout the production    process. Based on this review, we adjust our estimation    procedures when appropriate. As a result, actual recoveries can    vary from estimates, and the amount of the variation could be    significant and could have a material adverse impact on our    financial condition and results of operations. Our    estimates of current and non-current inventories may not be    realized in actual production and operating results, which may    negatively affect our business.     We use estimates, based on prior production results and    experiences, to determine whether heap leach inventories will be    recovered more than one year in the future, and is non-current    inventory, or will be recovered within one year, and is current    inventory. The estimates involve assumptions that may not prove    to be consistent with our actual production and operating    results. We cannot determine the amount ultimately recoverable    until leaching is completed. If our estimates prove inaccurate,    our current and long-term operating results may be less than    anticipated.    15Table of ContentsSilver    mining involves significant production and operational risks.    Coeur may suffer from the failure to efficiently operate its    mining projects.     Silver mining involves significant degrees of risk, including    those related to mineral exploration success, unexpected    geological or mining conditions, the development of new    deposits, climatic conditions, equipment    and/or    service failures, compliance with current or new governmental    requirements, current availability of or delays in installing    and commissioning plant and equipment, import or customs delays    and other general operating risks. Problems may also arise due    to the quality or failure of locally obtained equipment or    interruptions to services (such as power, water, fuel or    transport or processing capacity) or technical support, which    results in the failure to achieve expected target dates for    exploration or production activities    and/or    result in a requirement for greater expenditure. The right to    export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses    and quotas, the granting of which may be at the discretion of    the relevant regulatory authorities. There may be delays in    obtaining such licenses and quotas, leading to our results of    operations being adversely affected, and it is possible that    from time to time export licenses may be refused. Many of these    risks are outside of the ability of Coeurs management to    control and may result in a materially adverse effect on    Coeurs operations, financial position and cash flows. Mineral    exploration and development inherently involves significant and    irreducible financial risks. Coeur may suffer from the failure    to find and develop profitable mines.     The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves    significant financial risks, which even a combination of careful    evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate.    Unprofitable efforts may result from the failure to discover    mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, such    deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a    profit from production, or it may take a number of years until    production is possible, during which time the economic viability    of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are    ultimately developed into producing mines. Mining companies rely    on consultants and others for exploration, development,    construction and operating expertise.     Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves,    extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to    construct mining and processing facilities. The economic    feasibility of any development project is based upon, among    other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves,    proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water    and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and    capital and operating costs of such development projects, and    metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the    completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and    maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate    financing.     Once a mineral deposit is developed, whether it will be    commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including:    the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade    and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations    including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use, importing    and exporting of minerals and environmental protection; and    mineral prices. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure    include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water    supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and    government or other interference in the maintenance or provision    of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly    cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately    predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an    adequate return on invested capital. Significant    investment risks and operational costs are associated with our    exploration, development and mining activities. These risks and    costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely    affect our business.     Our ability to sustain or increase our present production levels    depends in part on successful exploration and development of new    ore bodies    and/or    expansion of existing mining operations. Mineral exploration,    particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is    frequently unproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may    take a number of years until production is possible, during    which time the economic viability of the project may change.    Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves,    extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to    construct mining and processing facilities. The economic    feasibility of any development project is based upon, among    other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves,    proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water    and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and    capital and operating costs    16Table of Contents    of such development projects, and metals prices. Development    projects are also subject to the completion of favorable    feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary    permits and receipt of adequate financing.     Development projects may have no operating history upon which to    base estimates of future operating costs and capital    requirements. Development project items such as estimates of    reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a    large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data,    obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling    techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating    costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades    of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore    body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable    facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and    other factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and    economic returns of any and all development projects may    materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and    accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations    may be negatively affected. The    Companys marketing of metals and concentrates could be    adversely affected if there were to be a significant delay or    purchases by its third-party smelter and refinery customers. In    particular, a significant delay or disruption in our sales of    concentrates as a result of the unexpected discontinuation of    purchases by our smelter customers could have a material adverse    effect on our operations.     The Company currently markets and refines its silver and gold    doré and concentrates to third-party smelters and    refineries in Mexico, Switzerland, United States and Australia.    The loss of any one smelter    and/or    refinery customer could have a material adverse effect on us in    the event of the possible unavailability of alternative smelters    and refineries. No assurance can be given that alternative    smelters or refineries would be timely available if the need for    them were to arise, or that delays or disruptions in sales could    not be experienced that would result in a materially adverse    effect on our operations and our financial results. Our    silver and gold production may decline, reducing our revenues    and negatively impacting our business.     Our future silver and gold production may decline as a result of    an exhaustion of reserves and possible closure of mines. It is    our business strategy to conduct silver and gold exploratory    activities at our existing mining and exploratory properties as    well as at new exploratory projects, and to acquire silver and    gold mining properties and businesses or reserves that possess    minable ore reserves and are expected to become operational in    the near future. We can provide no assurance that our silver and    gold production in the future will not decline. Accordingly, our    revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline,    negatively affecting our results of operations. There    are significant hazards associated with our mining activities,    some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. To the    extent we must pay the costs associated with such risks, our    business may be negatively affected.     The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including    environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of    unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding,    earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or    hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in    damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production    facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage,    reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs,    monetary losses and possible legal liability. Insurance fully    covering many environmental risks (including potential liability    for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste    products occurring from exploration and production) is not    generally available to us or to other companies in the industry.    Although we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider to    be adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which    event we could incur significant costs that could adversely    affect our financial condition, results of operation and    liquidity. We are    subject to significant governmental regulations, and their    related costs and delays may negatively affect our    business.     Coeurs mining activities are subject to extensive federal,    state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing    environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting,    development, production, post-closure    17Table of Contents    reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and    safety laws and regulations including mine safety, toxic    substances and other matters related to Coeurs business.    The costs associated with compliance with such laws and    regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and    regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws    and regulations by governmental authorities could cause    additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or    suspensions of Coeurs operations and delays in the    development of its properties. Moreover, future developments in    U.S. federal laws and regulations are currently especially    difficult to predict due to the new President and Congress in    2009. Changes in the federal government may increase the    likelihood that mining companies generally will be subject to    new laws, regulations and regulatory investigations.     In addition, government approvals, approval of aboriginal people    and permits are currently and may in the future be required in    connection with our operations at San Bartolomé and    Palmarejo. To the extent such approvals are required and not    obtained, Coeur may be curtailed or prohibited from operating at    San Bartolomé or Palmarejo.     Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and    permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions    thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial    authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may    include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures,    installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions.    Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or    development of mineral properties may be required to compensate    those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining    activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties    imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Compliance    with environmental regulations and litigation based on    environmental regulations could require significant    expenditures.     Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the    maintenance of air and water quality standards and land    reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation,    transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous    waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which    will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines    and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental    assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of    responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and    employees.     To the extent Coeur is subject to environmental liabilities, the    payment of such liabilities or the costs that it may incur to    remedy environmental pollution would reduce funds otherwise    available to it and could have a material adverse effect on our    financial condition and results of operations. If Coeur is    unable to fully remedy an environmental problem, it might be    required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance    measures pending completion of the required remedy. The    environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at a mine    site impact the cost of remediation and may exceed the financial    accruals that have been made for such remediation. The potential    exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse    effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring    lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons    resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of    Coeurs past and current operations, which could lead to    the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs,    penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial    costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment    after the closure of mines, are inherent in Coeurs    operations. Although Coeur believes that it is in substantial    compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Coeur cannot    assure you that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private    claim will not have a negative effect on its business, financial    condition or results of operations.     Some of Coeurs mining wastes are currently exempt to a    limited extent from the extensive set of federal Environmental    Protection Agency (EPA) regulations governing    hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act    (RCRA). If the EPA designates these wastes as    hazardous under RCRA, Coeur would be required to expend    additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make    significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposal    facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes    contamination in or damage to the environment at a mining    facility, such facility may be designated as a    Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).    Under CERCLA, any owner or operator of a Superfund site since    the time of its contamination may be held liable and may be    forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay    for the governments cleanup efforts. Such owner or    operator    18Table of Contents    may also be liable to governmental entities for the cost of    damages to natural resources, which may be substantial.    Additional regulations or requirements are also imposed upon    Coeurs tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under    the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and in Nevada    under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements    the CWA. The Company considers the current proposed federal    legislation relating to climate change and its potential    enactment may have future impacts to the Companys    operations in the United States or abroad through international    accords.     Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution    statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada and Alaska. In    addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory    proposals related to climate change, including legislation    pending in the U.S. Congress to require reductions in    greenhouse gas emissions. The Company has reviewed and    considered current federal legislation relating to climate    change and does not believe it to have a material effect on its    operations, however, additional regulation or requirements under    any of these laws and regulations could have a materially    adverse effect upon the Company and its results of operations.     Compliance with CERCLA, the CWA and state environmental laws    could entail significant costs, which could have a material    adverse effect on Coeurs operations.     In the context of environmental permits, including the approval    of reclamation plans, Coeur must comply with standards and    regulations which entail significant costs and can entail    significant delays. Such costs and delays could have a dramatic    impact on Coeurs operations. There is no assurance that    future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not    adversely affect Coeurs operations. Coeur intends to fully    comply with all applicable environmental regulations. We are    required to obtain government permits to expand operations or    begin new operations. The acquisition of such permits can be    materially impacted by third party litigation seeking to prevent    the issuance of such permits. The costs and delays associated    with such approvals could affect our operations, reduce our    revenues, and negatively affect our business as a    whole.     Mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for    expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new    operations. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a    complex and time-consuming process involving numerous    jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly    undertakings. The duration and success of permitting efforts are    contingent on many factors that are out of our control. The    governmental approval process may increase costs and cause    delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted,    and could cause us to not proceed with the development of a    mine. Accordingly, this approval process could harm our results    of operations. Our    operations in Bolivia are subject to political    risks.     The Bolivian government adopted a new constitution in early 2009    that strengthened state control over key economic sectors such    as mining. We cannot assure you that our operations at the    San Bartolomé mine in Bolivia will not be affected in    the current political environment in Bolivia. On    October 14, 2009, the Bolivian state-owned mining    organization, COMIBOL, announced by resolution that it was    temporarily suspending mining activities above the elevation of    4,400 meters above sea level while stability studies of Cerro    Rico mountain are undertaken. The Company holds rights to mine    above this elevation under valid contracts backed by Supreme    Decree with COMIBOL as well as contracts with local mining    cooperatives who hold their rights through COMIBOL. The Company    temporarily adjusted its mine plan to confine its activities to    the ore deposits below 4,400 meters above sea level. The Company    timely notified COMIBOL of the need to lift the restriction. The    mine plan adjustment may reduce the 2010 production by as much    as 500,000 ounces of silver per quarter until the Company is    able to resume mining above 4,400 meters. The Company is also    reviewing its mine plan and may modify its manpower and    operations schedule to minimize any financial impact of this    potential production shortfall. It is uncertain at this time how    long the temporary suspension will remain in place. It is also    unknown if any new mining or investment policies or shifts in    political attitude may affect mining in Bolivia.    19Table of ContentsOur    business depends on good relations with our    employees.     The Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or    other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us.    As of December 31, 2009, unions represented approximately    19% of our worldwide workforce. On that date, the Company had    7 employees at its Cerro Bayo mine and 57 employees at    its Martha mine who were working under a collective bargaining    agreement. The agreement covering the Cerro Bayo mine expires on    December 21, 2010 and a collective bargaining agreement    covering the Martha mine expires on June 1, 2010.    Additionally, the Company had 176 employees at its    San Bartolomé mine working under a labor agreement    which became effective October 11, 2007, and does not have    a fixed term. Coeur    is exposed to risks with respect to the legal systems in the    countries in which it has significant operations or interests    and resolutions of any disputes may adversely affect its    business.     Some of the jurisdictions in which Coeur currently and may in    the future operate have less developed legal systems than would    be found in more established economies like the United States.    This may result in risks such as potential difficulties in    obtaining effective legal redress in the courts of such    jurisdictions, whether in respect of a breach of law or    regulation, or in an ownership dispute; a higher degree of    discretion on the part of governmental authorities; the lack of    judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable    rules and regulations; inconsistencies or conflicts between and    within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders and    resolutions; or relative inexperience of the judiciary and    courts in such matters.     In certain jurisdictions the commitment of local business    people, government officials and agencies and the judicial    system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements    may be uncertain, creating particular concerns with respect to    licenses and agreements for business. These may be susceptible    to revision or cancellation and legal redress may be uncertain    or delayed. There can be no assurance that joint ventures,    licenses, license applications or other legal arrangements will    not be adversely affected by the actions of government    authorities or others, and the effectiveness of and enforcement    of such arrangements in these jurisdictions cannot be assured. Any of our future acquisitions may result in significant    risks, which may adversely affect our business.     An important element of our business strategy is the    opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines, properties    and businesses or interests therein. While it is our practice to    engage independent mining consultants to assist in evaluating    and making acquisitions, any mining properties or interests    therein we may acquire may not be developed profitably or, if    profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be    sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions, we may    incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in    increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage    ownership of existing shareholders. We cannot predict the impact    of future acquisitions on the price of our business or our    common stock. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional    indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such    acquisitions, may impact the price of our common stock and    negatively affect our results of operations. Coeur    is continuously considering possible acquisitions of additional    mining properties or interests therein that are located in other    countries, and could be exposed to significant risks associated    with any such acquisitions.     In the ordinary course of Coeurs business, Coeur is    continuously considering the possible acquisition of additional    significant mining properties or interests therein that may be    located in countries other than those in which Coeur now has    operations or interests. Consequently, in addition to the risks    inherent in the valuation and acquisition of such mining    properties, as well as the subsequent development, operation or    ownership thereof, Coeur could be subject to additional risks in    such countries as a result of governmental policies, economic    instability, currency value fluctuations and other risks    associated with the development, operation or ownership of    mining properties or interests therein. Such risks could    adversely affect Coeurs results of operations.    20Table of ContentsOur    ability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain.    Accordingly, our prospects are uncertain for the future growth    of our business.     Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable    ore reserves, we are continually seeking to replace and expand    our ore reserves. Identifying promising mining properties is    difficult and speculative. Furthermore, we encounter strong    competition from other mining companies in connection with the    acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing    silver and gold. Many of these companies have greater financial    resources than we do. Consequently, we may be unable to replace    and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new    mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider    acceptable. As a result, our revenues from the sale of silver    and gold may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced    growth. Third    parties may dispute our unpatented mining claims, which could    result in the discovery of defective titles and losses affecting    our business.     The validity of unpatented mining claims, which constitute a    significant portion of Coeurs property holdings in the    United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Although    Coeur has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped    properties, Coeur, in accordance with mining industry practice,    does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is    made to develop a property. As a result, some titles,    particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective.    Defective title to any of Coeurs mining claims could    result in litigation, insurance claims, and potential losses    affecting its business as a whole.     The acquisition of title to concessions and similar property    interests is a detailed and time consuming process. Title to,    and the area of, concessions and similar property interests may    be disputed.     There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims    comprising Palmarejo that, if successful, could impair    development    and/or    operations. A defect could result in Coeur losing all or a    portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the    properties to which the title defect relates. Also, while Coeur    believes that the registration defects relating to certain    non-material properties as described herein will be remedied;    there can be no assurance as to timing or successful completion. The    market price of our common stock has been volatile and may    decline.     The market price of our common stock has been volatile and may    decline in the future. The market price of our common stock    historically has fluctuated widely and been affected by our    operating results and by many factors beyond our control. These    factors include: market prices of silver and gold; general stock    market conditions; interest rates; expectations regarding    inflation; currency values; and global and regional political    and economic conditions and other factors. We    have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which    would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common    stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our    common stock.     The issuance of additional equity securities or securities    convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of    existing shareholders equity interests in the Company. We    are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval,    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series    to establish the number of shares to be included in each series    and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative    participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of    the shares of each series as well as the qualification,    limitations or restrictions on each series, including but not    limited to the fixing or alteration of the dividend rights,    dividend rate or rates, conversion rights, voting rights, rights    and terms of redemption, the redemption price or prices and the    liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of shares    of preferred stock, or any or all of them. Any series of    preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion    rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices,    liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights    of holders of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has no    present intention of issuing any preferred stock, but reserves    the right to do so in the future and has reserved for issuance a    series of preferred stock in connection with our shareholder    rights plan. If we issue additional equity securities, the price    of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.    21Table of ContentsWe are    subject to anti-takeover provisions in our charter and in our    bylaws that could delay or prevent an acquisition of Coeur even    if such an acquisition would be beneficial to our    shareholders.     Certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and our    bylaws could provide the ability to delay or prevent a third    party from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to    our shareholders. Some of these provisions: (i) authorize    the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued    by the Board of Directors without prior shareholder approval,    commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock,    with rights senior to those of common stock; (ii) authorize    the Board of Directors to increase or decrease the size of the    board without shareholder approval; (iii) authorize a    majority of the directors then in office to fill any vacancy on    the Board of Directors; and (iv) require that a fair    price be paid in some business transactions. "
10,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2009-03-02,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     The following information sets forth information relating to    important risks and uncertainties that could materially    adversely affect the Companys business, financial    condition or operating results. References to we,    our and us in these risk factors refer    to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do    not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also    impair our business operations. The    worldwide economic downturn and difficult conditions in the    global capital and credit markets have affected and may continue    to adversely affect our business, as well as the industries of    our customers. We do not expect these conditions to improve in    the near future.     Recent declines in consumer and business confidence and    spending, together with severe reductions in the availability    and cost of credit, and volatility in the capital and credit    markets, have adversely affected the business and economic    environment in which we operate and the profitability of our    business. Our business is exposed to risks associated with the    creditworthiness of our key suppliers, customers and business    partners. These conditions have resulted and may continue to    result in financial instability or other adverse effects at any    of our suppliers, customers or business partners. The    consequences of such adverse effects could include the    interruption of production at the facilities of our customers,    the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays    in or the inability of customers to obtain financing to purchase    from us, and bankruptcy of customers or other creditors. Any of    these events may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability    and financial condition. Similarly, any of these events may    affect our business partners financial condition, such as    those companies that operate mines where we own silver    production and reserves, and the negative impact on our business    partners could adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and    financial condition.     Moreover, the current worldwide financial crisis has reduced the    availability of liquidity and credit to fund or support the    continuation and expansion of business operations worldwide.    Many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in    some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers. Continued    disruption of the credit markets has affected and could continue    to adversely affect our customers access to credit, which    supports the continuation and expansion of their businesses    worldwide and could result in contract cancellations or    suspensions, payment delays or defaults by our customers. The    market prices of silver and gold are volatile. If we experience    low silver and gold prices it may result in decreased revenues,    decreased net income or losses and decreased cash flows, and may    negatively affect our business.     Silver and gold are commodities. Their prices fluctuate, and are    affected by many factors beyond our control, including interest    rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency    values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of    precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and    production, political and economic conditions and other factors.    Because we currently derive approximately 69% of our revenues    from continuing operations from sales of silver, our earnings    and cash flows are primarily related to the price of this metal.    Sustained weakness in the price of silver could have a material    adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.     The market prices of silver (Handy & Harman) and gold    (London Final) on February 26, 2009 were $13.12 and $937    per ounce, respectively. The prices of silver and gold may    decline in the future. Factors that are generally understood to    contribute to a decline in the price of silver include sales by    private and government holders, and a general global economic    slowdown.     Coeur may also suffer from declines in mineral prices. Since    1999, Coeur has not engaged in any silver hedging activities and    is currently not engaged in any gold hedging activities.    Accordingly, Coeur has no protection from declines in mineral    prices or currency fluctuations.    11Table of Contents    If the prices of silver and gold are depressed for a sustained    period and our net losses resume, we may be forced to suspend    mining at one or more of our properties until the prices    increase, and to record additional asset impairment write-downs.    Any lost revenues, continued or increased net losses or    additional asset impairment write-downs would adversely affect    our results of operations. We    have significant demands on our liquidity.     We have incurred significant capital expenditures in recent    years to acquire and develop additional producing properties,    during which time our revenues have decreased and operating    costs have increased. In addition, the Company plans to invest    approximately $130 million in capital activities in 2009 to    complete construction of Palmarejo and for sustaining capital    investments at our existing operations. This excludes capital    expenditures at Kensington, which will be updated after the    U.S. Supreme Court decision. Our ability to fund these    operations depends to a significant extent on both our operating    performance, which in turn depends on our production of silver    and gold and the price of silver and gold, as well as on our    ability to raise funds through the sale of debt and equity    securities. The current global financial crisis has increased    our cost of funds and may impede our ability to raise any funds    that could be required in the future. We may    have to record write-downs of long-lived assets, which could    negatively impact our results of operations.     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,    Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived    Assets (SFAS 144), established accounting    standards for impairment of the value of long-lived assets such    as mining properties. SFAS 144 requires a company to review    the recoverability of the cost of its assets by estimating the    future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use    and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by    comparing an assets carrying value to its fair value, must    be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these    cash flows, and recognizing impairment write-downs could    negatively impact our financial condition and results of    operations.     If silver or gold prices decline or we fail to control    production costs or realize the minable ore reserves at our    mining properties, we may be required to recognize asset    write-downs. We also may record other types of additional mining    property charges in the future to the extent a property is sold    by us for a price less than the carrying value of the property,    or if reclamation liabilities have to be increased in connection    with the closure and reclamation of a property. Additional    write-downs of mining properties could negatively impact our    financial condition and results of operations.     The Kensington property has been the subject of litigation    involving a permit required to complete construction of a    required tailings facility. Reference is made to the discussion    set forth in Item 3. Legal Proceedings     Federal Court (Alaska) Kensington Project Permit Challenge    for a detailed description of the Kensington project permit    legal challenge, including the possibility of an impairment    writedown in the event that the expectation of the long-term    price for gold decreases below approximately $750 per ounce.     No assurance can be given as to whether or when regulatory    permits and approvals granted to the Company may be further    challenged, appealed or contested by third parties or issuing    agencies, or as to whether the Company will ultimately place the    Kensington project into commercial production.     During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company temporarily    suspended operations at Cerro Bayo in order to conserve existing    reserves and focus on exploration and development of new    discoveries and existing veins. The Companys objective is    to recommence production at lower costs and higher production    rates in 2010.     The Company determined that the reduced production levels and    the increase in operating cost levels was a triggering event in    accordance with SFAS 144, requiring the Company to assess    whether the long-lived assets at the mine were impaired. Step    one of the impairment assessment compares the cumulative    undiscounted prospective cash flows of the mine to the sum of    the carrying values of the long-lived assets at Cerro Bayo.    Should the carrying values of the long-lived assets at the mine    exceed the sum of those undiscounted future cash flows, a    comparison of    12Table of Contents    the fair value of the asset to its book value is then required.    If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the assets,    an impairment loss would be recorded.     In projecting its future cash flows, the Company considers    certain assumptions for silver prices (including current and    historical prices, analyst consensus forward prices, as well as    the trailing three-year average silver market prices) and    production levels, expected and historical operating costs and    required capital expenditures based on available life of mine    plans. Assumptions underlying future cash flows are subject to    significant risk and uncertainty associated with any differences    between specific assumptions and market conditions, such as    silver and gold prices, lower than expected recoverable ounces    and/or the    Companys operating performance. Based on the    Companys assessment, there was not a required impairment    at December 31, 2008. Should silver prices fall below the    consensus forward or historical prices, should the cash costs    per ounce exceed those projected and historically achieved, or    should an updated reserve report result in a reduction of the    number of ounces recoverable at Cerro Bayo, the Company may be    required to record an impairment loss and that loss could have a    material adverse effect on the Companys operations and    financial position. Our    future operating performance may not generate cash flows    sufficient to meet our debt payment obligations.     As of December 31, 2008, we had a total of approximately    $462 million of outstanding indebtedness. Our ability to    make scheduled debt payments on our outstanding indebtedness    will depend on our future operating performance and cash flow.    Our operating performance and cash flow, in part, are subject to    economic factors beyond our control, including the market prices    of silver and gold. We may not be able to generate enough cash    flow to meet our obligations and commitments. If we cannot    generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our    debt, we may need to further refinance our debt, dispose of    assets or issue equity to obtain the necessary funds. We cannot    predict whether we will be able to refinance our debt, issue    equity or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or    on satisfactory terms. We    might be unable to raise additional financing necessary to    conduct our business, make payments when due or refinance our    debt.     We might need to raise additional funds in order to implement    our business plan, refinance our debt or acquire complementary    businesses or products. Any required additional financing might    not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If    we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, holders    of our common stock could experience significant dilution of    their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights    senior to those of the holders of our common stock. The    Palmarejo project is in the beginning stages of commercial    production and involves significant risks associated with the    commencement of commercial production.     There can be no assurance that significant losses will not occur    at the Palmarejo project in the near future or that the    Palmarejo project will be profitable in the future. Coeurs    operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase in    subsequent years as needed consultants, personnel and equipment    associated with advancing exploration, development and    commercial production of the Palmarejo project and any other    properties Coeur may acquire are added. The amounts and timing    of expenditures will depend on the progress of ongoing    exploration and development and the results of consultants    analyses and recommendations, which are beyond Coeurs    control. Our    revenues and income (or loss) from our interest in the Endeavor    and Broken Hill mines are dependent in part upon the performance    of the operators of the mine.     In May and September 2005, we acquired silver production and    reserves at the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines in Australia,    respectively. These mines are owned and operated by other mining    companies. The Companys revenues and income (or loss) from    its interest in the silver production at these mines are    dependent in part upon the performance of those operators and    such mines as well as upon zinc and lead prices that are    sufficient to maintain sustainable operations. The decline in    primary metal prices may result in cessation of mining    operations and an impairment would likely occur.    13Table of Contents    On August 21, 2008, the operator of the Broken Hill mine    advised the market that, following an extensive review of its    Broken Hill operations, it had implemented a plan to resize the    operation in light of current low metal prices. Under the    revised operating plan, ore production will decrease from 1.8 to    0.95 million tonnes per year. This reduction in ore    production could have an adverse effect on Coeurs revenues    and income at this mine. The    estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon    subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not be realized    in actual production. Our operating results may be negatively    affected by inaccurate estimates.     The ore reserve figures presented in our public filings are    estimates made by our technical personnel. Reserve estimates are    a function of geological and engineering analyses that require    us to make assumptions about production costs and silver and    gold market prices. Reserve estimation is an imprecise and    subjective process and the accuracy of such estimates is a    function of the quality of available data and of engineering and    geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions    about silver and gold market prices are subject to great    uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past.    Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render    reserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to    exploit, and we may be required to reduce reserve estimates,    discontinue development or mining at one or more of our    properties, or write down assets as impaired. Should we    encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of our    mines or projects different from those we predicted, we may    adjust our reserve estimates and alter our mining plans. Either    of these alternatives may adversely affect our actual production    and operating results.     We based our ore reserve determinations as of December 31,    2008 on a long-term silver price average of $13.25 per ounce,    with the exception of the Endeavor mine which uses $12.00 per    ounce and the Broken Hill mine which uses $2.22 per ounce of    silver, and a long-term gold price average of $750 per ounce for    all properties. On February 26, 2009 silver and gold prices    were $13.12 per ounce and $937 per ounce, respectively. The    estimation of the ultimate recovery of metals contained within    the Rochester heap leach pad inventory is inherently inaccurate    and subjective and requires the use of estimation techniques.    Actual recoveries can be expected to vary from    estimations.     The Rochester mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract    silver and gold from ore. The heap leach process is a process of    extracting silver and gold by placing ore on an impermeable pad    and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion    of the contained silver and gold, which are then recovered in    metallurgical processes.     We use several integrated steps in the process of extracting    silver and gold to estimate the metal content of ore placed on    the leach pads. Although we refine our estimates as appropriate    at each step in the process, the final amounts are not    determined until a    third-party    smelter converts the doré and determines final ounces of    silver and gold available for sale. We then review this end    result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and used    throughout the production process. Based on this review, we    adjust our estimation procedures when appropriate. As a result,    actual recoveries can vary from estimates, and the amount of the    variation could be significant and could have a material adverse    impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our    estimates of current and non-current inventories may not be    realized in actual production and operating results, which may    negatively affect our business.     We use estimates, based on prior production results and    experiences, to determine whether heap leach inventory will be    recovered more than one year in the future, and is non-current    inventory, or will be recovered within one year, and is current    inventory. The estimates involve assumptions that may not prove    to be consistent with our actual production and operating    results. We cannot determine the amount ultimately recoverable    until leaching is completed. If our estimates prove inaccurate,    our operating results may be less than anticipated.    14Table of ContentsSilver    mining involves significant production and operational risks.    Coeur may suffer from the failure to efficiently operate its    mining projects.     Silver mining involves significant degrees of risk, including    those related to mineral exploration success, unexpected    geological or mining conditions, the development of new    deposits, climatic conditions, equipment    and/or    service failures, compliance with current or new governmental    requirements, current availability of or delays in installing    and commissioning plant and equipment, import or customs delays    and other general operating risks. Problems may also arise due    to the quality or failure of locally obtained equipment or    interruptions to services (such as power, water, fuel or    transport or processing capacity) or technical support, which    results in the failure to achieve expected target dates for    exploration or production activities    and/or    result in a requirement for greater expenditure. The right to    export silver and gold may depend on obtaining certain licenses    and quotas, the granting of which may be at the discretion of    the relevant regulatory authorities. There may be delays in    obtaining such licenses and quotas leading to the financial    result of Coeur being adversely affected, and it is possible    that from time to time export licenses may be refused. Many of    these risks are outside of the ability of Coeurs    management to control and may result in a materially adverse    effect on Coeurs operations, financial position and cash    flows. Mineral    exploration and development inherently involves significant and    irreducible financial risks. Coeur may suffer from the failure    to find and develop profitable mines.     The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves    significant financial risks, which even a combination of careful    evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate.    Unprofitable efforts may result from the failure to discover    mineral deposits. Even if mineral deposits are found, such    deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a    profit from production, or it may take a number of years until    production is possible, during which time the economic viability    of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are    ultimately developed into producing mines. Mining companies rely    on consultants and others for exploration, development,    construction and operating expertise.     Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves,    extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to    construct mining and processing facilities. The economic    feasibility of any development project is based upon, among    other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves,    proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water    and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and    capital and operating costs of such development projects, and    metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the    completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance and    maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate    financing.     Once a mineral deposit is developed, whether it will be    commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including:    the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade    and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations    including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use, importing    and exporting of minerals and environmental protection; and    mineral prices. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure    include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water    supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and    government or other interference in the maintenance or provision    of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly    cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately    predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an    adequate return on invested capital. Significant    investment risks and operational costs are associated with our    exploration, development and mining activities. These risks and    costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely    affect our business.     Our ability to sustain or increase our present production levels    depends in part on successful exploration and development of new    ore bodies    and/or    expansion of existing mining operations. Mineral exploration,    particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is    frequently unproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may    take a number of years until production is possible, during    which time the economic viability of the project may change.    Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves,    extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to    construct mining and processing facilities. The economic    feasibility of any development project is based upon, among    other things, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves,    proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water    and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates and    capital and operating costs    15Table of Contents    of such development projects, and metals prices. Development    projects are also subject to the completion of favorable    feasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary    permits and receipt of adequate financing.     Development projects may have no operating history upon which to    base estimates of future operating costs and capital    requirements. Development project items such as estimates of    reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a    large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data    obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling    techniques and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operating    costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades    of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the    orebody, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore,    comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate    conditions and other factors. As a result, actual cash operating    costs and economic returns of any and all development projects    may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and    accordingly, our business results of operations may be    negatively affected. The    Companys marketing of metals concentrates could be    adversely affected if there were to be a significant delay or    disruption of purchases by its    third-party    smelter customers. In particular, a significant delay or    disruption in our sales of concentrates as a result of the    unexpected discontinuation of purchases by our smelter customers    could have a material adverse effect on our    operations.     The Company currently markets its silver and gold concentrates    to    third-party    smelters in Mexico, Japan and Australia. The loss of any one    smelter customer could have a material adverse effect on us in    the event of the possible unavailability of alternative    smelters. No assurance can be given that alternative smelters    would be timely available if the need for them were to arise, or    that delays or disruptions in sales could not be experienced    that would result in a materially adverse effect on our    operations and our financial results. Our    silver and gold production may decline, reducing our revenues    and negatively impacting our business.     Our future silver and gold production may decline as a result of    an exhaustion of reserves and possible closure of mines. It is    our business strategy to conduct silver and gold exploratory    activities at our existing mining and exploratory properties as    well as at new exploratory projects, and to acquire silver and    gold mining properties and businesses or reserves that possess    minable ore reserves and are expected to become operational in    the near future. We can provide no assurance that our silver and    gold production in the future will not decline. Accordingly, our    revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline,    negatively affecting our results of operations. There    are significant hazards associated with our mining activities,    some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. To the    extent we must pay the costs associated with such risks, our    business may be negatively affected.     The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including    environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of    unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding,    earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or    hazardous weather conditions. These occurrences could result in    damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production    facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage,    reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs,    monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although we    maintain insurance in an amount that we consider to be adequate,    liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which event we could    incur significant costs that could adversely affect our results    of operation. Insurance fully covering many environmental risks    (including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as    a result of disposal of waste products occurring from    exploration and production) is not generally available to us or    to other companies in the industry. The realization of any    significant liabilities in connection with our mining activities    as described above could negatively affect our results of    operations. We are    subject to significant governmental regulations, and their    related costs and delays may negatively affect our    business.     Coeurs mining activities are subject to extensive federal,    state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing    environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting,    development, production, post-closure    16Table of Contents    reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and    safety laws and regulations including mine safety, toxic    substances and other matters related to Coeurs business.    Although these laws and regulations have never required Coeur to    close any mine, the costs associated with compliance with such    laws and regulations are substantial. Possible future laws and    regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws    and regulations by governmental authorities could cause    additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or    suspensions of Coeurs operations and delays in the    development of its properties. Moreover, future developments in    U.S. federal laws and regulations are currently especially    difficult to predict due to the new President and Congress.    These changes in the federal government may increase the    likelihood that we will be subject to new laws, regulations and    regulatory investigations.     In addition, government approvals, approval of aboriginal people    and permits are currently and may in the future be required in    connection with the Palmarejo project. To the extent such    approvals are required and not obtained, Coeur may be curtailed    or prohibited from planned mining operations or continuing its    planned exploration or development of mineral properties at the    Palmarejo project.     Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and    permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions    thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial    authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may    include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures,    installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions.    Parties engaged in mining operations or in the exploration or    development of mineral properties may be required to compensate    those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining    activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties    imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Compliance    with environmental regulations and litigation based on    environmental regulations could require significant    expenditures.     Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the    maintenance of air and water quality standards and land    reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation,    transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous    waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that    will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines    and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental    assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of    responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and    employees.     To the extent Coeur is subject to environmental liabilities, the    payment of such liabilities or the costs that it may incur to    remedy environmental pollution would reduce funds otherwise    available to it and could have a material adverse effect on the    combined company. If Coeur is unable to fully remedy an    environmental problem, it might be required to suspend    operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending    completion of the required remedy. The potential exposure may be    significant and could have a material adverse effect.     Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring    lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons    resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of    Coeurs past and current operations, which could lead to    the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs,    penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial    costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment    after the closure of mines, are inherent in Coeurs    operations. Although Coeur believes that it is in substantial    compliance with applicable laws and regulations, Coeur cannot    assure you that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private    claim will not have a negative effect on its business, financial    condition or results of operations.     Some of Coeurs mining wastes are currently exempt to a    limited extent from the extensive set of federal Environmental    Protection Agency (EPA) regulations governing    hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act    (RCRA). If the EPA designates these wastes as    hazardous under RCRA, Coeur would be required to expend    additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make    significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposal    facilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes    contamination in or damage to the environment at a mining    facility, such facility may be designated as a    Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental    Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).    Under CERCLA, any owner or operator of a Superfund site since    the time of its contamination may be held liable and may be    forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay    for the governments cleanup efforts. Such owner or    operator may also be liable to governmental entities for the    cost of damages to natural resources, which may be substantial.    17Table of Contents    Additional regulations or requirements are also imposed upon    Coeurs tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under    the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and in Nevada    under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements    the CWA. Airborne emissions are subject to controls under air    pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada and    Alaska. Compliance with CERCLA, the CWA and state environmental    laws could entail significant costs, which could have a material    adverse effect on Coeurs operations.     In the context of environmental permits, including the approval    of reclamation plans, Coeur must comply with standards and    regulations which entail significant costs and can entail    significant delays. Such costs and delays could have a dramatic    impact on Coeurs operations. There is no assurance that    future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not    adversely affect Coeurs operations. Coeur intends to fully    comply with all applicable environmental regulations. We are    required to obtain government permits to expand operations or    begin new operations. The acquisition of such permits can be    materially impacted by third-party litigation seeking to prevent    the issuance of such permits. The costs and delays associated    with such approvals could affect our operations, reduce our    revenues and negatively affect our business as a    whole.     Mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for    expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new    operations such as the Kensington development project and the    Palmarejo project. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits    is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous    jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly    undertakings. The duration and success of permitting efforts are    contingent on many factors that are out of our control. The    governmental approval process may increase costs and cause    delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted,    and could cause us to not proceed with the development of a    mine. Accordingly, this approval process could harm our results    of operations.     Reference is made to the discussion of the current litigation    regarding the validity of the mine tailings permit at the    Kensington property in Alaska that is set forth under the above    risk factor entitled We may have to record write-downs of    long-lived assets, which could negatively impact our results of    operations. Our    business depends on good relations with our    employees.     The Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or    other disruptions in production that could adversely affect us.    As of December 31, 2008, unions represented approximately    27.5% of our worldwide workforce. On that date, the Company had    13 employees at its Cerro Bayo mine and 137 employees    at its Martha mine who were working under a collective    bargaining agreement. The agreement covering the Cerro Bayo mine    expires on December 21, 2010, and a collective bargaining    agreement covering the Martha mine expires on June 1, 2010.    Additionally, the Company had 134 employees at its    San Bartolomé mine working under a labor agreement    which became effective October 11, 2007 and does not have a    fixed term. We are    an international company and are exposed to risks in the    countries in which we have significant operations or interests.    Foreign instability or variances in foreign currencies may cause    unforeseen losses, which may affect our business.     Any foreign operation or investment is subject to political and    economic risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties    may include exchange controls; extreme fluctuations in currency    exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labor unrest; civil    unrest; military repression; expropriation and nationalization;    renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions,    licenses, permits and contracts; illegal mining; changes in    taxation policies; restrictions on foreign exchange and    repatriation; and laws or policies in the U.S. affecting    foreign trade investment and taxation. Further, foreign    operations or investment is subject to changes in government    regulations with respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on    production, price controls, export controls, currency    remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreign    investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation,    land use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety.     Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Mexico and Australia are the most    significant foreign countries in which Coeur now directly or    indirectly owns or operates mining properties or developmental    projects. Coeur also conducts exploratory projects in these    countries. Argentina and Bolivia, while currently economically    and politically stable, have    18Table of Contents    experienced political instability, provincial government    pressures on mining operations, currency value fluctuations and    changes in banking regulations in recent years. It is uncertain    at this time how new mining or investment policies or shifts in    political attitude may affect mining in these countries.     Coeur may enter into agreements which require Coeur to purchase    currencies of foreign countries in which Coeur does business in    order to ensure fixed exchange rates. In the event that actual    exchange rates vary from those set forth in any such hedge    contracts, Coeur will experience U.S. dollar-denominated    currency gains or losses. Continued worldwide economic    volatility, future political instabilities or changes in the    laws of foreign countries in which Coeur has significant    operations or interests and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign    currency exchange rates could negatively impact its foreign    operations and its business as a whole. Further, property    ownership in a foreign country is generally subject to the risk    of expropriation or nationalization with inadequate compensation. Coeur    is exposed to risks with respect to the legal systems in the    countries in which it has significant operations or interests    and resolutions of any disputes may adversely affect its    business.     Some of the jurisdictions in which Coeur currently and may in    the future operate have less developed legal systems than would    be found in more established economies like the United States.    This may result in risks such as potential difficulties in    obtaining effective legal redress in the courts of such    jurisdictions, whether in respect of a breach of law or    regulation, or in an ownership dispute; a higher degree of    discretion on the part of governmental authorities; the lack of    judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable    rules and regulations; inconsistencies or conflicts between and    within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders and    resolutions; or relative inexperience of the judiciary and    courts in such matters.     In certain jurisdictions the commitment of local business    people, government officials and agencies and the judicial    system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements    may be uncertain, creating particular concerns with respect to    licenses and agreements for business. These may be susceptible    to revision or cancellation and legal redress may be uncertain    or delayed. There can be no assurance that joint ventures,    licenses, license applications or other legal arrangements will    not be adversely affected by the actions of government    authorities or others, and the effectiveness of and enforcement    of such arrangements in these jurisdictions cannot be assured. Any of    our future acquisitions may result in significant risks, which    may adversely affect our business.     An important element of our business strategy is the    opportunistic acquisition of silver and gold mines, properties    and businesses or interests therein. While it is our practice to    engage independent mining consultants to assist in evaluating    and making acquisitions, any mining properties or interests    therein we may acquire may not be developed profitably or, if    profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be    sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions, we may    incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in    increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage    ownership of existing shareholders. We intend to seek    shareholder approval for any such acquisitions to the extent    required by applicable law, regulations or stock exchange rules.    We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price    of our business or our common stock. Unprofitable acquisitions,    or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in    connection with such acquisitions, may impact the price of our    common stock and negatively affect our results of operations. Coeur    is continuously considering possible acquisitions of additional    mining properties or interests therein that are located in other    countries, and could be exposed to significant risks associated    with any such acquisitions.     In the ordinary course of Coeurs business, Coeur is    continuously considering the possible acquisition of additional    significant mining properties or interests therein that may be    located in countries other than those in which Coeur now has    operations or interests. Consequently, in addition to the risks    inherent in the valuation and acquisition of such mining    properties, as well as the subsequent development, operation or    ownership thereof, Coeur could be subject to additional risks in    such countries as a result of governmental policies, economic    instability, currency value fluctuations and other risks    associated with the development, operation or ownership of    mining properties or interests therein. Such risks could    adversely affect Coeurs results of operations.    19Table of ContentsOur    ability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain.    Accordingly, our prospects are uncertain for the future growth    of our business.     Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable    ore reserves, we are continually seeking to replace and expand    our ore reserves. Identifying promising mining properties is    difficult and speculative. Furthermore, we encounter strong    competition from other mining companies in connection with the    acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing    silver and gold. Many of these companies have greater financial    resources than we do. Consequently, we may be unable to replace    and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new    mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider    acceptable. As a result, our revenues from the sale of silver    and gold may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced    growth. Third    parties may dispute our unpatented mining claims, which could    result in the discovery of defective titles and losses affecting    our business.     The validity of unpatented mining claims, which constitute a    significant portion of Coeurs property holdings in the    United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Although    Coeur has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped    properties, Coeur, in accordance with mining industry practice,    does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is    made to develop a property. As a result, some titles,    particularly titles to undeveloped properties, may be defective.    Defective title to any of Coeurs mining claims could    result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses    affecting its business as a whole.     The acquisition of title to concessions and similar property    interests is a detailed and time consuming process. Title to,    and the area of, concessions and similar property interests may    be disputed.     No assurances can be given that title defects to the Palmarejo    project do not exist. The Palmarejo project may be subject to    prior unregistered agreements, interests or native land claims    and title may be affected by undetected defects. There may be    challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the    Palmarejo project that, if successful, could impair development    and/or    operations. A defect could result in Coeur losing all or a    portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the    properties to which the title defect relates. Also, while Coeur    believes that the registration defects relating to certain    non-material properties as described herein will be remedied,    there can be no assurance as to timing or successful completion. The    market price of our common stock has been volatile and may    decline.     The market price of our common stock has been volatile and may    decline in the future. The market price of our common stock    historically has fluctuated widely and been affected by our    operating results and by many factors beyond our control. These    factors include: market prices of silver and gold; general stock    market conditions; interest rates; expectations regarding    inflation; currency values; and global and regional political    and economic conditions and other factors. Conversion    of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes will    dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders,    including holders who had previously converted their Senior    Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes.     To the extent we issue shares of our common stock upon    conversion of the Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible    Notes, the conversion of some or all of such notes will dilute    the ownership interests of existing stockholders, including    holders who had previously converted their notes. Any sales in    the public market of shares of our common stock issuable upon    such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices    of shares of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the    Senior Secured Floating Rate Convertible Notes may encourage    short selling by market participants because the conversion of    such notes could depress the price of shares of our common stock.    20Table of ContentsWe    have the ability to issue additional equity securities, which    would lead to dilution of our issued and outstanding common    stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of our    common stock.     The issuance of additional equity securities or securities    convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of    existing shareholders equity interests in the Company. We    are authorized to issue, without shareholder approval,    10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series    to establish the number of shares to be included in each series    and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative    participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of    the shares of each series as well as the qualification,    limitations or restrictions on each series, including but not    limited to the fixing or alteration of the dividend rights,    dividend rate or rates, conversion rights, voting rights, rights    and terms of redemption, the redemption price or prices and the    liquidation preferences of any wholly unissued series of shares    of preferred stock, or any or all of them. Any series of    preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion    rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices,    liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights    of holders of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has no    present intention of issuing any preferred stock, but reserves    the right to do so in the future and has reserved for issuance a    series of preferred stock in connection with our shareholder    rights plan. If we issue additional equity securities, the price    of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected. We are    subject to anti-takeover provisions in our charter, in our    bylaws and in our shareholder rights plan that could delay or    prevent an acquisition of Coeur even if such an acquisition    would be beneficial to our shareholders.     Certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and our    bylaws could provide the ability to delay or prevent a third    party from acquiring us, even if doing so might be beneficial to    our shareholders. Some of these provisions (i) authorize    the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued    by the Board of Directors without prior shareholder approval,    commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock,    with rights senior to those of common stock; (ii) authorize    the Board of Directors to increase or decrease the size of the    board without shareholder approval; (iii) authorize a    majority of the directors then in office to fill any vacancy on    the Board of Directors; and (iv) require that a fair    price be paid in some business transactions. We have also    implemented a shareholder rights plan which could delay or    prevent a third party from acquiring us. "
4,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2008-02-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
          The following information sets forth information relating to important risks and uncertaintiesthat could materially adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition or operatingresults. References to we, our and us in these risk factors refer to the Company. Additionalrisks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may alsoimpair our business operations.The market prices of silver and gold are volatile. If we experience low silver and gold prices itmay result in decreased revenues and decreased net income or losses, and may negatively affect ourbusiness.          Silver and gold are commodities. Their prices fluctuate, and are affected by many factorsbeyond our control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation,currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles,global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors.Because we currently derive approximately 70% of our revenues from continuing operations from salesof silver, our earnings are primarily related to the price of this metal.7           The market prices of silver (Handy & Harman) and gold (London Final) on February 12, 2008 were$17.32 and $917 per ounce, respectively. The prices of silver and gold may decline in the future.Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in the price of silver includesales by private and government holders, and a general global economic slowdown.          Coeur may also suffer from declines in mineral prices. Since 1999, Coeur has not engaged inany silver hedging activities and is currently not engaged in any gold hedging activities.Accordingly, Coeur has no protection from declines in mineral prices or currency fluctuations.          If the prices of silver and gold are depressed for a sustained period and our net lossesresume, we may be forced to suspend mining at one or more of our properties until the pricesincrease, and to record additional asset impairment write-downs. Any lost revenues, continued orincreased net losses or additional asset impairment write-downs would adversely affect our resultsof operations.We may be required to incur additional indebtedness to fund our capital expenditures.          We have historically financed our operations through the issuance of common stock andconvertible debt, and may be required to incur additional indebtedness in the future. During 2008,we will have construction activities at the San Bartolomé, Palmarejo and Kensington projects aswell as sustaining capital projects at our operating properties. Construction of all of theseprojects could require a total capital investment of approximately $398.5 million during 2008. Ourcash, cash equivalents and short-term investments combined with cash flow generated from operationswill not be sufficient for us to make this level of capital investment and no assurance can begiven that additional capital investments will not be required to be made at these or otherprojects. If we are unable to generate enough cash to finance such additional capital expendituresthrough operating cash flow and the issuance of common stock, we may be required to issueadditional indebtedness or secure other forms of financing or delay the capital projects. Anyadditional indebtedness would increase our debt payment obligations, and may negatively impact ourresults of operations.Prior to 2005, we did not have sufficient earnings to cover fixed charges, which deficiency couldoccur in future periods.          As a result of our net losses prior to 2005, our earnings were not adequate to satisfy fixedcharges (i.e., interest, preferred stock dividends and that portion of rent deemed representativeof interest) in each of those periods prior to 2005. The amounts by which earnings were inadequateto cover fixed charges were approximately $80.8 million in 2002, $63.9 million in 2003 and $22.7million in 2004. Earnings have been sufficient to cover fixed charges subsequent to 2004. We arerequired to make fixed payments on the $180 million principal amount of our 11/4% Senior ConvertibleNotes due 2024, requiring annual interest payments of approximately $2.25 million until theirmaturity.          We expect to satisfy our fixed charges and other expense obligations in the future from cashflow from operations and, if cash flow from operations is insufficient, from working capital, whichamounted to approximately $152.4 million at December 31, 2007. Prior to 2005, we experiencednegative cash flow from operating activities. The amount of net cash used in our operatingactivities amounted to approximately $8.5 million in 2002, $5.1 million in 2003 and $18.6 millionin 2004. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we generated $40.1 million and $91.2million, respectively, of operating cash flow. The availability of future cash flow fromoperations or working capital to fund the payment of interest on the notes and other fixed chargeswill be dependent upon numerous factors, including our results of operations, silver and goldprices, levels and costs of production at our mining properties and the amount of our capitalexpenditures and expenditures for acquisitions, developmental and exploratory activities.8 We may have to record write-downs, which could negatively impact our results of operations.          Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposalof Long-Lived Assets (SFAS 144) established accounting standards for impairment of the value oflong-lived assets such as mining properties. SFAS 144 requires a company to review therecoverability of the cost of its assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expectedto result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing anassets carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the assetexceeds these cash flows, and recognizing impairment write-downs could negatively impact ourresults of operations.          If silver or gold prices decline or we fail to control production costs or realize the minableore reserves at our mining properties, we may be required to recognize asset write-downs. We alsomay record other types of additional mining property charges in the future to the extent a propertyis sold by us for a price less than the carrying value of the property, or if reclamationliabilities have to be increased in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property.Additional write-downs of mining properties could negatively impact our results of operations.          The Kensington property has been the subject of litigation involving a permit required tocomplete construction of a required tailings facility. On September 12, 2005 three environmentalgroups (Plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Alaska against the U.S. ArmyCorps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers) and the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) seeking toinvalidate the permit issued to Coeur Alaska, Inc. for the Companys Kensington mine. ThePlaintiffs claim the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineersauthorizing the deposition of mine tailings into Lower Slate Lake conflicts with the CWA. Theyadditionally claim the USFSs approval of the Amended Plan of Operations is arbitrary andcapricious because it relies on the 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineers. Following theDistrict Courts remand of the Section 404 permit to the Corps of Engineers for further review, theCorps reinstated the Companys permit on March 29, 2006. The lawsuit challenging the permit wasre-opened on April 6, 2006; Coeur Alaska filed its answer to the Amended Complaint; and CoeurAlaska, the State of Alaska, and Goldbelt, Inc., a local native corporation, were grantedDefendant-Intervenor status to join the agencies in their defense of the permit.          On August 4, 2006, the Federal District Court in Alaska dismissed the Plaintiffs challengeand upheld the Section 404 permit. On August 7, 2006 the Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal ofthe decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit Court) and on August 9, 2006the Plaintiffs additionally filed a Motion for Injunction Pending Appeal with the Ninth CircuitCourt. The Ninth Circuit Court granted a temporary injunction pending appeal on August 24, 2006,enjoining certain activities relating to the lake tailings facility.          On May 22, 2007 the Ninth Circuit Court reversed the District Courts August 4, 2006 decisionwhich had upheld the Companys 404 permit and issued its opinion that remanded the case to theDistrict Court with instructions to vacate the Companys 404 permit as well as the USFS Record ofDecision approving the general tailings disposal plan as well as the Goldbelt 404 permit toconstruct the Cascade Point Marine Facility. On August 20, 2007, Coeur Alaska filed a Petition forRehearing En Banc with the Ninth Circuit Court, as did the State of Alaska and Goldbelt, Inc. TheDepartment of Justice, on behalf of the Corps of Engineers, and USFS additionally filed a limited Petition forRehearing with the Ninth Circuit panel seeking reconsideration of the mandate of the May 22, 2007panel decision. On October 29, 2007, the Ninth Circuit denied the Petitions for Rehearing En Banc.On November 14, 2007 the Ninth Circuit granted a stay of the mandate pending further appeal to theSupreme Court, subject to the development of a reclamation plan for the lake area. The Company, andthe State of Alaska, filed Petitions for Certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States onJanuary 28, 2008. The Company cannot now predict the potential for obtaining further appeal or ifit will prevail upon appeal if one is granted.9           This litigation has contributed to an increase in capital costs. While the Company cannot nowpredict with certainty the outcome of this litigation, it believes it should ultimately prevail. Inthe event that the Company does not prevail, it could be necessary to seek an alternate site for the tailings disposalfacility. The Company has identified an alternate site which it believes can be permitted and hassubmitted a modified plan to the USFS. Based upon the Companys current estimates, an impairmentwritedown could be necessary should the expectation of the long-term price for gold decrease belowapproximately $606 per ounce. As of December 31, 2007, the carrying value of the Kensingtonprojects long-lived assets was $298.2 million.          Additionally, the value allocated to Palmarejos long-lived assets will be subject toassessments of recoverability under SFAS 144 and these assessments could result in writedowns ofcarrying values in future periods.Coeur may not realize the cost savings and other benefits it currently anticipates due tochallenges associated with integrating operations, personnel and other aspects of the companies anddue to liabilities that may exist at Bolnisi and Palmarejo.          Coeurs acquisition of Bolnisi and Palmarejo reflected its expectation that the acquisitionswill result in increased metal production, earnings and cash flow for the combined company. Theseanticipated increases will depend in part on whether Coeurs, Bolnisis and Palmarejos operationscan be integrated in an efficient and effective manner, and whether the project development in factproduces the benefits anticipated. Most operational and strategic decisions, and certain staffingdecisions, with respect to the combined company have not yet been made and may not have been fullyidentified. These decisions and the integration of the three companies will present significantchallenges to management, including the integration of systems and personnel of the threecompanies, and special risks, including possible unanticipated liabilities, significant one-timewrite-offs or restructuring charges, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees. There canbe no assurance that there will be operational or other synergies realized by the combined company,or that the integration of the three companies operations, management and cultures will be timelyor effectively accomplished, or ultimately will be successful in increasing earnings and reducingcosts. In addition, the integration of Bolnisi and Palmarejo may subject Coeur to liabilitiesexisting at one or both of Bolnisi and Palmarejo, some of which may be unknown. While Coeur hasconducted due diligence on the operations of Bolnisi and Palmarejo, there can be no guarantee thatCoeur is aware of any and all liabilities of Bolnisi and Palmarejo. These liabilities, and anyadditional risks and uncertainties related to the acquisitions not currently known to Coeur or thatCoeur may currently deem immaterial, could negatively impact Coeurs business, financial conditionand results of operations.The Palmarejo project is a development-stage project and involves significant risks associated withdevelopment and commencement of commercial production.          There can be no assurance that significant losses will not occur at the Palmarejo project inthe near future or that the Palmarejo project will be profitable in the future. Coeurs operatingexpenses and capital expenditures may increase in subsequent years as needed consultants, personneland equipment associated with advancing exploration, development and commercial production of thePalmarejo project and any other properties Coeur may acquire are added. The amounts and timing ofexpenditures will depend on the progress of ongoing exploration and development and the results ofconsultants analyses and recommendations, which are beyond Coeurs control. While Coeur expectsproduction at the Palmarejo project to commence in 2009, there can be no assurance that thistimetable will be met. The development of the Palmarejo project and any other properties Coeur mayacquire will require the commitment of substantial resources to conduct the time-consumingexploration and development of properties. There can be no assurance that Coeur will generate anyrevenues or achieve profitability at the Palmarejo project and any other properties Coeur mayacquire.10 Recently discovered settlement and subsidence issues at the Palmarejo project may increasedevelopment costs and delay the start of production.          In early August 2007, Coeur representatives observed previously unnoticed ground settlementand subsidence in three main areas: the lower plant site, the upper plant site, and the site wherethe power plant is to be located. The initial engineering review conducted by Coeur technicalpersonnel as well as third party engineering consultants concluded that the settlement andsubsidence was occurring primarily due to issues with the original compaction and placement of fillmaterial. This settlement became visible once heavy rainfall was experienced. Since that time,Coeurs third party engineering consultants have conducted more extensive on-site analysis and haveprovided Coeur with a detailed report based on its review, which recommends specific remedialactions that should be initiated which includes the relocation of a substantial section of theprocess plant facilities to an identified alternate site. Coeur estimates that these remedialactions may cost up to $15 million, which is an estimate endorsed by Coeurs third partyengineering consultants. Coeur anticipates production from the Palmarejo project to commence inthe first quarter of 2009, which takes into account the estimated time to complete these remedialactivities. There can be no assurance that these preliminary estimates will prove accurate, andany inaccuracy in such estimates could materially adversely impact the development of the Palmarejoproject and Coeurs financial condition and results of operations.Our revenues and income (or loss) from our interest in the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines aredependent in part upon the performance of the operators of the mine.          In May and September 2005, we acquired silver production and reserves at the Endeavor andBroken Hill mines in Australia, respectively. These mines are owned and operated by other miningcompanies. The Companys revenues and income (or loss) from its interest in the silver productionat these mines are dependent in part upon the performance of those operators and such mines.The estimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated orereserves may not be realized in actual production. Our operating results may be negatively affectedby inaccurate estimates.          The ore reserve figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technicalpersonnel. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require usto make assumptions about production costs and silver and gold market prices. Reserve estimation isan imprecise and subjective process and the accuracy of such estimates is a function of the qualityof available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience.Assumptions about silver and gold market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those priceshave fluctuated widely in the past. Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may renderreserves containing relatively lower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required toreduce reserve estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties, orwrite down assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any ofour mines or projects different from those we predicted, we may adjust our reserve estimates andalter our mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect our actual production andoperating results.          We based our ore reserve determinations as of December 31, 2007 on a long-term silver priceaverage of $11 per ounce, with the exception of the Endeavor mine which uses $15 per ounce and theBroken Hill mine which uses $13.50 per ounce of silver, and a long-term gold price average of $600per ounce for all properties with the exception of the Kensington property which used a gold priceof $550 per ounce. On February 12, 2008 silver and gold prices were $17.32 per ounce and $917 perounce, respectively.The estimation of the ultimate recovery of metals contained within the Rochester heap leach padinventory is inherently inaccurate and subjective and requires the use of estimation techniques.Actual recoveries can be expected to vary from estimations.          The Rochester mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract silver and gold from ore. Theheap leach process is a process of extracting silver and gold by placing ore on an impermeable padand applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained silver and gold,which are then recovered in metallurgical processes.11           The key stages in the conversion of ore into silver and gold are (i) the blasting process inwhich the ore is broken into large pieces; (ii) the processing of the ore through a crushingfacility that breaks it into smaller pieces; (iii) the transportation of the crushed ore to theleach pad where the leaching solution is applied; (iv) the collection of the leach solution; (v)subjecting the leach solution to the precipitation process, in which gold and silver is convertedback to a fine solid; (vi) the conversion of the precipitate into doré; and (vii) the conversion bya third party refinery of the doré into refined silver and gold bullion.          We use several integrated steps to scientifically measure the metal content of ore placed onthe leach pads during the key stages. As the ore body is drilled in preparation for the blastingprocess, samples of the drill residue are assayed to determine estimated quantities of containedmetal. We estimate the quantity of ore by utilizing global positioning satellite survey techniques.We then process the ore through a crushing facility where the output is again weighed and sampledfor assaying. A metallurgical reconciliation with the data collected from the mining operation iscompleted with appropriate adjustments made to previous estimates. We then transport the crushedore to the leach pad for application of the leaching solution. As the leach solution is collectedfrom the leach pads, we continuously sample for assaying. We measure the quantity of leach solutionwith flow meters throughout the leaching and precipitation process. After precipitation, theproduct is converted to doré, which is the final product produced by the mine. We again weigh,sample and assay the doré. Finally, a third party smelter converts the doré and determines finalounces of silver and gold available for sale. We then review this end result and reconcile it tothe estimates we developed and used throughout the production process. Based on this review, weadjust our estimation procedures when appropriate.          Our reported inventories include metals estimated to be contained in the ore on leach pad of$50.9 million as of December 31, 2007. Of this amount, $25.9 million is reported as a current assetand $25.0 million is reported as a noncurrent asset. The distinction between current and noncurrentis based upon the expected length of time necessary for the leaching process to remove the metalsfrom the crushed ore. The historical cost of the metal that is expected to be extracted withintwelve months is classified as current and the historical cost of metals contained within thecrushed ore that will be extracted beyond twelve months is classified as noncurrent. The ore onleach pad inventory is stated at actual production costs incurred to produce and place ore on theleach pad during the current period, adjusted for the effects on monthly production costs ofabnormal production levels.          The estimate of both the ultimate recovery expected over time, and the quantity of metal thatmay be extracted relative to such twelve month period, requires the use of estimates which areinherently inaccurate since they rely upon laboratory test work. Test work consists of 60 day leachcolumns from which we project metal recoveries into the future. The quantities of metal containedin the ore are based upon actual weights and assay analysis. The rate at which the leach processextracts gold and silver from the crushed ore is based upon laboratory column tests and actualexperience occurring over approximately nineteen years of leach pad operation at the Rochestermine. The assumptions we use to measure metal content during each stage of the inventory conversionprocess includes estimated recovery rates based on laboratory testing and assaying. We periodicallyreview our estimates compared to actual experience and revise our estimates when appropriate. Thelength of time necessary to achieve our currently estimated ultimate recoveries of between 59% and61.5% for silver, depending on the area being leached, and 93% for gold is estimated to be between5 and 10 years. In August 2007, the Company terminated mining and crushing operations as orereserves were fully mined. Residual heap leach activities are expected to continue through 2011.          When we began leach operations in 1986, based solely on laboratory testing, we estimated theultimate recovery of silver and gold at 50% and 80%, respectively. Since 1986, we have adjusted theexpected ultimate recovery three times (once in each of 1989, 1997 and 2003) based upon actualexperience gained from leach operations. In 2003, we increased our estimated recoveries for silverand gold, respectively, to between 59% and 61.5% for silver, depending on the area being leached,and 93% for gold. The leach cycle at the Rochester Mine requires leaching to approximately the year 2011 for all recoverable metal to be recovered.12           If our estimate of ultimate recovery requires adjustment, the impact upon our inventoryvaluation and upon our income statement would be as follows:                           Positive/Negative Positive/Negative  Change in Silver Recovery Change in Gold Recovery  1% 2% 3% 1% 2% 3%Quantity of recoverableounces 1.7 million 3.5 million 5.2 million  13,240   26,480   39,720 Positive impact onfuture cost ofproduction per silverequivalent ounce forincreases in recoveryrates $1.68  $2.78  $3.55  $0.82  $1.49  $2.04 Negative impact onfuture cost ofproduction per silverequivalent ounce fordecreases in recoveryrates $(2.93) $(9.30) $(33.77) $(1.04) $(2.38) $(4.21)          Inventories of ore on leach pads are valued based upon actual production costs incurred toproduce and place such ore on the leach pad during the current period, adjusted for the effects onmonthly production costs of abnormal production levels, less costs allocated to minerals recoveredthrough the leach process. The costs consist of those production activities occurring at the minesite and include the costs, including depreciation, associated with mining, crushing andprecipitation circuits. In addition, refining is provided by a third party refiner to place themetal extracted from the leach pad in a saleable form. These additional costs are considered in thevaluation of inventory. Negative changes in our inventory valuations and correspondingly on ourincome statement would have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position andcash flows.Our estimates of current and non-current inventories may not be realized in actual production andoperating results, which may negatively affect our business.          We use estimates, based on prior production results and experiences, to determine whether heapleach inventory will be recovered more than one year in the future, and is non-current inventory,or will be recovered within one year, and is current inventory. The estimates involve assumptionsthat may not prove to be consistent with our actual production and operating results. We cannotdetermine the amount ultimately recoverable until leaching is completed. If our estimates proveinaccurate, our operating results may be less than anticipated.Silver mining involves significant production and operational risks. Coeur may suffer from thefailure to efficiently operate its mining projects.          Silver mining involves significant degrees of risk, including those related to mineralexploration success, unexpected geological or mining conditions, the development of new deposits,climatic conditions, equipment and/or service failures, compliance with current or new governmentalrequirements, current availability of or delays in installing and commissioning plant andequipment, import or customs delays and other general operating risks. Problems may also arise dueto the quality or failure of locally obtained equipment or interruptions to services (such aspower, water, fuel or transport or processing capacity) or technical support, which results in thefailure to achieve expected target dates for exploration or production activities and/or result ina requirement for greater expenditure. The right to export silver and gold may depend on obtainingcertain licenses and quotas, the granting of which may be at the discretion of the relevantregulatory authorities. There may be delays in obtaining such licenses and quotas leading to thefinancial result of Coeur being adversely affected, and it is possible that from time to timeexport licenses may be refused. Many of these risks are outside of the ability of Coeursmanagement to control and may result in a materially adverse effect on Coeurs operations,financial position and cash flows.13 Mineral exploration and development inherently involves significant and irreducible financialrisks. Coeur may suffer from the failure to find and develop profitable mines.          The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant financial risks,which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate.Unprofitable efforts may result from the failure to discover mineral deposits. Even if mineraldeposits are found, such deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profitfrom production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which timethe economic viability of the project may change. Few properties which are explored are ultimatelydeveloped into producing mines. Mining companies rely on consultants and others for exploration,development, construction and operating expertise.          Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract metals from ores and,in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economicfeasibility of any development project is based upon, among other things, estimates of the size andgrade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power),metallurgical recoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs of such developmentprojects, and metals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of favorablefeasibility studies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequatefinancing.          Once a mineral deposit is developed, whether it will be commercially viable depends on anumber of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade andproximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure;land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental protection; and mineral prices.Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, powersources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government orother interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factorsare highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but thecombination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.Significant investment risks and operational costs are associated with our exploration, developmentand mining activities, such as San Bartolomé, Kensington and Palmarejo. These risks and costs mayresult in lower economic returns and may adversely affect our business.          Our ability to sustain or increase our present production levels depends in part on successfulexploration and development of new ore bodies and/or expansion of existing mining operations.Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks and is frequentlyunproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of years until production ispossible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Substantialexpenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract metals from ores and, in the case ofnew properties, to construct mining and processing facilities. The economic feasibility of anydevelopment project is based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of orereserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power), metallurgicalrecoveries, production rates and capital and operating costs of such development projects, andmetals prices. Development projects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibilitystudies, issuance and maintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing.          Development projects, such as San Bartolomé, Kensington and Palmarejo, may have no operatinghistory upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements.Development project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costsare to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data obtained from a limited numberof drill holes and other sampling techniques and feasibility studies. Estimates of cash operatingcosts are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed,the configuration of the orebody, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparablefacility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions andother factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of any and all development projects may materiallydiffer from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, our business results of operationsmay be negatively affected.14 The Companys marketing of metals concentrates could be adversely affected if there were to be asignificant delay or disruption of purchases by its third party smelter customers. In particular,a significant delay or disruption in our sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpecteddiscontinuation of purchases by our smelter customers could have a material adverse effect on ouroperations.          The Company currently markets its silver and gold concentrates to third party smelters inMexico, Japan and Australia. The loss of any one smelter customer could have a material adverseeffect on us in the event of the possible unavailability of alternative smelters. No assurance canbe given that alternative smelters would be timely available if the need for them were to arise, orthat delays or disruptions in sales could not be experienced that would result in a materiallyadverse effect on our operations and our financial results.Our silver and gold production may decline, reducing our revenues and negatively impacting ourbusiness.          Our future silver and gold production may decline as a result of an exhaustion of reserves andpossible closure of mines. It is our business strategy to conduct silver and gold exploratoryactivities at our existing mining and exploratory properties as well as at new exploratoryprojects, and to acquire silver and gold mining properties and businesses or reserves that possessminable ore reserves and are expected to become operational in the near future. We can provide noassurance that our silver and gold production in the future will not decline. Accordingly, ourrevenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline, negatively affecting our results ofoperations.There are significant hazards associated with our mining activities, some of which may not be fullycovered by insurance. To the extent we must pay the costs associated with such risks, our businessmay be negatively affected.          The mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards,industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins,flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions.These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or productionfacilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays inmining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although we maintaininsurance in an amount that we consider to be adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, inwhich event we could incur significant costs that could adversely affect our results of operation.Insurance fully covering many environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution orother hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production)is not generally available to us or to other companies in the industry. The realization of anysignificant liabilities in connection with our mining activities as described above couldnegatively affect our results of operations.We are subject to significant governmental regulations, and their related costs and delays maynegatively affect our business.          Coeurs mining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws andregulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development,production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safetylaws and regulations including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters related to Coeursbusiness. Although these laws and regulations have never required Coeur to close any mine, thecosts associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Possible futurelaws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations bygovernmental authorities could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on orsuspensions of Coeurs operations and delays in the development of its properties.15           In addition, government approvals, approval of aboriginal people and permits are currently andmay in the future be required in connection with the Palmarejo project. To the extent suchapprovals are required and not obtained, Coeur may be curtailed or prohibited from planned miningoperations or continuing its planned exploration or development of mineral properties at thePalmarejo project.          Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result inenforcement actions thereunder, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authoritiescausing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capitalexpenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. Parties engaged in miningoperations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensatethose suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminalfines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations.Compliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations couldrequire significant expenditures.          Environmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and waterquality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation,transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation isevolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines andpenalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and aheightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees.          To the extent Coeur is subject to environmental liabilities, the payment of such liabilitiesor the costs that it may incur to remedy environmental pollution would reduce funds otherwiseavailable to it and could have a material adverse effect on the combined company. If Coeur isunable to fully remedy an environmental problem, it might be required to suspend operations orenter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The potentialexposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect.          Moreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage toproperty and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts ofCoeurs past and current operations, which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines,remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs andliabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent inCoeurs operations. Although Coeur believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicablelaws and regulations, Coeur cannot assure you that any such law, regulation, enforcement or privateclaim will not have a negative effect on its business, financial condition or results ofoperations.          Some of Coeurs mining wastes are currently exempt to a limited extent from the extensive setof federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations governing hazardous waste under theResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). If the EPA designates these wastes as hazardousunder RCRA, Coeur would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes andto make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposal facilities. In addition, ifany of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a mining facility, suchfacility may be designated as a Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). Under CERCLA, any owner or operator of a Superfund sitesince the time of its contamination may be held liable and may be forced to undertake extensiveremedial cleanup action or to pay for the governments cleanup efforts. Such owner or operator mayalso be liable to governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which may besubstantial. Additional regulations or requirements are also imposed upon Coeurs tailings andwaste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and in Nevada under theNevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA. Airborne emissions are subject tocontrols under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada and Alaska.16 Compliance with CERCLA, the CWA and state environmental laws could entail significant costs,which could have a material adverse effect on Coeurs operations.          In the context of environmental permits, including the approval of reclamation plans, Coeurmust comply with standards and regulations which entail significant costs and can entailsignificant delays. Such costs and delays could have a dramatic impact on Coeurs operations.There is no assurance that future changes in environmental regulation, if any, will not adverselyaffect Coeurs operations. Coeur intends to fully comply with all applicable environmentalregulations.We are required to obtain government permits to expand operations or begin new operations. Theacquisition of such permits can be materially impacted by third party litigation seeking to preventthe issuance of such permits. The costs and delays associated with such approvals could affect ouroperations, reduce our revenues, and negatively affect our business as a whole.          Mining companies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of existingoperations or for the commencement of new operations such as the Kensington development project andthe Palmarejo project. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consumingprocess involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costlyundertakings. The duration and success of permitting efforts are contingent on many factors thatare out of our control. The governmental approval process may increase costs and cause delaysdepending on the nature of the activity to be permitted, and could cause us to not proceed with thedevelopment of a mine. Accordingly, this approval process could harm our results of operations.          Reference is made to the discussion of the current litigation regarding the validity of themine tailings permit at the Kensington property in Alaska that is set forth under the above riskfactor entitled We may have to record additional write-downs, which could negatively impact ourresults of operations.          Meanwhile, although Palmarejo currently holds all consents that it requires in order to carryout its current drilling and development program on the Palmarejo project, Coeur cannot be certainthat it will receive the necessary permits on acceptable terms to conduct further exploration andto develop the Palmarejo project in accordance with its pre-feasibility study. The failure toobtain such permits, or delays in obtaining such permits, could increase costs and delayactivities, and could adversely affect the Palmarejo project.Our business depends on good relations with our employees.          The Company could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in productionthat could adversely affect us. As of December 31, 2007, unions represented approximately 44% ofour worldwide workforce. On that date, the Company had 316 employees at its Cerro Bayo mine and 120employees at its Martha mine who were working under a collective bargaining agreement. Theagreement covering the Cerro Bayo mine expires on December 21, 2010 and a collective bargainingagreement covering the Martha mine expires on June 1, 2008. Additionally, the Company had 21employees at its San Bartolomé project working under a labor agreement which does not have a fixedterm.We are an international company and are exposed to risks in the countries in which we havesignificantoperations or interests. Foreign instability or variances in foreign currencies may causeunforeseen losses, which may affect our business.          Any foreign operations or investment is subject to political and economic risks anduncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may include exchange controls; extreme fluctuationsin currency exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labor unrest; civil unrest; militaryrepression; expropriation and nationalization; renegotiation or nullification of existingconcessions, licenses, permits and contracts; illegal mining; changes in taxation policies;restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation, and laws or policies in the U.S. affectingforeign trade17 investment and taxation. Further, foreign operations or investment is subject to changes ingovernment regulations with respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on production, pricecontrols, export controls, currency remittance, income taxes, expropriation of property, foreigninvestment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of localpeople, water use and mine safety.          Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and Australia are the most significant foreign countries in whichCoeur now directly or indirectly owns or operates mining properties or developmental projects.Coeur also conducts exploratory projects in these countries. With the acquisition of Palmarejo andBolnisi, Coeur also owns a major mining operation in Mexico. Argentina and Bolivia, whilecurrently economically and politically stable, have experienced political instability, provincialgovernment pressures on mining operations, currency value fluctuations and changes in bankingregulations in recent years. It is uncertain at this time how new mining or investment policies orshifts in political attitude may affect mining in these countries.          Coeur may enter into agreements which require Coeur to purchase currencies of foreigncountries in which Coeur does business in order to ensure fixed exchange rates. In the event thatactual exchange rates vary from those set forth in the hedge contracts, Coeur will experience U.S.dollar-denominated currency gains or losses. Future economic or political instabilities or changesin the laws of foreign countries in which Coeur has significant operations or interests andunfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact its foreignoperations and its business as a whole. Further, property ownership in a foreign country isgenerally subject to the risk of expropriation or nationalization with inadequate compensation.Coeur is exposed to risks with respect to the legal systems in the countries in which it hassignificant operations or interests, and resolutions of any disputes may adversely affect itsbusiness.          Some of the jurisdictions in which Coeur currently and may in the future operate have lessdeveloped legal systems than would be found in more established economies like the United States.This may result in risks such as potential difficulties in obtaining effective legal redress in thecourts of such jurisdictions, whether in respect of a breach of law or regulation, or in anownership dispute; a higher degree of discretion on the part of governmental authorities; the lackof judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules and regulations;inconsistencies or conflicts between and within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders andresolutions; or relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters.          In certain jurisdictions the commitment of local business people, government officials andagencies and the judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may beuncertain, creating particular concerns with respect to licenses and agreements for business.These may be susceptible to revision or cancellation and legal redress may be uncertain or delayed.There can be no assurance that joint ventures, licenses, license applications or other legalarrangements will not be adversely affected by the actions of government authorities or others andthe effectiveness of and enforcement of such arrangements in these jurisdictions cannot be assured.Any of our future acquisitions may result in significant risks, which may adversely affect ourbusiness.          An important element of our business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver andgold mines, properties and businesses or interests therein. While it is our practice to engageindependent mining consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any miningproperties or interests therein we may acquire may not be developed profitably or, if profitablewhen acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection with any futureacquisitions, we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in increased interestexpense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existing shareholders. We intend to seekshareholder approval for any such acquisitions to the extent required by applicable law,regulations or stock exchange rules. We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on theprice of our business or our common stock. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness orissuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions, may impact the price of our common stock and negatively affect our results of operations.18 Coeur is continuously considering possible acquisitions of additional mining properties orinterests therein that are located in other countries, and could be exposed to significant risksassociated with any such acquisitions.          In the ordinary course of Coeurs business, Coeur is continuously considering the possibleacquisition of additional significant mining properties or interests therein that may be located incountries other than those in which Coeur now has operations or interests. Consequently, inaddition to the risks inherent in the valuation and acquisition of such mining properties, as wellas the subsequent development, operation or ownership thereof, Coeur could be subject to additionalrisks in such countries as a result of governmental policies, economic instability, currency valuefluctuations and other risks associated with the development, operation or ownership of miningproperties or interests therein. Such risks could adversely affect Coeurs results of operations.Ourability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain. Accordingly, our prospects areuncertain for the future growth of our business.          Because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, we are continuallyseeking to replace and expand our ore reserves. Identifying promising mining properties isdifficult and speculative. Furthermore, we encounter strong competition from other mining companiesin connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing silver and gold.Many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do. Consequently, we may be unableto replace and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties orinterests therein on terms we consider acceptable. As a result, our revenues from the sale ofsilver and gold may decline, resulting in lower income and reduced growth.Third parties may dispute our unpatented mining claims, which could result in the discovery ofdefective titles and losses affecting our business.          The validity of unpatented mining claims, which constitute a significant portion of Coeursproperty holdings in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Although Coeurhas attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, Coeur, in accordance withmining industry practice, does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made todevelop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties, maybe defective. Defective title to any of Coeurs mining claims could result in litigation,insurance claims, and potential losses affecting its business as a whole.          The acquisition of title to concessions and similar property interests is a detailed and timeconsuming process. Title to, and the area of, concessions and similar property interests may bedisputed.          No assurances can be given that title defects to the Palmarejo project do not exist. ThePalmarejo project may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, interests or native land claimsand title may be affected by undetected defects. There may be valid challenges to the title of anyof the claims comprising the Palmarejo project that, if successful, could impair development and/oroperations. A defect could result in Coeur losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate andinterest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates. Also, while Coeur believesthat the registration defects relating to certain non-material properties as described herein willbe remedied; there can be no assurance as to timing or successful completion.Coeur does not own all of the concessions comprising the Palmarejo project, and Coeurs failure tocomply with its contractual commitments on such properties may result in their loss.          Planet Gold, S.A. de C.V., a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Palmarejo, is the registeredowner of most but not all of the concessions comprising the Palmarejo project. If Coeur fails tomeet payments or work commitments on these properties, Coeur may lose its interests in a portion of the Palmarejoproject or forfeit some of the concessions.19 "
9,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2007-02-22,"Risk Factors
         Thefollowing information sets forth information relating to important risks and uncertaintiesthat could materially adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition oroperating results. References to we, our and us inthese risk factors refer to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do notpresently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our businessoperations. Risks Relating to ourBusiness Prior to 2005, weincurred losses due to several factors and could incur losses in the future.         Weincurred net losses in the five years prior to 2005 and had losses from continuingoperations in each of those prior periods. Factors that significantly contributed to ourlosses were: 8   historicallylow gold and silver market prices during those years;  ourdeliberate pursuit of a growth policy prior to 2003 calling for the acquisition of miningproperties and companies and financing such growth principally by incurring convertibleindebtedness which had a high coupon rate, thereby resulting in an interest expense of$21.9 million in 2002, $12.9 million in 2003 and $2.8 million in 2004;   write-offsfor impaired assets and other holding costs in 2002 of $19.0 million; and  losseson the early retirement of debt of $19.1 million in 2002, and $41.6 million in 2003.        Ifsilver and gold prices decline and we are unable to reduce our production costs, ourlosses may resume. If lower silver and gold prices make mining at our propertiesuneconomical, we may be required to recognize impairment write-downs, which would increaseour operating losses and negatively impact our results of operations. We may be required toincur additional indebtedness to fund our capital expenditures.         Wehave historically financed our operations through the issuance of common stock andconvertible debt, and may be required to incur additional indebtedness in the future.During 2004, we commenced construction at the San Bartolome project and in 2005 wecommenced construction at Kensington project. Construction of both projects could requirea total capital investment of approximately $398.0 million of which approximately $196.4million will be required in future periods. While we believe that our cash, cashequivalents and short-term investments combined with cash flow generated from operationswill be sufficient for us to make this level of capital investment, no assurance can begiven that additional capital investments will not be required to be made at these orother projects. If we are unable to generate enough cash to finance such additionalcapital expenditures through operating cash flow and the issuance of common stock, we maybe required to issue additional indebtedness. Any additional indebtedness would increaseour debt payment obligations, and may negatively impact our results of operations. Prior to 2005, we didnot have sufficient earnings to cover fixed charges, which deficiency could occur infuture periods.         Asa result of our net losses prior to 2005, our earnings were not adequate to satisfy fixedcharges (i.e., interest, preferred stock dividends and that portion of rent deemedrepresentative of interest) in each of those periods prior to 2005. The amounts by whichearnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges were approximately $80.8 million in 2002,$63.9 million in 2003 and $22.7 million in 2004. Earnings have been sufficient to coverfixed charges subsequent to 2004. We are required to make fixed payments on the $180million principal amount of our 1¼% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024, requiringannual interest payments of approximately $2.25 million until their maturity.         Weexpect to satisfy our fixed charges and other expense obligations in the future from cashflow from operations and, if cash flow from operations is insufficient, from workingcapital, which amounted to approximately $383.1 million at December 31, 2006. Prior to2005, we experienced negative cash flow from operating activities. The amount of net cashused in our operating activities amounted to approximately $8.5 million in 2002, $5.1million in 2003 and $18.6 million in 2004. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and2005, we generated $91.2 million and $6.7 million, respectively, of operating cash flow.The availability of future cash flow from operations or working capital to fund thepayment of interest on the notes and other fixed charges will be dependent upon numerousfactors, including our results of operations, silver and gold prices, levels and costs ofproduction at our mining properties and the amount of our capital expenditures andexpenditures for acquisitions, developmental and exploratory activities. The market pricesof silver and gold are volatile. If we experience low silver and gold prices it mayresult in decreased revenues and decreased net income or losses, and may negativelyaffect our business. 9         Silverand gold are commodities. Their prices fluctuate, and are affected by many factors beyondour control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation,currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metalsstockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditionsand other factors. Because we currently derive approximately 68% of our revenues fromcontinuing operations from sales of silver, our earnings are primarily related to theprice of this metal.         Themarket prices of silver (Handy & Harman) and gold (London Final) on February 16, 2006were $13.96 and $665 per ounce, respectively. The prices of silver and gold may decline inthe future. Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in the priceof silver include sales by private and government holders, and a general global economicslowdown.         Ifthe prices of silver and gold are depressed for a sustained period and our net lossesresume, we may be forced to suspend mining at one or more of our properties until theprices increase, and to record additional asset impairment write-downs. Any lost revenues,continued or increased net losses or additional asset impairment write-downs wouldadversely affect our results of operations. We may have to recordadditional write-downs, which could negatively impact our results ofoperations.         Statementof Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal ofLong-Lived Assets (SFAS 144) established accounting standards for impairment of thevalue of long-lived assets such as mining properties. SFAS 144 requires a company toreview the recoverability of the cost of its assets by estimating the future undiscountedcash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.Impairment must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cashflows, and recognizing impairment write-downs could negatively impact our results ofoperations.         Ifsilver or gold prices decline or we fail to control production costs or realize themineable ore reserves at our mining properties, we may be required to recognize furtherasset write-downs. We also may record other types of additional mining propertywrite-downs in the future to the extent a property is sold by us for a price less than thecarrying value of the property, or if liability reserves have to be increased inconnection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Additional write-downs ofmining properties could negatively impact our results of operations.         TheKensington property has been the subject of litigation involving a permit required tocomplete construction of a required tailings facility. On September 12, 2005 threeenvironmental groups (Plaintiffs) filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court inAlaska against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps of Engineers) and theU.S. Forest Service (USFS) seeking to invalidate the permit issued to CoeurAlaska, Inc. for the Companys Kensington mine. The Plaintiffs claim the Clean WaterAct (CWA) Section 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineers authorizing the depositionof mine tailings into Lower Slate Lake conflicts with the CWA. They additionally claim theUSFSs approval of the Amended Plan of Operations is arbitrary and capricious becauseit relies on the 404 permit issued by the Corps of Engineers.         OnNovember 8, 2005, the Corps of Engineers filed a Motion for Voluntary Remand with thecourt to review the permit issued to the Company under the CWA Section 404 and requestedthat the court stay the legal proceeding filed by the plaintiffs pending the outcome ofreview. On November 12, 2005, the Federal District Court in Alaska granted the remand ofthe permit to the Corps of Engineers for further review. On November 22, 2005, the Corpsof Engineers advised the Company that it was suspending the Section 404 permit pursuant tothe Courts remand to further review the permit. 10         OnMarch 29, 2006, the Corps of Engineers reinstated the Companys 404 permit. On April6, 2006 the lawsuit challenging the permit was re-opened, and Coeur Alaska, Inc. filed itsanswer to the Amended Complaint and Motion to Intervene as a Defendant-Intervenor in theaction. Two other parties, the State of Alaska and Goldbelt, Inc., a local nativecorporation, also filed Motions to Intervene as Defendant-Intervenors as supporters of theKensington project as permitted. The Company, the State of Alaska and Goldbelt, Inc. weregranted Defendant-Intervenor status and joined the agencies in their defense of thepermits as issued.         OnAugust 4, 2006, the Federal District Court in Alaska dismissed the Plaintiffschallenge and upheld the Section 404 permit. On August 7, 2006 the Plaintiffs filed aNotice of Appeal of the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (CircuitCourt) and on August 9, 2006 Plaintiffs additionally filed a Motion for InjunctionPending Appeal with the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court granted a temporary injunctionpending appeal on August 24, 2006, enjoining certain activities relating to the laketailings facility. The Circuit Court further ordered an expedited briefing schedule on themerits of the legal challenge. On October 13, 2006, the parties filed their briefs in theCircuit Court and subsequently participated in an oral argument on December 4, 2006. Thereis no indication of when the Circuit Court may rule on the merits on appeal. The Companyis unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or the impact of the temporaryinjunction.         Thislitigation has contributed to an increase in capital costs. While the Company believes itwill ultimately prevail in the defense of the awarded permits, in the event that theCompany does not prevail, it could be necessary to seek an alternate site for the tailingsdisposal facility. The Company is not aware of an alternate site that could be permittedor would be economic. Therefore, it is possible that an adverse legal decision couldrender the project uneconomic and an asset writedown would be necessary. As aresult of the increase in capital and operating costs at the Kensington project, animpairment writedown could be necessary should the expectation of the long-term price for golddecrease below approximately $510 per ounce. As of December 31, 2006, the Kensington project has a carryingvalue of $206 million. Our revenues and income(or loss) from our interest in the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines are dependent in partupon the performance of the operators of the mine.         InMay and September 2005, we acquired silver production and reserves at the Endeavor andBroken Hill mines in Australia, respectively. These mines are owned and operated by othermining companies. The Companys revenues and income (or loss) from its interest inthe silver production at these mines are dependent in part upon the performance of thoseoperators and such mines. The estimation of ore reservesis imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated ore reserves may not berealized in actual production. Our operating results may be negatively affected byinaccurate estimates.         Theore reserve figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technicalpersonnel. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses thatrequire us to make assumptions about production costs and silver and gold market prices.Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process and the accuracy of suchestimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologicalinterpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market pricesare subject to great uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past.Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing relativelylower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required to reduce reserveestimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties, or writedown assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at anyof our mines or projects different from those we predicted, we may adjust our reserveestimates and alter our mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affectour actual production and operating results.         Webased our ore reserve determinations as of December 31, 2006 on a long-term silver priceaverage of $8.00 per ounce, with the exception of the San Bartolome mine which used $6.00per ounce, the Endeavor mine which uses $10.00 per ounce and the Broken Hill mine whichuses $10.12 per ounce of silver, and a long-term gold price average of $475 per ounce forall properties with the exception of the Kensington property which used a gold price of$550 per ounce. On February 16, 2007 silver and gold prices were $13.96 per ounce and $665per ounce, respectively. 11 The estimation of the ultimaterecovery of metals contained within the heap leach pad inventory is inherently inaccurateand subjective and requires the use of estimation techniques. Actual recoveries can beexpected to vary from estimations.         TheRochester mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract silver and gold from ore. Theheap leach process is a process of extracting silver and gold by placing ore on animpermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of thecontained silver and gold, which are then recovered in metallurgical processes.         Thekey stages in the conversion of ore into silver and gold are (i) the blasting process inwhich the ore is broken into large pieces; (ii) the processing of the ore through acrushing facility that breaks it into smaller pieces; (iii) the transportation of thecrushed ore to the leach pad where the leaching solution is applied; (iv) the collectionof the leach solution; (v) subjecting the leach solution to the precipitation process, inwhich gold and silver is converted back to a fine solid; (vi) the conversion of theprecipitate into doré; and (vii) the conversion by a third party refinery of thedoré into refined silver and gold bullion.         Weuse several integrated steps to scientifically measure the metal content of ore placed onthe leach pads during the key stages. As the ore body is drilled in preparation for theblasting process, samples of the drill residue are assayed to determine estimatedquantities of contained metal. We estimate the quantity of ore by utilizing globalpositioning satellite survey techniques. We then process the ore through a crushingfacility where the output is again weighed and sampled for assaying. A metallurgicalreconciliation with the data collected from the mining operation is completed withappropriate adjustments made to previous estimates. We then transport the crushed ore tothe leach pad for application of the leaching solution. As the leach solution is collectedfrom the leach pads, we continuously sample for assaying. We measure the quantity of leachsolution with flow meters throughout the leaching and precipitation process. Afterprecipitation, the product is converted to doré, which is the final productproduced by the mine. We again weigh, sample and assay the doré. Finally, a thirdparty smelter converts the doré and determines final ounces of silver and goldavailable for sale. We then review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates wedeveloped and used throughout the production process. Based on this review, we adjust ourestimation procedures when appropriate.         Ourreported inventories include metals estimated to be contained in the ore on the leach padsof $66.7 million as of December 31, 2006. Of this amount, $31.3 million is reported as acurrent asset and $35.4 million is reported as a noncurrent asset. The distinction betweencurrent and noncurrent is based upon the expected length of time necessary for theleaching process to remove the metals from the crushed ore. The historical cost of themetal that is expected to be extracted within twelve months is classified as current andthe historical cost of metals contained within the crushed ore that will be extractedbeyond twelve months is classified as noncurrent. The ore on leach pad inventory is statedat actual production costs incurred to produce and place ore on the leach pad during thecurrent period, adjusted for the effects on monthly production costs of abnormalproduction levels.         Theestimate of both the ultimate recovery expected over time, and the quantity of metal thatmay be extracted relative to such twelve month period, requires the use of estimates whichare inherently inaccurate since they rely upon laboratory test work. Test work consists of60 day leach columns from which we project metal recoveries into the future. Thequantities of metal contained in the ore are based upon actual weights and assay analysis.The rate at which the leach process extracts gold and silver from the crushed ore is basedupon laboratory column tests and actual experience occurring over approximately nineteenyears of leach pad operation at the Rochester mine. The assumptions we use to measuremetal content during each stage of the inventory conversion process includes estimatedrecovery rates based on laboratory testing and assaying. We periodically review ourestimates compared to actual experience and revise our estimates when appropriate. Thelength of time necessary to achieve our currently estimated ultimate recoveries of between59% and 61.5% for silver, depending on the area being leached, and 93% for gold isestimated to be between 5 and 10 years. However, the ultimate recovery will not be knownuntil leaching operations cease, which is currently estimated for approximately 2011. 12         Whenwe began leach operations in 1986, based solely on laboratory testing, we estimated theultimate recovery of silver and gold at 50% and 80%, respectively. Since 1986, we haveadjusted the expected ultimate recovery three times (once in each of 1989, 1997 and 2003)based upon actual experience gained from leach operations. In 2003, we increased ourestimated recoveries for silver and gold, respectively, to between 59% and 61.5%,depending on the area being leached for silver, and 93% for gold. The leach cycle at theRochester Mine requires leaching to approximately the year 2011 for all recoverable metalto be recovered.         Ifour estimate of ultimate recovery requires adjustment, the impact upon our inventoryvaluation and upon our income statement would be as follows: Positive/NegativeChange in Silver RecoveryPositive/NegativeChange in Gold Recovery1%2%3%1%2%3%Quantity of recoverable                ounces   1.7 million 3.4 million 5.1 million 12,900  25,800  38,700 Positive impact on    future cost of    production per silver    equivalent ounce for    increases in recovery rates   $1.06  $1.83  $2.43       $0.42       $0.79       $1.13 Negative impact on    future cost of    production per silver    equivalent ounce for    decreases in recovery rates   $1.51  $3.87  $8.03       $0.48       $1.03       $1.66         Inventoriesof ore on leach pads are valued based upon actual production costs incurred to produce andplace such ore on the leach pad during the current period, adjusted for the effects onmonthly production costs of abnormal production levels, less costs allocated to mineralsrecovered through the leach process. The costs consist of those production activitiesoccurring at the mine site and include the costs, including depreciation, associated withmining, crushing and precipitation circuits. In addition, refining is provided by a thirdparty refiner to place the metal extracted from the leach pad in a saleable form. Theseadditional costs are considered in the valuation of inventory. Negative changes in ourinventory valuations and correspondingly on our income statement would have an adverseimpact on our results of operations. Our estimates of currentand non-current inventories may not be realized in actual production and operatingresults, which may negatively affect our business.         Weuse estimates, based on prior production results and experiences, to determine whetherheap leach inventory will be recovered more than one year in the future, and isnon-current inventory, or will be recovered within one year, and is current inventory. Theestimates involve assumptions that may not prove to be consistent with our actualproduction and operating results. We cannot determine the amount ultimately recoverableuntil leaching is completed. If our estimates prove inaccurate, our operating results maybe less than anticipated. Significant investment risksand operational costs are associated with our exploration, development and miningactivities, such as San Bartolome and Kensington. These risks and costs may result inlower economic returns and may adversely affect our business. 13         Ourability to sustain or increase our present production levels depends in part on successfulexploration and development of new ore bodies and/or expansion of existing miningoperations. Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks andis frequently unproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of yearsuntil production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project maychange. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract metalsfrom ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processingfacilities. The economic feasibility of any development project is based upon, among otherthings, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures andother resources (such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates andcapital and operating costs of such development projects, and metals prices. Developmentprojects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance andmaintenance of necessary permits and receipt of adequate financing.         Developmentprojects, such as San Bartolome and Kensington, may have no operating history upon whichto base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Development projectitems such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to alarge extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data obtained from a limited numberof drill holes and other sampling techniques and feasibility studies. Estimates of cashoperating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to bemined and processed, the configuration of the orebody, expected recovery rates of metalsfrom the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions andother factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of any andall development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, andaccordingly, our business results of operations may be negatively affected. The Companys marketing ofmetals concentrates could be adversely affected if there were to be a significant delay ordisruption of purchases by its third party smelter customers. In particular, a significantdelay or disruption in our sales of concentrates as a result of the unexpecteddiscontinuation of purchases by our smelter customers could have a material adverse effecton our operations.         TheCompany currently markets its silver and gold concentrates to third party smelters inMexico, Japan and Australia. The loss of any one smelter customer could have a materialadverse effect on us in the event of the possible unavailability of alternative smelters.No assurance can be given that alternative smelters would be timely available if the needfor them were to arise, or that delays or disruptions in sales could not be experiencedthat would result in a materially adverse effect on our operations and our financialresults. Our silver and goldproduction may decline, reducing our revenues and negatively impacting our business.         Ourfuture silver and gold production may decline as a result of an exhaustion of reserves andpossible closure of mines. It is our business strategy to conduct silver and goldexploratory activities at our existing mining and exploratory properties as well as at newexploratory projects, and to acquire silver and gold mining properties and businesses orreserves that possess mineable ore reserves and are expected to become operational in thenear future. We can provide no assurance that our silver and gold production in the futurewill not decline. Accordingly, our revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline,negatively affecting our results of operations. There are significant hazardsassociated with our mining activities, not all of which are fully covered by insurance. Tothe extent we must pay the costs associated with such risks, our business may benegatively affected.         Themining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards,industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations,cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardousweather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of,mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmentaldamage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses andpossible legal liability. Although we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider tobe adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which event we could incursignificant costs that could adversely affect our results of operation. Insurance fullycovering many environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or otherhazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration andproduction) is not generally available to us or to other companies in the industry. Therealization of any significant liabilities in connection with our mining activities asdescribed above could negatively affect our results of operations. 14 We are subject tosignificant governmental regulations, and their related costs and delays may negativelyaffect our business.         Ourmining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws andregulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting,development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupationalhealth and safety laws and regulations including mine safety, toxic substances and othermatters related to our business. Although these laws and regulations have never requiredus to close any mine, the costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulationsare substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretationsof current laws and regulations by governmental authorities could cause additionalexpense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of our operations and delaysin the development of our properties. Moreover, governmental authorities and privateparties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resultingfrom the environmental, health and safety impacts of our past and current operations,which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties andother civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including forrestoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations.Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations,we cannot assure you that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim will nothave a negative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.         Someof our mining wastes are currently exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set offederal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations governing hazardous waste underthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). If the EPA designates these wastes ashazardous under RCRA, we would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling ofsuch wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposalfacilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to theenvironment at a mining facility, such facility may be designated as aSuperfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensationand Liability Act (CERCLA). Under CERCLA, any owner or operator of a Superfund site sincethe time of its contamination may be held liable and may be forced to undertake extensiveremedial cleanup action or to pay for the governments cleanup efforts. Additionalregulations or requirements are also imposed upon our tailings and waste disposal areas inAlaska under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and in Nevada under the Nevada WaterPollution Control Law which implements the CWA. Airborne emissions are subject to controlsunder air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada and Alaska.Compliance with CERCLA, the CWA and state environmental laws could entail significantcosts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.         Inthe context of environmental permits, including the approval of reclamation plans, we mustcomply with standards and regulations which entail significant costs and can entailsignificant delays. Such costs and delays could have a dramatic impact on our operations. We are required to obtaingovernment permits to expand operations or begin new operations. The acquisition of suchpermits can be materially impacted by third party litigation seeking to prevent theissuance of such permits. The costs and delays associated with such approvals could affectour operations, reduce our revenues, and negatively affect our business as a whole. 15         Miningcompanies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of existing operationsor for the commencement of new operations such as the Kensington development project.Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming processinvolving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costlyundertakings. The duration and success of permitting efforts are contingent on manyfactors that are out of our control. The governmental approval process may increase costsand cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted, and could causeus to not proceed with the development of a mine. Accordingly, this approval process couldharm our results of operations.         OnSeptember 12, 2005 three environmental groups filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court inAlaska against the U.S. Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Forest Service seeking toinvalidate the permit issued to Coeur Alaska, Inc. for the Companys Kensington mine. OnNovember 8, 2005, the Corps of Engineers filed a Motion for Voluntary Remand with thecourt to review the permit issued to the Company under the Clean Water Act (CWA) Section404 and requested that the court stay the legal proceeding filed by the Southeast AlaskaConservation Council (SEACC) and the other environmental groups pending the outcome ofreview. On November 12, 2005, the Federal District Court in Alaska granted the remand ofthe permit to the Corps of Engineers for further review. On November 22, 2005, the Corpsof Engineers advised the Company that it was suspending the Section 404 permit pursuant tothe Courts remand to further review the permit which was then re-instated on March29, 2006. On April 6, 2006 the lawsuit challenging the permit was re-opened, and CoeurAlaska, Inc. filed its Answer to the Amended Complaint and Motion to Intervene as aDefendant-Intervenor in the action. That motion was granted on April 25, 2006 and theCompany has joined the agencies in their defense of the permits as issued.         OnAugust 4, 2006, the Federal District Court in Alaska dismissed the Plaintiffschallenge and upheld the Section 404 permit. On August 7, 2006 the Plaintiffs filed aNotice of Appeal of the decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (CircuitCourt) and on August 9, 2006 Plaintiffs additionally filed a Motion for InjunctionPending Appeal with the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court granted a temporary injunctionpending appeal on August 24, 2006, enjoining certain activities relating to the laketailings facility. The Circuit Court further ordered an expedited briefing schedule on themerits of the legal challenge. On October 13, 2006, the parties filed their briefs in theCircuit Court and oral argument was heard on December 4, 2006. There is no indication ofwhen the Circuit Court may rule on the merits on appeal and the Company is unable topredict the outcome of this litigation or its impact on the project. Our business depends ongood relations with our employees.         TheCompany could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in productionthat could adversely affect us. As of December 31, 2006, unions represented approximately20% of our worldwide workforce. On that date, the Company had 117 employees at its CerroBayo mine and 66 employees at its Martha mine who were working under a collectivebargaining agreement. The agreement covering the Cerro Bayo mine expires on December 21,2007 and a collective bargaining agreement covering the Martha mine expires on June 11,2008. We are an internationalcompany and are exposed to risks in the countries in which we have significant operationsor interests. Foreign instability or variances in foreign currencies may cause unforeseenlosses, which may affect our  business.         Chile,Argentina, Bolivia and Australia are the most significant foreign countries in which wedirectly or indirectly own or operate mining properties or developmental projects. We alsoconduct exploratory projects in these countries. Argentina and Bolivia, while currentlyeconomically and politically stable, have experienced political instability, provincialgovernment pressures on mining operations, currency value fluctuations and changes inbanking regulations in recent years. Property ownership in a foreign country is generallysubject to the risk of expropriation or nationalization with inadequate compensation. Itis uncertain at this time how new policies may affect mining in the country. Any foreignoperations or investment may also be adversely affected by exchange controls, currencyfluctuations, taxation and laws or policies of particular countries as well as laws andpolicies of the United States affecting foreign trade investment and taxation. We mayenter into agreements which require us to purchase currencies of foreign countries inwhich we do business in order to ensure fixed exchange rates. In the event that actualexchange rates vary from those set forth in the hedge contracts, we will experience U.S.dollar-denominated currency gains or losses. Future economic or political instabilities orchanges in the laws of foreign countries in which we have significant operations orinterests and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negativelyimpact our foreign operations and our business as a whole. 16 Any of our future acquisitionsmay result in significant risks, which may adversely affect our business.         Animportant element of our business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver andgold mines, properties and businesses or interests therein. While it is our practice toengage independent mining consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, anymining properties or interests therein we may acquire may not be developed profitably or,if profitable when acquired, that profitability might not be sustained. In connection withany future acquisitions, we may incur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resultingin increased interest expense, or dilution of the percentage ownership of existingshareholders. We intend to seek shareholder approval for any such acquisitions to theextent required by applicable law, regulations or stock exchange rules. We cannot predictthe impact of future acquisitions on the price of our business or our common stock.Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities inconnection with such acquisitions, may impact the price of our common stock and negativelyaffect our results of operations. Our ability to find andacquire new mineral properties is uncertain. Accordingly, our prospects are uncertain for the future growth of our business.          Becausemines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, we are continuallyseeking to replace and expand our ore reserves. Identifying promising mining properties isdifficult and speculative. Furthermore, we encounter strong competition from other miningcompanies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable ofproducing silver and gold. Many of these companies have greater financial resources thanwe do. Consequently, we may be unable to replace and expand current ore reserves throughthe acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms we consideracceptable. As a result, our revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline,resulting in lower income and reduced growth. Third parties maydispute our unpatented mining claims, which could result in losses affecting our  business.          Thevalidity of unpatented mining claims, which constitute a significant portion of ourproperty holdings in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Althoughwe have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, we, inaccordance with mining industry practice, do not generally obtain title opinions until adecision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles toundeveloped properties, may be defective. Defective title to any of our mining claimscould result in litigation, insurance claims, and potential losses affecting our businessas a whole"
17,CDE,COEUR MINING INC,2006-03-14,"Risk Factors
         Thefollowing information sets forth information relating to important risks and uncertaintiesthat could materially adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition oroperating results. References to we, our and us inthese risk factors refer to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do notpresently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our businessoperations. Risks Relating to ourBusiness  Priorto 2005, we incurred losses due to several factors and could incur losses in the future.         Weincurred net losses in the five years prior to 2005 and had losses from continuingoperations in each of those prior periods. Factors that significantly contributed to ourlosses are:   untilrecently, historically low gold and silver market prices during those years;  ourdeliberate pursuit of a growth policy prior to 2003 calling for the acquisition of miningproperties and companies and financing such growth principally by incurring convertibleindebtedness which had a high coupon rate, thereby resulting in an interest expense of$14.6 million in 2001, $21.9 million in 2002, $12.9 million in 2003, $2.8 million in2004, and $2.5 million in 2005;   write-offs for  impaired  assets and other  holding  costs in 2000  ($12.2  million),  2001 ($6.1 million),  and 2002 ($19.0           million); and  losseson the early retirement of debt of $19.1 million in 2002, and $41.6 million in 2003.        Ifsilver and gold prices decline and we are unable to reduce our production costs, ourlosses may resume. If lower silver and gold prices make mining at our propertiesuneconomical, we may be required to recognize additional impairment write-downs, whichwould increase our operating losses and negatively impact our results of operations.  Wemay be required to incur additional indebtedness to fund our capital expenditures.         Wehave historically financed our operations through the issuance of common stock andconvertible debt, and may be required to incur additional indebtedness in the future.During 2004, we commenced construction at the San Bartolome project and in 2005 wecommenced construction at Kensington project. Construction of both projects could requirea total capital investment of approximately $325 million. While we believe that our cash,cash equivalents and short-term investments combined with cash flow generated fromoperations will be sufficient for us to make this level of capital investment, noassurance can be given that additional capital investments will not be required to be madeat these or other projects. If we are unable to generate enough cash to finance suchadditional capital expenditures through operating cash flow and the issuance of commonstock, we may be required to issue additional indebtedness. Any additional indebtednesswould increase our debt payment obligations, and may negatively impact our results ofoperations.  Inrecent years, prior to 2005, we did not have sufficient earnings to cover fixed charges,which deficiency could occur in future periods.         Asa result of our net losses prior to 2005, our earnings were not adequate to satisfy fixedcharges (i.e., interest, preferred stock dividends and that portion of rent deemedrepresentative of interest) in each of those periods prior to 2005. The amounts by whichearnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges were approximately $3.1 million in 2001,$80.8 million in 2002, $63.9 million in 2003 and $22.7 million in 2004. Earnings weresufficient to cover fixed charges in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, we are required tomake fixed payments on $180 million principal amount of our 1¼% Senior ConvertibleNotes due 2024, requiring annual interest payments of approximately $2.25 million untiltheir maturity. 9         Weexpect to satisfy our fixed charges and other expense obligations in the future from cashflow from operations and, if cash flow from operations is insufficient, from workingcapital, which amounted to approximately $285.1 million at December 31, 2005. Prior to2005, we experienced negative cash flow from operating activities. The amount of net cashused in our operating activities amounted to approximately $29.9 million in 2001, $8.5million in 2002, $5.1 million in 2003 and $18.6 million in 2004. In 2005, we generated$6.7 million of operating cash flow. The availability of future cash flow from operationsor working capital to fund the payment of interest on the notes and other fixed chargeswill be dependent upon numerous factors, including our results of operations, silver andgold prices, levels and costs of production at our mining properties and the amount of ourcapital expenditures and expenditures for acquisitions, developmental and exploratoryactivities.  Themarket prices of silver and gold are volatile. If we experience low silver and goldprices it may result in decreased revenues  and decreased net incomeor losses, and may negatively affect our business.         Silverand gold are commodities. Their prices fluctuate, and are affected by many factors beyondour control, including interest rates, expectations regarding inflation, speculation,currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metalsstockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditionsand other factors. Because we currently derive approximately 63% of our revenues fromsales of silver, our earnings are primarily related to the price of this metal.         Themarket price of silver (Handy & Harman) and gold (London Final) on February 17, 2006was $9.43 and $552 per ounce, respectively, compared with 2005s average prices forsilver and gold of $7.34 and $445, respectively. The price of silver and gold may declinein the future. Factors that are generally understood to contribute to a decline in theprice of silver include sales by private and government holders, and a general globaleconomic slowdown.         Ifthe prices of silver and gold are depressed for a sustained period and our net lossesresume, we may be forced to suspend mining at one or more of our properties until theprice increases, and record additional asset impairment write-downs. Any lost revenues,continued or increased net losses or additional asset impairment write-downs wouldadversely affect our results of operations.  Wehave recorded significant write-downs of mining properties in recent years and may haveto record  additional write-downs, which could negatively impact ourresults of operations.          Statementof Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal ofLong-Lived Assets (SFAS 144) established accounting standards for impairment of thevalue of long-lived assets such as mining properties. SFAS 144 requires a company toreview the recoverability of the cost of its assets by estimating the future undiscountedcash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.Impairment must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cashflows, and recognizing impairment write-downs has negatively impacted our results ofoperations in recent years.         Ifsilver or gold prices decline or we fail to control production costs or realize themineable ore reserves at our mining properties, we may be required to recognize furtherasset write-downs. We also may record other types of additional mining propertywrite-downs in the future to the extent a property is sold by us for a price less than thecarrying value of the property, or if liability reserves have to be created in connectionwith the closure and reclamation of a property. Additional write-downs of miningproperties could negatively impact our results of operations.  Ourrevenues and income (or loss) from our interest in the Endeavor and Broken Hill mines aredependent in part upon the performance of the operators of the mine. 10         InMay and September 2005, we acquired silver production and reserves at the Endeavor andBroken Hill mines in Australia, respectively. These mines are owned and operated by othermining companies. The Companys revenues and income (or loss) from its interest inthe silver production at these mines is dependent in part upon the performance of thoseoperators and such mines.  Theestimation of ore reserves is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimatedore reserves may not be realized in actual production. Our operating results may benegatively affected by inaccurate estimates.         Theore reserve figures presented in our public filings are estimates made by our technicalpersonnel. Reserve estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses thatrequire us to make assumptions about production costs and silver and gold market prices.Reserve estimation is an imprecise and subjective process and the accuracy of suchestimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geologicalinterpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about silver and gold market pricesare subject to great uncertainty as those prices have fluctuated widely in the past.Declines in the market prices of silver or gold may render reserves containing relativelylower grades of ore uneconomic to exploit, and we may be required to reduce reserveestimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of our properties, or writedown assets as impaired. Should we encounter mineralization or geologic formations at anyof our mines or projects different from those we predicted, we may adjust our reserveestimates and alter our mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affectour actual production and operating results.         Webased our ore reserve determinations as of December 31, 2005 on a long-term silver priceaverage of $6.50 per ounce, with the exception of the Endeavor mine which uses $7.06 perounce and the San Bartolome mine which uses $6.00 per ounce, and a long-term gold priceaverage of $410 per ounce for all properties with the exception of the Kensington propertywhich used a gold price of $375 per ounce. On February 17, 2006 silver and gold priceswere $9.43 per ounce and $552 per ounce, respectively.  Theestimation of the ultimate recovery of metals contained within the heap leach padinventory is inherently inaccurate and subjective and requires the use of estimationtechniques. Actual recoveries can be expected to vary from estimations.         TheRochester mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract silver and gold from ore. Theheap leach process is a process of extracting silver and gold by placing ore on animpermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of thecontained silver and gold, which are then recovered in metallurgical processes.         Thekey stages in the conversion of ore into silver and gold are (i) the blasting process inwhich the ore is broken into large pieces; (ii) the processing of the ore through acrushing facility that breaks it into smaller pieces; (iii) the transportation of thecrushed ore to the leach pad where the leaching solution is applied; (iv) the collectionof the leach solution; (v) subjecting the leach solution to the precipitation process, inwhich gold and silver is converted back to a fine solid; (vi) the conversion of theprecipitate into doré; and (vii) the conversion by a third party refinery of the doré intorefined silver and gold bullion.         Weuse several integrated steps to scientifically measure the metal content of ore placed onthe leach pads during the key stages. As the ore body is drilled in preparation for theblasting process, samples of the drill residue are assayed to determine estimatedquantities of contained metal. We estimate the quantity of ore by utilizing globalpositioning satellite survey techniques. We then process the ore through a crushingfacility where the output is again weighed and sampled for assaying. A metallurgicalreconciliation with the data collected from the mining operation is completed withappropriate adjustments made to previous estimates. We then transport the crushed ore tothe leach pad for application of the leaching solution. As the leach solution is collectedfrom the leach pads, we continuously sample for assaying. We measure the quantity of leachsolution with flow meters throughout the leaching and precipitation process. Afterprecipitation, the product is converted to doré, which is the final product produced bythe mine. We again weigh, sample and assay the doré. Finally, a third party smelterconverts the doré and determines final ounces of silver and gold available for sale. Wethen review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and usedthroughout the production process. Based on this review, we adjust our estimationprocedures when appropriate. 11         Ourreported inventories include metals estimated to be contained in the ore on the leach padsof $54.6 million as of December 31, 2005. Of this amount, $25.4 million is reported as acurrent asset and $29.2 million is reported as a noncurrent asset. The distinction betweencurrent and noncurrent is based upon the expected length of time necessary for theleaching process to remove the metals from the crushed ore. The historical cost of themetal that is expected to be extracted within twelve months is classified as current andthe historical cost of metals contained within the crushed ore that will be extractedbeyond twelve months is classified as noncurrent. The ore on leach pad inventory is statedat actual production costs incurred to produce and place ore on the leach pad during thecurrent period, adjusted for production issues encountered during the period.         Theestimate of both the ultimate recovery expected over time, and the quantity of metal thatmay be extracted relative to such twelve month period, requires the use of estimates whichare inherently inaccurate since they rely upon laboratory test work. Test work consists of60 day leach columns from which we project metal recoveries into the future. Thequantities of metal contained in the ore are based upon actual weights and assay analysis.The rate at which the leach process extracts gold and silver from the crushed ore is basedupon laboratory column tests and actual experience occurring over approximately nineteenyears of leach pad operation at the Rochester mine. The assumptions we use to measuremetal content during each stage of the inventory conversion process includes estimatedrecovery rates based on laboratory testing and assaying. We periodically review ourestimates compared to actual experience and revise our estimates when appropriate. Thelength of time necessary to achieve our currently estimated ultimate recoveries of between59% and 61.5% for silver, depending on the area being leached, and 93% for gold isestimated to be between 5 and 10 years. However, the ultimate recovery will not be knownuntil leaching operations cease, which is currently estimated for approximately 2011.         Whenwe began leach operations in 1986, based solely on laboratory testing, we estimated theultimate recovery of silver and gold at 50% and 80%, respectively. Since 1986, we haveadjusted the expected ultimate recovery three times (once in each of 1989, 1997 and 2003)based upon actual experience gained from leach operations. In 2003, we revised ourestimated recoveries for silver and gold of between 59% and 61.5%, depending on the areabeing leached, and 93%, respectively, which increased the estimated recoverable ounces ofsilver and gold contained in the heap by 1.8 million ounces and 41,000 ounces,respectively.         Ifour estimate of ultimate recovery requires adjustment, the impact upon our inventoryvaluation and upon our income statement would be as follows: Positive/NegativeChange in Silver RecoveryPositive/NegativeChange in Gold Recovery1%2%3%1%2%3%Quantity of recoverable              ounces   1.6 million 3.3 million 4.9 million 11,900  23,800  35,800 Positive impact on  future cost of  production per silver  equivalent ounce for  increases in recovery rates   $0.78  $1.36  $1.82       $0.36       $0.68       $0.97 Negative impact on  future cost of  production per silver  equivalent ounce for  decreases in recovery rates   $1.08  $2.70  $5.35       $0.42       $0.91       $1.48 12         Inventoriesof ore on leach pads are valued based upon actual production costs incurred to produce andplace such ore on the leach pad during the current period, adjusted for production issuesencountered during the period, less costs allocated to minerals recovered through theleach process. The costs consist of those production activities occurring at the mine siteand include the costs, including depreciation, associated with mining, crushing andprecipitation circuits. In addition, refining is provided by a third party refiner toplace the metal extracted from the leach pad in a saleable form. These additional costsare considered in the valuation of inventory. Negative changes in our inventory valuationsand correspondingly on our income statement would have an adverse impact on our results ofoperations.  Ourestimates of current and non-current inventories may not be realized in actual productionand operating results, which may negatively affect our business.         Weuse estimates, based on prior production results and experiences, to determine whetherheap leach inventory will be recovered more than one year in the future, and isnon-current inventory, or will be recovered within one year, and is current inventory. Theestimates involve assumptions that may not prove to be consistent with our actualproduction and operating results. We cannot determine the amount ultimately recoverableuntil leaching is completed. If our estimates prove inaccurate, our operating results maybe less than anticipated.  Significantinvestment risks and operational costs are associated with our exploration, developmentand mining activities, such as  San Bartolome and Kensington. Theserisks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect ourbusiness.         Ourability to sustain or increase our present production levels depends in part on successfulexploration and development of new ore bodies and/or expansion of existing miningoperations. Mineral exploration, particularly for silver and gold, involves many risks andis frequently unproductive. If mineralization is discovered, it may take a number of yearsuntil production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project maychange. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, extract metalsfrom ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processingfacilities. The economic feasibility of any development project is based upon, among otherthings, estimates of the size and grade of ore reserves, proximity to infrastructures andother resources (such as water and power), metallurgical recoveries, production rates andcapital and operating costs of such development projects, and metals prices. Developmentprojects are also subject to the completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance ofnecessary permits and receipt of adequate financing.         Developmentprojects, such as San Bartolome and Kensington, may have no operating history upon whichto base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Development projectitems such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to alarge extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data obtained from a limited numberof drill holes and other sampling techniques and feasibility studies. Estimates of cashoperating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to bemined and processed, the configuration of the orebody, expected recovery rates of metalsfrom the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions andother factors. As a result, actual cash operating costs and economic returns of any andall development projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, andaccordingly, our business results of operations may be negatively affected.  TheCompanys marketing of metals concentrates could be adversely affected if there wereto be a significant delay or disruption of  purchases by its third party smeltercustomers. In particular, a significant delay or disruption in our sales of concentratesas a  result of the unexpected discontinuation of purchases by our smelter customerscould have a material adverse effect on our  operations.         TheCompany currently markets its silver and gold concentrates to third party smelters inMexico, Japan, Australia and Canada. The loss of any one smelter customer could have amaterial adverse effect on us in the event of the possible unavailability of alternativesmelters. No assurance can be given that alternative smelters would be timely available ifthe need for them were to arise, or that delays or disruptions in sales could not beexperienced that would result in a materially adverse effect on our operations and ourfinancial results. 13  Oursilver and gold production may decline, reducing our revenues and negatively impactingour business.         Ourfuture silver and gold production may decline as a result of an exhaustion of reserves andpossible closure of mines. It is our business strategy to conduct silver and goldexploratory activities at our existing mining and exploratory properties as well as at newexploratory projects, and to acquire silver and gold mining properties and businesses orreserves that possess mineable ore reserves and are expected to become operational in thenear future. We can provide no assurance that our silver and gold production in the futurewill not decline. Accordingly, our revenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline,negatively affecting our results of operations.  Thereare significant hazards associated with our mining activities, not all of which are fullycovered by insurance. To the extent  we must pay the costs associated with such risks,our business may be negatively affected.         Themining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards,industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations,cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardousweather conditions. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of,mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmentaldamage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses andpossible legal liability. Although we maintain insurance in an amount that we consider tobe adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which event we could incursignificant costs that could adversely affect our results of operation. Insurance fullycovering many environmental risks (including potential liability for pollution or otherhazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration andproduction) is not generally available to us or to other companies in the industry. Therealization of any significant liabilities in connection with our mining activities asdescribed above could negatively affect our results of operations.  Weare subject to significant governmental regulations, and their related costs and delaysmay negatively affect our business.         Ourmining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws andregulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting,development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupationalhealth and safety laws and regulations including mine safety, toxic substances and othermatters related to our business. Although these laws and regulations have never requiredus to close any mine, the costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulationsare substantial. Possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretationsof current laws and regulations by governmental authorities could cause additionalexpense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of our operations and delaysin the development of our properties. Moreover, governmental authorities and privateparties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resultingfrom the environmental, health and safety impacts of our past and current operations,which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, penalties and other civil andcriminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring theenvironment after the closure of mines, are inherent in our operations. Although webelieve we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannotassure you that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim will not have anegative effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.         Someof our mining wastes are currently exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set offederal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations governing hazardous waste underthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). If the EPA designates these wastes ashazardous under RCRA, we would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling ofsuch wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste disposalfacilities. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to theenvironment at a mining facility, such facility may be designated as aSuperfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensationand Liability Act (CERCLA). Under CERCLA, any owner or operator of a Superfund site sincethe time of its contamination may be held liable and may be forced to undertake extensiveremedial cleanup action or to pay for the governments cleanup efforts. Additionalregulations or requirements are also imposed upon our tailings and waste disposal areas inIdaho and Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA) and in Nevada under the NevadaWater Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA. Airborne emissions are subject tocontrols under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Idaho andAlaska. Compliance with CERCLA, the CWA and state environmental laws could entailsignificant costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 14         Inthe context of environmental permits, including the approval of reclamation plans, we mustcomply with standards and regulations which entail significant costs and can entailsignificant delays. Such costs and delays could have a dramatic impact on our operations.  Weare required to obtain government permits to expand operations or begin new operations.The acquisition of such permits can be materially impacted by third party litigationseeking to prevent the issuance of such permits. The costs and delays associated withsuch approvals could affect our operations, reduce our revenues, and negatively affectour business as a whole.         Miningcompanies are required to seek governmental permits for expansion of existing operationsor for the commencement of new operations such as the Kensington development project.Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming processinvolving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costlyundertakings. The duration and success of permitting efforts are contingent on manyfactors that are out of our control. The governmental approval process may increase costsand cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted, and could causeus to not proceed with the development of a mine. Accordingly, this approval process couldharm our results of operations.         OnSeptember 12, 2005, SEACC, the Sierra Club and Lynn Canal Conservation filed a lawsuit inFederal District Court in Alaska challenging the permits issued by the Corps of Engineersand the US Forest Service and on November 8, 2005, the Corps of Engineers filed a Motionfor Voluntary Remand with the court to review the permit issued to the Company under theClean Water Act (CWA) Section 404 and requested that the court stay the legal proceedingfiled by SEACC and the other environmental groups pending the outcome of review. OnNovember 12, 2005, the Federal District Court in Alaska granted the remand of the permitto the Corps of Engineers for further review. On November 22, 2005, the Corps of Engineersadvised the Company that it was suspending the Section 404 permit pursuant to theCourts remand to further review the permit. The Company has submitted a work planwhich defines the activities at the project that are not impacted by the 404 permit or areallowable activities under the 404 permit that can continue during the suspension bythe Corps of Engineers. The Company has been continuing its drilling and explorationactivities and progressing construction pursuant to the work plan. The Company is unableto predict the impact of this suspension or litigation on the project at this time.  Ourbusiness depends on good relations with our employees.         TheCompany could experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions inproduction that could adversely affect us. As of December 31, 2005, unions representedapproximately 25% of our worldwide workforce. On that date, the Company had 157 employeesat its Cerro Bayo mine, and 147 employees at its Coeur Silver Valley mine working under acollective bargaining agreement or similar labor agreement. The Company has a collectivebargaining agreement covering the Cerro Bayo mine which expires on December 21, 2007. Thecurrent collective bargaining agreement with the Coeur Silver Valley workforce expires onSeptember 1, 2006. The Company is currently in negotiations with the workforce at theMartha mine and expects to enter into a labor agreement by the end of March 2006.  15  Weare an international company and are exposed to risks in the countries in which we havesignificant operations or interests. Foreign instability or variances in foreigncurrencies may cause unforeseen losses, which may affect our business.         Chile,Argentina, Bolivia and Australia are the most significant foreign countries in which wedirectly or indirectly own or operate mining properties or developmental projects. We alsoconduct exploratory projects in these countries. Argentina, while currently economicallyand politically stable, has experienced political instability, currency value fluctuationsand changes in banking regulations in recent years. Although the governments and economyof Chile have been relatively stable in recent years, property ownership in a foreigncountry is generally subject to the risk of expropriation or nationalization withinadequate compensation. Elections were held in Bolivia in December, 2005 resulting in anew government which is still formulating policies. It is uncertain at this time how newpolicies may affect mining in the country. Any foreign operations or investment may alsobe adversely affected by exchange controls, currency fluctuations, taxation and laws orpolicies of particular countries as well as laws and policies of the United Statesaffecting foreign trade investment and taxation. We may enter into agreements whichrequire us to purchase currencies of foreign countries in which we do business in order toensure fixed exchange rates. In the event that actual exchange rates vary from those setforth in the hedge contracts, we will experience U.S. dollar-denominated currency gains orlosses. Future economic or political instabilities or changes in the laws of foreigncountries in which we have significant operations or interests and unfavorablefluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively impact our foreignoperations and our business as a whole.  Anyof our future acquisitions may result in significant risks, which may adversely affectour business.          Animportant element of our business strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of silver andgold mines, properties and businesses. While it is our practice to engage independentmining consultants to assist in evaluating and making acquisitions, any mining propertieswe may acquire may not be developed profitably or, if profitable when acquired, thatprofitability might not be sustained. In connection with any future acquisitions, we mayincur indebtedness or issue equity securities, resulting in dilution of the percentageownership of existing shareholders. We intend to seek shareholder approval for any suchacquisitions to the extent required by applicable law, regulations or stock exchangerules. We cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of our business orour common stock. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances ofsecurities in connection with such acquisitions, may impact the price of our common stockand negatively affect our results of operations.  Ourability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain. Accordingly, ourprospects are uncertain for the future growth of our business.         Becausemines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves, we are continuallyseeking to replace and expand our ore reserves. Identifying promising mining properties isdifficult and speculative. Furthermore, we encounter strong competition from other miningcompanies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable ofproducing silver and gold. Many of these companies have greater financial resources thanwe do. Consequently, we may be unable to replace and expand current ore reserves throughthe acquisition of new mining properties on terms we consider acceptable. As a result, ourrevenues from the sale of silver and gold may decline, resulting in lower income andreduced growth.  Thirdparties may dispute our unpatented mining claims, which could result in losses affectingour business.         Thevalidity of unpatented mining claims, which constitute a significant portion of ourproperty holdings in the United States, is often uncertain and may be contested. Althoughwe have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, we, inaccordance with mining industry practice, do not generally obtain title opinions until adecision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles toundeveloped properties, may be defective. Defective title to any of our mining claimscould result in litigation, insurance claims, and potential losses affecting our businessas a whole.  Ifpreviously  announced control findings re-occur,  or if we experience other similarissues, our ability to report our  financial  results in an accurate and timely mannercould be materially  adversely  impacted,  which could cause  investors to lose confidence  in our  financial  reports and  negatively  impact our business and theprice of our common stock.         Asdisclosed in our  recently-filed  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December31, 2005 (the 2005 10-K), our management  concluded that, as of December 31, 2005, ourdisclosure  controls and procedures were effective  and  our  internal  control  over financial  reporting  was  effective,  and  this  assessment  of  the effectiveness ofour internal  control over financial  reporting was audited by KPMG LLP, as stated intheir report appearing  therein.  However,  in our  previously-filed  Annual Report onForm 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004  (the  2004  10-K),  managements report  and the  report  of KPMG LLP on  managements  assessment  of the effectiveness of internal  control over  financial  reporting as of December 31, 2004 expressed anopinion that we did not  maintain  effective  internal  control  over  financial reporting  as of December 31, 2004 because of the effect of certain  material weaknesses.  We believe we have  implemented  actions that addressed the issues raisedby KPMG LLP in their  report.  In  addition,  on March 10, 2006 we filed an amendment  toour  Quarterly  Report on Form 10-Q for the  quarterly  period  ending March 31, 2005, to reflect that  management  had  concluded  that our disclosure  controls and procedures  were not  effective as of March 31, 2005.  Such  conclusion  was based onour identification  of a material  weakness  with regard to the controls over our calculation  of the ore on leach pad inventory at our Rochester  operation.  Subsequentto March 31, 2005, we implemented  remediation  measures as part of our ongoing effort toimprove our internal  controls over financial  reporting,  which we believe hasremediated this  material  weakness  prior to December  31, 2005.If these issues re-occur, or if similar issues re-occur, our ability toreport our financial  results in an accurate and timely manner could be materially adversely  impacted,  which could cause  investors to lose  confidence in our financial reports and negatively impact our business. 16"
