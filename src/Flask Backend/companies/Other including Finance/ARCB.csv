7,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2024-02-23,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS​Our business is subject to a variety of material risks about which we are aware. We could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. This Risk Factors
 section discusses the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry and our Company that are largely out of our control. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occur, it could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows; impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled; and/or result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.​Risks Related to Significant Unusual Events​The effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or disease or any other public health crisis, as well as regulatory measures implemented in response to such events, could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees and/or adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​The widespread outbreak of illness, disease, or emergence of another public health crisis, as we experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, may, in the future, negatively impact our business, including operational efficiencies and demand for our services. Future measures intended to prevent the spread of a health epidemic, including regulatory measures and our efforts and costs incurred to comply with them, could negatively impact our operational efficiency and that of our third-party capacity providers, as well as our customers’ demand for our services. Additionally, if a high number of our employees were to contract a virus, disease or illness or were quarantined, our operations and customer service levels and, consequently, our results of operations, could be adversely impacted. We do not have insurance coverage specific to losses resulting from a pandemic. In the event of another pandemic or other public health crisis that adversely affects the U.S. and global economies, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted, and many of the other risks discussed in this Risk Factors
 section may be heightened.​We, or the third parties who provide services for us, may be adversely affected by external events for which our business continuity plans may not adequately prepare us.​The occurrence of severe weather, natural disasters, health epidemics, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars and Red Sea crisis), trade restrictions, and other adverse external events or conditions that impact us or the operations of third parties who provide services for us have the potential to significantly impact our ability to conduct business. Although we have business continuity plans in place, there is no guarantee that our plans have adequately addressed each known risk or every possible risk and can be successfully or timely implemented. Even if we were to successfully implement our continuity plans, we may incur substantial expenses and there is no guarantee that our business, financial condition, and results of operations will not be materially impacted.​Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Information Technology ​We depend on our Information Technology (“IT”) systems, and a systems failure, perceived or actual data privacy breach, or cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We depend on the proper functioning, availability, and security of our IT systems, including communications, data processing, financial, and operating systems, as well as proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. Our IT systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; power loss; telecommunications failures; terrorist attacks; internet failures and other disruptions to technology, including 20Table of Contentscomputer viruses; and other events beyond our control, including cybersecurity incidents such as denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees or vendors with access to our systems or data, phishing, disruption by malware, or attacks enabled by AI. Any significant failure or other disruption in our critical IT systems that impacts the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that results in proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others, being compromised could have a significant impact on our business, interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, result in violation of privacy laws, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​New or enhanced technology that we develop and implement may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and may be more prone to related incidents. We also utilize certain third-party software applications; provide underlying data to third parties; grant access to certain of our systems to third parties who provide certain services; and increasingly store and transmit data with our customers and third parties by means of connected IT systems, any of which may increase the risk of a data privacy breach or other cybersecurity incident. Any problems caused by or impacting these third parties, including cybersecurity attacks and security breaches at a vendor, could result in claims, litigation, losses and/or liabilities and materially adversely affect our ability to provide service to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. ​A portion of our employee population operates under remote and hybrid work arrangements, which has increased demand for IT resources and our exposure to cybersecurity risks, including an increased risk of social engineering attempts, such as phishing, unauthorized access to proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, and other cybersecurity incidents. As AI capabilities improve and are increasingly adopted, we may see cybersecurity attacks perpetrated through AI. While we maintain property and cyber insurance, losses arising from a significant disaster or cyber incident may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Although we have implemented measures to mitigate our exposure to the heightened risks of cybersecurity incidents, we cannot be certain that such measures will be effective to prevent a cybersecurity incident from materializing.​We have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service attacks, malware attacks, and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. To our knowledge, the various protections we have employed have been effective to date in identifying these types of events at points when the impact on our business could be minimized. Despite our efforts to monitor and develop our IT networks and infrastructure, due to the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and the development of new techniques for attack, we may be unable to anticipate, promptly detect, or timely implement adequate protective or remedial measures against cybersecurity attacks or recover use of our IT networks and infrastructure timely.​We engage third parties to provide certain IT needs, including licensed software, and the inability to maintain these third-party systems or licenses, or any interruptions or failures thereof, could adversely affect our business.​Certain of our IT needs are provided or supported by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The IT systems and operations of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, security breaches, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our IT platforms rely, or in other third-party services upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide. Such disruptions or failures could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that provide critical support for our operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.​We rely on the suitability of the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls maintained by our third-party software providers and obtain related assurance reports from independent service auditors engaged by our third-party software providers for all in-scope systems. However, we cannot ensure that controls identified by our third-party software providers are adequate to prevent, detect or correct misstatements in processing or reporting transactions, or to adequately limit or eliminate system or operational vulnerabilities.​21Table of ContentsIf we are unable to timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology or processes, or if we fail to realize the potential benefits thereof, we may suffer competitive disadvantage, loss of customers, or other consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​The industry has experienced, and will likely continue to experience, rapid changes in technology, including the development of new technology, the deployment of emerging technology, such as generative AI and machine learning, and enhancements in existing technology. With industry advancements in technology, our customers may find alternatives to our services to meet their freight transportation and logistics needs. New entrants to the market, including start-ups and emerging business models which are often technology-centric or technology-enabled, have also expanded the field of competition and driven an increased pressure for innovation in the industry.​Technology and new market entrants may also disrupt the way we, and our competitors, operate to provide freight logistics services. We expect our customers will continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions from their suppliers, including advancements in processes, equipment, and facilities to address concerns over business efficiency, supply chain effectiveness, and climate change. To improve efficiencies and meet our customers’ needs, we have made, and continue to make, significant investments in the enhancement of existing technology and in the development of new and innovative solutions, such as software and physical assets that are in various stages of development and implementation. Among other initiatives, our investments in technology include VauxTM and our equity investment in Phantom Auto, as further described in “Technology” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A number of factors will be involved in determining proof of concept, and there can be no assurance that our technology implementations, including Vaux and remote-operated equipment, will be successful. Furthermore, investments in start-up companies, by their nature, involve risk which may subject our investment to risk of loss.​Our efforts and investments in technology innovation may continue to require significant ongoing research and development costs and implementation costs and may involve new or unforeseen risks and challenges, including heightened risks for data and information security, privacy, protection, and copyright infringement and, in the case of generative AI, potential compliance gaps in an emerging but fragmented regulatory environment. The success of our approach to technology innovation depends on market acceptance of our solutions and a number of other factors, including our ability to:●deploy funds and resources for investment in technology and innovation; ●achieve the right balance of strategic investments in existing or developing technology and innovation;●timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology, including integration into current operations and interaction with existing systems; ●train our employees to operate the technology and/or achieve appropriate customer, carrier or other desired user adoption of the technology; ●adequately anticipate challenges and respond to unforeseen challenges; ●detect and remedy defects in enhanced or new technology; and●recover costs of investment through increased business levels, higher prices, improved efficiencies or other means, such as licensing or disposing of the developed technology.​If we do not pursue technological advances or engage in innovation, if we fail to successfully or timely develop and deploy enhanced or new technology, or if any enhanced or new technology does not yield the results we expect, or is developed by others, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage; lose customers; incur higher than anticipated costs, including the possible impact of asset impairment or the write-off of software development costs; or fail to meet the goals of our internal growth strategy, any one of which could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.​Risks Related to Our Business​The loss of or reduction in business from one or more large customers, or an overall reduction in our customer base, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Although we do not have a significant customer concentration, the growth of our business could be materially impacted and our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if we were to lose all or a portion of the business of some of our large customers. Such loss may occur if our customers choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to our competitors; demand pricing concessions for our services; require us to provide enhanced services at lower prices; or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities. Our customer relationships are generally not subject to 22Table of Contentslong-term contractual obligations or minimum volume commitments, and we cannot ensure that our current customer relationships will continue at the same business levels or at all. A reduction in our customer base or difficulty in collecting, or the inability to collect, payments from our customers due to changes in pricing, economic hardship, or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Our initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful.​Developing our service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.​Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel, and we may not be able to hire, train, upskill, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. We have incurred increased costs associated with long-term investment in the development of our owner-operator fleet and contract carrier capacity for our Asset-Light segment. As we focus on growing our Asset-Light segment, we may also encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments, which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors and in which we will encounter new competitive challenges, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.​We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels or changing market demands, as portions of salaries, wages, and benefits are fixed in nature and the adjustments that would otherwise be necessary to align the labor cost structure to corresponding business levels are limited as we strive to maintain customer service. It is more difficult to match our staffing levels and purchased transportation resources to our business needs in periods of rapid or unexpected change, which we have experienced in recent years. We may, in the future, incur additional costs related to purchased transportation and/or experience labor inefficiencies in training new employees who are hired in response to growth. If such additional costs are disproportionate to our business levels, they may adversely impact our operating results. A prolonged labor shortage or significant labor inefficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as a result of lower levels of service, including timeliness, productivity and/or quality of service. We regularly evaluate and modify the network of our Asset-Based operations to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile the segment’s infrastructure with tonnage and shipment levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that any given network change will result in a material improvement in our Asset-Based segment’s results of operations.​We may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of acquisitions within the expected time period or at all. The cost, integration, and performance of any such acquisition may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or earnings from the operations of MoLo, which we acquired on November 1, 2021, or any future acquired business, to offset our acquisition or investment costs, and the acquired business may otherwise fail to meet our operational or strategic expectations. Difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support an acquisition, could prevent us from realizing the full anticipated benefits, and within the anticipated timeframe, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future.​The possible risks involved in acquisitions include, among others:●potential loss of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers; ●difficulties synchronizing operations of the companies, including the integration of workforces, while continuing to provide consistent, high-quality service to customers; ●unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of IT, communications, and other systems, including additional systems training and other labor inefficiencies; ●potentially unacceptable qualification requirements for contract carriers or other third-party vendors;23Table of Contents●potentially unfavorable, or adverse changes to, pre-existing contractual relationships;●delays in consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; ●difficulties and costs of synchronizing our policies, procedures, business culture, and benefits and compensation programs; ●inability to apply and maintain our internal controls and comply with regulatory requirements; ●difficulties related to additional or unanticipated regulatory and compliance issues; ●adverse tax consequences associated with the acquisition; and●other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities, including previously unknown liabilities, or legal proceedings which may arise, associated with the acquired business for which we have no, or are unable to secure, recourse under applicable indemnification or insurance provisions.​We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The complex and time-consuming processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks that may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Future acquisitions, if any, may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities, which may negatively impact our capitalization and financial position. Further, we may not be able to acquire businesses or assets in the future, or acquire them on terms favorable to us, even though we may have incurred expenses in evaluating and pursuing strategic transactions.​Unsolicited takeover proposals, proxy contests and other proposals/actions by activist investors may distract management and adversely affect our business and the market price and lead to pronounced volatility in the price of our common stock.​We could become subject to unfavorable advances by investor activists or receive unsolicited takeover proposals at an undervalued stock price. In the event that a third party makes an unsolicited takeover proposal or otherwise attempts to gain control of our Company, our review and consideration of such proposals may be a significant distraction for our management and may require us to expend significant time and resources away from our primary operations. Such proposals may disrupt our business by causing uncertainty among current and potential employees, customers and other stakeholders, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction also may adversely affect the market price and lead to pronounced volatility in the price of our common stock.​Damage to our corporate reputation may cause our business to suffer.​Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of our brands. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived, and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers’ image of our brands, including ArcBest, ABF Freight, Panther, MoLo, and U-Pack, and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, social and sustainability issues, and similar matters, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Despite our efforts to adapt to and address these concerns and concerns over AI impacting brand reputations, our efforts may be insufficient. Additionally, the implementation of initiatives, including our sustainability initiatives, may increase our costs. It is difficult to predict how our efforts with respect to sustainability matters will be evaluated by current and prospective investors or by our customers or business partners, and our industry may be generally disfavored by the investing community at large.​Our business is increasingly dependent on the internet for attracting and securing customers, and the possibility that fraudulent behavior may confuse or deceive customers, including through use of AI, heightens the risk of damage to our reputation and increases the time and expense required to protect and maintain the integrity of our brands. With the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity, even when based upon incorrect information or false statements, can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and, thus, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our stock, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.​24Table of ContentsOur corporate reputation and business depend on a variety of intellectual property rights, and the costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our rights or to defend against infringement claims could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We have registered or are pursuing registration of various marks and designs as trademarks in the United States, including, but not limited to, “ArcBest,” “ABF Freight,” “Panther,” “MoLo,” “U-Pack,” “Vaux,” and “More Than Logistics.” For some marks, we also have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service or trade names, logos, or designs similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. We have obtained or are pursuing patent protection on internally developed and certain purchased technology, including equipment and process patents in connection with Vaux. Competitors or other third parties could attempt to reproduce or reverse-engineer our patented technologies, or we could be subject to third-party claims of infringement. Any of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property, whether owned or licensed, could be challenged or invalidated, or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our efforts to obtain, enforce, or protect our proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party infringement claims, may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.​Risks Related to Our Industry​A nationwide or global disruption in the supply chain could increase volatility in freight volumes and materially impact our business.​Our business may be materially impacted by the cyclical nature of the supply chain industry due to changes in consumer spending related to inflation and higher interest rates and, more recently, due to disruption to two crucial trade corridors – the Panama Canal as a result of low rain levels and the Suez Canal as a result of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, among other challenges affecting our industry. Although there have been recent signs of normalizing in the manufacturing capacity of original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), we have experienced, and may continue to experience, an inability to obtain, or delays in the delivery of, equipment necessary for operations, including tractors, trailers, and other equipment, as a result of manufacturing delays, supply chain disruptions, parts shortages, and equipment design changes due to upcoming federal and/or state emissions standards. The extent to which we are vulnerable to and may be negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions is uncertain and dependent upon the duration and severity of supply shortages as well as other factors beyond our control, such as extreme weather events, natural disasters, cybersecurity breaches, geopolitical conflicts, or government shutdowns. Supply chain disruptions have and may continue to have a significant impact on consumer prices, demand, and bottlenecks in production, which may negatively impact our freight volume, operating costs, and ability to serve our customers.​We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address factors that could affect our profitability, growth prospects, and ability to compete in the transportation and logistics market.​We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. We compete with LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. We also compete with domestic and global logistics service providers, including asset-light logistics companies, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers that compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry.​Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The competitive factors material to our business are the following:●Our Asset-Based segment competes primarily with nonunion motor carriers who generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure than union carriers for freight-handling and driving personnel and have greater operating flexibility because they are subject to less-stringent labor work rules. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact the operating results of our Asset-Based segment relative to our competitors in the LTL industry.●Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select 25Table of Contentstransportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels.●Enhanced visibility of capacity options in the marketplace is increasing, and customers may seek bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may generally depress prices or result in the loss of some business to our competitors.●In an excess capacity market, we may be unable to maintain the higher market-driven prices we obtained for our services in the tighter capacity environment, especially if there is a prolonged recessionary period in the freight environment as there was during 2023. As market capacity tightens, customer demand may exceed available carrier capacity in the industry as experienced through the second half of 2022.●Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.●Customers are increasingly focused on environmental concerns, including emissions, and may select transportation providers that are able to reduce emissions more readily or effectively through efficiency improvements to existing and emerging technologies, adoption of alternative fuels or through carbon offsetting mechanisms.●Shippers may choose to build their own logistics capabilities reducing or eliminating need for these services from our Asset-Based segment.​Additionally, as the retail industry continues its trend toward increases in e-commerce at an unprecedented rate, the manner in which our customers source or utilize our services will continue to evolve. If we are unable to successfully adapt and implement appropriate measures in response to these changes, our operating results could be adversely affected.​Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, equipment, including new revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.​In recent years, OEMs have significantly raised the prices of equipment, including new revenue equipment, due to supply chain disruptions and other challenges beyond our control, including, but not limited to geopolitical conflicts and significant weather events, in addition to increased costs of materials and labor, above normal inflation levels, and high interest rates, which impact equipment financing. Manufacturers have also raised prices, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies as described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. GHG emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations as well as fuel costs. Additional state-mandated emission-control requirements could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner-operators for portions of our Asset-Light segment operations, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices, which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry, which could lead to or exacerbate a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.​We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations, which may be difficult to procure in the event of decreased supply or other supply chain disruptions. From time to time, some OEMs of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. For example, significant shortages of semiconductor chips, as experienced through the first half of 2023, and other component parts and supplies, including steel, have forced and may continue to force manufacturers to curtail or suspend their production, leading to a lower supply of tractors and trailers, higher prices, and lengthened trade cycles. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change.​When market forces result in demand outstripping supply, we have and may continue to face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs for new tractors or trailers, as well as related parts and services, for our Asset-Based operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth initiatives, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​26Table of ContentsFuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, or the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters; armed conflicts; terrorist attacks; actions by producers, including a decrease in drilling activity or the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production; legislation or regulations that require or result in new or alternate uses or other increases in the demand for fuel traditionally used by trucks; or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil and diesel, political events, military conflicts, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes that are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.​Additionally, we pay independent contractor drivers a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause the fuel surcharge we pay to independent contractors to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs, which could adversely impact the results of operations of our Asset-Light segment.​Our Asset-Based segment and certain operations of our Asset-Light segment assess a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts the total billed revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment measure and, consequently, our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to the corresponding decline in our fuel costs, as experienced in 2023.​Risks Related to Employees and Benefits​Difficulty attracting, retaining and upskilling employees throughout the Company, or if ABF Freight is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, could result in labor inefficiencies, disruptions, stoppages, or delayed growth.​During recent years, we experienced, and continue to experience in certain markets, challenges with hiring an adequate number of qualified drivers, freight-handlers, and professional personnel to meet increases in demand due to numerous factors. With the exception of the market disruption experienced in 2023 due to the shutdown of a large LTL competitor, the available pool of drivers has been declining in recent years, which has caused and may in the future cause difficulty in retaining and hiring qualified drivers. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions that result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow. The expansion of flexible work options triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has also provided more employment opportunities for those in professional roles, including our IT roles, making attraction and retention more complex. If wage inflation continues for noncontractual professional roles, our labor costs will increase. If we encounter difficulty in attracting, retaining, and upskilling employees, including qualified drivers, freight-handlers, and professional personnel, we could incur higher recruiting expenses or a loss of business, and our profitability and ability to grow could be adversely affected.​As of December 2023, approximately 82% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the 2023 ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT that will remain in effect through June 30, 2028. If we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs. There can be no assurance that our future collective bargaining agreements will be renewed on terms favorable to us. The terms of any future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may also result in higher labor costs, insufficient operational flexibility, which may increase our operating costs, a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash 27Table of Contentsflows. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages.​We could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.​ABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. These multiemployer plans, established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed and cover collectively bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan in a relatively short period of time pursuant to an agreement. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan.​The multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight’s obligations to these plans are generally specified in the 2023 ABF NMFA and other related supplemental agreements, as further discussed in Note K to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These pension plans provide the best retirement benefits in the industry. However, when compared to competitors, ABF Freight pays some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry and continues to address the effect of the Asset-Based segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results in discussions with the IBT. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. Future contribution rates will be determined through the negotiation process for contract periods following the term of the current collective bargaining agreement.​Certain legislative actions that became effective in recent years include provisions to improve funding for multiemployer pension plans, as further discussed in Note K to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, despite such legislative actions, we may still trigger withdrawal liability through, among other things, mergers and other fundamental corporate transactions and, as a result of operational changes, site closures and job losses. We continue to monitor the impact these legislative actions have on the funding status of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes; however, we cannot determine with any certainty the minimum contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements or the impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.​Risks Related to Third Parties​We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships.​A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth or higher shipment levels, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers, which could result in loss of business or customer loyalty. In addition, third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations, revenues, profitability and customer relationships.​28Table of ContentsOur ability to secure the services of third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control, including unfavorable pricing conditions; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner-operators and drivers of contracted carriers for our Asset-Light segment; shortages in available cargo capacity of third parties; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in government regulations affecting the transportation industry and their related impact on operations, such as hours-of-service rules and the ELD mandate; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our Asset-Light segment.​In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with the operations of our Asset-Light segment, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are owner-operators, independent contractors, or employees working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents or incidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries including death. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in contracting with them initially or retaining them over time. We or our subsidiaries could be held directly responsible for these third-party claims and, regardless of ultimate liability, may incur significant costs and expenses in defending these claims or through settlements, even in cases where we believe we have meritorious claims or defenses. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims, or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all.​Our engagement of independent contractor drivers to provide a portion of the capacity for our Asset-Light segment exposes us to different risks than we face with our employee drivers.​The driver fleet for portions of our Asset-Light segment is made up of independent owner-operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner-operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner-operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner-operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in owner-operator compensation, our services may be less competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as these independent owner-operators and individuals are third-party service providers, rather than our employees, they may decline loads of freight from time to time, which may impede our ability to deliver freight in a timely manner or result in increased expenses to do so.​If the independent contractors with which we contract are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, or if we experience operational or regulatory issues related to our use of these contract drivers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​Class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in the transportation and logistics industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. Many states have enacted restrictive laws that make it difficult to successfully prove independent-contractor status, and all states have enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors. In the event of such reclassification of our owner-operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest and under vicarious liability principles.​Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters​We are subject to litigation risks, and at times may need to initiate litigation, which could result in significant costs and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including class-action litigation and other legal proceedings brought by customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties, related to labor and employment, including wage and hour claims; competitive matters; personal injury; property damage; cargo claims; safety and contract compliance; environmental liability; and other matters, such as the matters (if any) described in Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) included in Part I of, or otherwise disclosed in, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities, including damages, fines, penalties, and substantial legal and related costs, that may result from these claims and litigation. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by 29Table of Contentsinsurance or could impact our cost of, and ability to obtain, insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort from our management team. Further, because of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings.​We establish reserves based on our assessment of known legal matters and contingencies. New legal claims, or subsequent developments related to known legal claims, asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.​Our business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations in the transportation industry, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Various international, federal, state and local agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, and the costs to comply with such regulations could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can result in penalties, revocation of our permits or licenses, or both civil and criminal actions against us. In addition to the potential harm to our reputation and brands, the financial burdens resulting from such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Failures by us, or our contracted owner-operators and third-party carriers, to comply with the various applicable federal safety laws and regulations, or downgrades in our safety rating, could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, and could cause us to lose customers, as well as the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs, or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage.​Our Asset-Light segment utilizes third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulatory requirements. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our Asset-Light segment. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in governmental or third-party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to address or remedy, violations by them.​We are also subject to stringent and changing privacy laws, regulations and standards as well as policies, contracts and other obligations related to data privacy, including customer and employee data. As a provider of worldwide transportation and logistics services, we collect and process significant amounts of customer data on a daily basis. In recent years, there have been global efforts by governments and consumer groups for increased transparency in how customer data is utilized and how customers and employees can control the use and storage of their data. Complying with existing or new data protection laws and regulations may increase our compliance costs or require us to modify our data handling practices. Non-compliance could result in governmental or consumer actions against us and even perceived non-compliance may otherwise adversely impact our reputation, operating results and financial condition. The uncertainty of the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, and their increasing scope and complexity, create regulatory risks that will likely increase over time. Additionally, if third parties or others violate obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security, such violations may also put our customers’ or employees’ information at risk and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business.​30Table of ContentsOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.​We routinely transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives. At certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel and oil in underground and aboveground tanks and other containers. In connection with these operations, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other areas: emission controls, transportation of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil. We may be subject to substantial fines, civil penalties, or litigation if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required environmental inspections and testing provisions. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any clean-up costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities, including those occurring prior to ownership or use of such facilities, and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles.​The transportation of hazardous materials or explosives also involves the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, a spill or accident involving hazardous substances, and hazardous waste disposal. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of these operations, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury.​Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to clean-up costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other GHG emissions, and some form of federal, state, and/or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. Emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions may require changes in our operating practices, impair equipment productivity, or require additional reporting disclosures. Compliance with laws and regulations related to climate risk may also increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. We may also encounter difficulties in collecting and managing data that impact timely compliance or incur significant costs to comply with increased regulation regarding environmental monitoring and financial reporting disclosure requirements, including those signed into law in October 2023 under California Senate Bill 253 Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and California Senate Bill 261 Climate-Related Financial Risk Act, as described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are subject to increasing investor and customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to shareholder proposals, customer-led initiatives, or our customers’ efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure, business, or results of operations.​Risks Related to Financial Considerations​We are subject to interest rate risk and certain covenants under our financing arrangements. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations could impact the availability of funds or our borrowing costs.​We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets, which from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our borrowings on the accounts receivable securitization program (“A/R Securitization”) and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) under our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $50.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2024, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our A/R Securitization, new notes payable or finance lease arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including inflation, governmental monetary 31Table of Contentspolicies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. See Note I to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.​Our Credit Agreement and A/R Securitization contain customary financial covenants and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. Failing to achieve certain required financial ratios could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.​If we default under the terms of the Credit Agreement or our A/R Securitization and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. An event of default under either of these facilities could constitute automatic default on the other facility and could trigger cross-default provisions in our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or A/R Securitization, the lender of the A/R Securitization could proceed against the collateral by which that facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or one or both of the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if one or both of the facilities is terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be favorable or acceptable. A default under the Credit Agreement or A/R Securitization, changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds or our borrowing costs, or our inability to renew our financing arrangements with terms that are acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.​Our business is capital intensive. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, our growth and profitability could be limited due to significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.​Our business requires significant capital expenditures, which we finance through various sources, including cash flows from operations, borrowings under our revolving credit facility or our accounts receivable securitization program, and notes payable. We continue to invest significantly in our revenue equipment fleet. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash over an extended period of time from operations to fund our capital requirements, we may have to limit our growth, including our ability to invest in technological initiatives that drive business efficiencies; utilize our existing liquidity or enter into additional financing arrangements, including leasing arrangements; or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods resulting in increased maintenance costs, any of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.​Claims expenses, the cost of maintaining our insurance, or the loss of our ability to self-insure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​Claims may be asserted against us for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation related to accidents or events occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize, for our actions in retaining their services, for loss or damage to our customers’ goods or other damages for which we are alleged or may be determined to be responsible. Such claims against us and associated costs and legal expenses may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or our established reserves, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results.​We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss and damage claims for the operations of our Asset-Based segment and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase, and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of 32Table of Contentsinsurance coverage. Our self-insurance program for third-party automobile casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if we were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking/logistics sector, our insurance costs or collateral requirements could materially increase, or we could experience difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. In recent years, many insurance companies have completely stopped offering coverage to trucking and logistics companies or have significantly reduced the amount of coverage they offer or have significantly raised premiums or retention levels as a result of increases in the severity of automobile liability claims and sharply higher costs of settlements and verdicts. Our insurance premiums, deductibles, and self-insurance retention levels, which are discussed in “Insurance” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, have increased and could further increase in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. The impact of climate change, including its effect on weather-related events which may disrupt our operations or damage our property and equipment, may increase our claims liabilities and the cost to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our business. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty liability. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future, which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements.​Future impairment, if any, of our long-lived assets and our goodwill and intangible assets could adversely affect our earnings.​Long-lived assets, including operating right-of-use assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Determination that certain long-lived assets are no longer needed for the strategic growth of our business may result in significant impairment charges, such as those incurred during the third quarter of 2023 as certain long-lived operating right-of-use assets were made available for sublease. See Note C and Note H to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our lease-related impairment charges.​Our goodwill and intangible assets are primarily associated with acquisitions in the Asset-Light segment. Our annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2023, 2022, and 2021 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances; however, there can be no assurance that an impairment will not occur in the future.​Given the uncertainties regarding the economic environment, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of impairment evaluations and accounting estimates will prove to be accurate. Significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions, or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of our reporting units, could result in impairment and noncash write-off of a significant portion of our long-lived assets, goodwill, and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Risks Related to Other External Conditions ​We are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control.​Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions, which can be impacted by government actions, including changes in tax laws, suspension of government operations and imposition of trade tariffs. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, inflation, labor and supply shortages, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices, which may be impacted by factors such as higher inflation and interest rates. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case primarily in the North 33Table of ContentsAmerican economy, and capacity in the trucking industry as well as our customers’ inventory levels and freight profile characteristics. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight and related pricing in the markets we serve. Further changes to U.S. or international trade policy or other global trade impacts could result in increased cost for goods transported globally, which may lead to reduced consumer demand, or trading partners could limit trades with countries that impose anti-trade measures, which may lead to a lower volume of global economic trading activity. International security concerns, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, Red Sea crisis, and other geopolitical tensions, and potential actions or retaliatory measures taken in respect thereof, could continue to have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic activity.​Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which may adversely affect the profit margin for our services. If we are unable to respond timely and effectively to changes in the pricing environment or if our strategies for customer retention and margin optimization are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our operations and the rates we obtain for our services may also be negatively impacted when economic conditions lead to a decrease in shipping demand, which in turn results in excess equipment capacity in the industry. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Conversely, during times of higher shipping demand, tight market capacity may negatively impact the service levels we are able to provide to our customers.​Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, which could negatively impact our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend unsecured credit to these customers, which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.​Inflation and high interest rates may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.​Inflation in the United States was at its highest level in 40 years by the end of June 2022 and has remained above normal and historical levels throughout 2023 and into 2024. Significant inflation can adversely impact our financial condition by increasing interest rates and the cost of equipment. Most of our operating expenses are sensitive to increases in inflation, including fuel, insurance, employee wages and benefits, purchased transportation, and depreciation due to higher equipment prices. Further, inflation may generally increase costs for materials, supplies, services, and capital. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to secure adequate price increases for our services to offset the increases in our operating costs, which could reduce our operating margins. Additionally higher inflation and interest rates could impact consumer demand, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results as tonnage and shipment levels decrease.​Our business and results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and climate change.​Our operations are, and may in the future be, impacted by seasonal fluctuations and, at times, inclement weather conditions that affect employee working conditions, tonnage and shipment levels, demand for our services, and operating costs, which in turn may impact our revenues and operating results, as further described in “Seasonality” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions. Severe weather events and natural disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or third-party service providers, damage existing infrastructure, destroy our assets, affect regional economies, or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, any of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results.​​34Table of Contents"
8,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2023-02-24,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS​Our business is subject to a variety of material risks about which we are aware. We could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. This Risk Factors
 section discusses the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry and our Company that are largely out of our control. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occur, it could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows; impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled; and/or result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.​Risks Related to Union Relations​If ABF Freight is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​As of December 2022, approximately 82% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT that will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. Contract negotiations for the period subsequent to June 30, 2023 are expected to begin in late first quarter or early second quarter 2023. The negotiation of terms of the collective bargaining agreement is a very complex process. There can be no assurance that our future collective bargaining agreements will be renewed on terms favorable to us.  The terms of any future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may also result in higher labor costs, insufficient operational flexibility, which may increase our operating costs, a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages.​Risks Related to Significant Unusual Events​The effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other public health crisis, as well as regulatory measures implemented in response to such events, could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees and/or adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Our business has been and, in the future, may be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of illness, disease, or emergence of another public health crisis, as we experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures intended to prevent the spread of a health epidemic, including regulatory measures and our efforts and costs incurred to comply with them, could negatively impact our operational efficiency and our customers’ demand for our services in the future and, therefore, have an adverse effect on our business.​The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, economic activity and conditions worldwide, creating significant volatility and disruption to financial markets. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 led governments and other authorities to impose restrictions that have resulted in business closures and disrupted supply chains worldwide. Our operations and those of our customers and third-party capacity providers were subject to these supply chain disruptions to varying degrees due to pandemic-related plant and port shutdowns, transportation delays, government actions, and other factors. The global shortage of certain components, strains on production or extraction of raw materials, record cost inflation, and labor and equipment shortages could escalate in future periods. If a high number of our employees were to contract COVID-19 or another disease or illness or were quarantined, our operations and customer service levels, and, consequently, our results of operations, could be adversely impacted. We do not have insurance coverage specific to losses resulting from a pandemic.​In the event of worsening conditions in the severity and spread of COVID-19 or another pandemic or other public health crisis that adversely affects the U.S. and global economies, our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely impacted, and many of the other risks discussed in this Risk Factors
 section may be heightened.​20Table of ContentsWe, or the third parties who provide services for us, may be adversely affected by external events for which our business continuity plans may not adequately prepare us.​The occurrence of severe weather, natural disasters, health epidemics, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts (such as the war between Russia and Ukraine), and other adverse external events or conditions that impact us or the operations of third parties who provide services for us have the potential to significantly impact our ability to conduct business. Although we have business continuity plans in place, including an emergency succession plan, there is no guarantee that our plans have adequately addressed each risk and can be successfully implemented. Even if we were to successfully implement our continuity plans, we may incur substantial expenses and there is no guarantee that our business, financial condition, and results of operations will not be materially impacted.​Risks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Information Technology ​We are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure, perceived or actual data privacy breach, or cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We depend on the proper functioning, availability, and security of our information technology (“IT”) systems, including communications, data processing, financial, and operating systems, as well as proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. Our IT systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; power loss; telecommunications failures; terrorist attacks; internet failures and other disruptions to technology, including computer viruses; and other events beyond our control, including cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents such as denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees or vendors with access to our systems or data, or disruption by malware. Any significant failure or other disruption in our critical IT systems that impacts the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that results in proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others, being compromised could have a significant impact on our business, interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, result in violation of privacy laws, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. ​New or enhanced technology that we develop and implement may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and may be more prone to related incidents. We also utilize certain third-party software applications; provide underlying data to third parties; grant access to certain of our systems to third parties who provide certain services; and increasingly store and transmit data with our customers and third parties by means of connected IT systems, any of which may increase the risk of a data privacy breach or other cybersecurity incident. Any problems caused by or impacting these third parties, including cyberattacks and security breaches at a vendor, could result in claims, litigation, losses and/or liabilities and materially adversely affect our ability to provide service to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. ​A significant portion of our employee population operates under remote and hybrid work arrangements, which may increase demand for IT resources and our exposure to cybersecurity risks, including an increased risk of phishing, unauthorized access to proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, and other cybersecurity attacks. Although we have implemented measures to mitigate our exposure to the heightened risks associated with working remotely through our technology security programs, we cannot be certain that such measures will be effective to prevent a cybersecurity incident from materializing. While we maintain property and cyber insurance, losses arising from a significant disaster or cyber incident may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. ​We have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service attacks, malware attacks, and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. To our knowledge, the various protections we have employed have been effective to date in identifying these types of events at points when the impact on our business could be minimized. Despite our efforts to monitor and develop our IT networks and infrastructure, due to the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and the development of new techniques for attack, we may be unable to anticipate or promptly detect, or implement adequate protective or remedial measures against, cybersecurity attacks.​21Table of ContentsWe engage third parties to provide certain information technology needs, including licensed software, and the inability to maintain these third-party systems or licenses, or any interruptions or failures thereof, could adversely affect our business. ​Certain of our IT needs are provided or supported by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our IT systems depends upon the internet, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers. The IT systems of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our IT platforms rely, or in other third-party services upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide. Such disruptions or failures could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that provide critical support for our operations. There is no guarantee that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.​If we are unable to timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology or processes, or if we fail to realize the potential benefits thereof, including the pilot test program at ABF Freight and our investment in human-centered remote operation software, we may suffer competitive disadvantage, loss of customers, or other consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.​The industry has experienced, and will likely continue to experience, rapid changes in technology, including the development of new technology and enhancements in existing technology. As technology improves, our customers may find alternatives to our services to meet their freight transportation and logistics needs. New entrants to the market, including start-ups and emerging business models which are often technology-centric or technology-enabled, have also expanded the field of competition and driven an increased pressure for innovation in the industry.  ​Technology and new market entrants may also disrupt the way we, and our competitors, operate to provide freight logistics services. We expect our customers will continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions from their suppliers, including advancements in processes, equipment, and facilities to address concerns over business efficiency, supply chain effectiveness, and climate change. To improve efficiencies and meet our customers’ needs, we have made, and continue to make, significant investments in the enhancement of existing technology and in the development of new and innovative solutions, such as software and physical assets that are in various stages of development and implementation. We began investing in human-centered remote operation software in 2021 as further described in “Technology” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our investments in technology also include a pilot test program we began in 2019 to improve freight handling at ABF Freight as further described in “Asset-Based Segment” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A number of factors will be involved in determining proof of concept for the pilot test program, and there can be no assurance that our technology implementations, including the pilot and our remote operation software implementation, will be successful.​Our efforts and investments in technology innovation may continue to require significant ongoing research and development costs and implementation costs and may involve new or unforeseen risks and challenges associated with the technology. The success of our approach to technology innovation is dependent upon market acceptance of our solutions and a number of other factors, including our ability to:​●deploy funds and resources for investment in technology and innovation; ●achieve the right balance of strategic investments in existing or developing technology and innovation;●timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology, including integration into current operations and interaction with existing systems; ●train our employees to operate the technology and/or achieve appropriate customer, carrier or other desired user adoption of the technology; ●adequately anticipate challenges and respond to unforeseen challenges; ●detect and remedy defects in enhanced or new technology; and●recover costs of investment through increased business levels, higher prices, improved efficiencies or other means, such as licensing or disposing of the developed solution.​22Table of ContentsIf we do not pursue technological advances or engage in innovation, if we fail to successfully or timely develop and deploy enhanced or new technology, or if any enhanced or new technology does not yield the results we expect, or is developed by others, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage; lose customers; incur higher than anticipated costs, including the possible impact of asset impairment or the write-off of software development costs; or fail to meet the goals of our internal growth strategy, any one of which could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.​Risks Related to Our Business​The loss of or reduction in business from one or more large customers, or an overall reduction in our customer base, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Although we do not have a significant customer concentration, the growth of our business could be materially impacted, and our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if we were to lose all or a portion of the business of some of our large customers. Such loss may occur if our customers choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors; demand pricing concessions for our services; require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs; or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities. Our customer relationships are generally not subject to long-term contractual obligations or minimum volume commitments, and we cannot ensure that our current customer relationships will continue at the same business levels or at all. A reduction in our customer base or difficulty in collecting, or the inability to collect, payments from our customers due to changes in pricing, economic hardship or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Our initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful.​Developing our service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, including the acquired operations of MoLo, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.​Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel, and we may not be able to hire, train, upskill, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. Hiring new employees has resulted in an increase in our training costs and caused temporary labor inefficiencies, which may continue with future hiring initiatives. We have incurred increased costs associated with long-term investment in the development of our owner operator fleet and contract carrier capacity for our ArcBest segment. As we focus on growing our ArcBest segment, we may also encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments, which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors and in which we will encounter new competitive challenges, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.​We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels or changing market demands, as portions of salaries, wages, and benefits are fixed in nature and the adjustments that would otherwise be necessary to align the labor cost structure to corresponding business levels are limited as we strive to maintain customer service. It is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in periods of rapid or unexpected change, such as those we experienced in 2022. Our Asset-Based segment has incurred higher purchased transportation costs and experienced labor inefficiencies due to labor shortages and the training of newly hired employees during 2021 and 2022. We may, in the future, incur additional costs related to purchased transportation and/or experience labor inefficiencies in training new employees who are hired in response to growth. If such additional costs are disproportionate to our business levels, they may adversely impact our operating results. A prolonged labor shortage or significant labor inefficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as a result of lower levels of service, including timeliness, productivity and/or quality of service. We regularly evaluate and modify the network of our Asset-Based operations to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile the segment’s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that any given network change will result in a material improvement in our Asset-Based segment’s results of operations.​23Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any recent or future acquisitions within the expected time period or at all. The cost, integration, and performance of any such acquisition may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​As part of our strategy to expand our revenue opportunities and achieve a more balanced business mix, we acquired MoLo on November 1, 2021. The acquired truckload brokerage operation of MoLo has been included in our ArcBest operating segment and resulted in growth of our Asset-Light operations. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or earnings from the operations of MoLo, or any future acquired business, to offset our acquisition or investment costs, and the acquired business may otherwise fail to meet our operational or strategic expectations. Difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support an acquisition, could prevent us from realizing the full anticipated benefits, and within the anticipated timeframe, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future.​The possible risks involved in recent or future acquisitions include, among others:​●potential loss of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers; ●difficulties synchronizing operations of the companies, including the integration of workforces, while continuing to provide consistent, high-quality service to customers; ●unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of IT, communications, and other systems, including additional systems training and other labor inefficiencies; ●potentially unacceptable qualification requirements for contract carriers or other third-party vendors;●potentially unfavorable, or adverse changes to, pre-existing contractual relationships;●delays in consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; ●difficulties and costs of synchronizing our policies, procedures, business culture, and benefits and compensation programs; ●inability to apply and maintain our internal controls and compliance with regulatory requirements; ●difficulties related to additional or unanticipated regulatory and compliance issues; ●adverse tax consequences associated with the acquisition; and●other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities, including previously unknown liabilities, or legal proceedings which may arise, associated with the acquired business for which we have no, or are unable to secure, recourse under applicable indemnification or insurance provisions.​We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The complex and time-consuming processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks that may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Future acquisitions, if any, may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities, which may negatively impact our capitalization and financial position. Further, we may not be able to acquire any additional companies at all or on terms favorable to us, even though we may have incurred expenses in evaluating and pursuing strategic transactions.​Damage to our corporate reputation may cause our business to suffer.​Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of our brands. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers’ image of our brands, including ArcBest, ABF Freight, FleetNet America, Panther, MoLo, and U-Pack, and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, ESG issues, and similar matters, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Despite our efforts to adapt to and address these concerns, our efforts may be insufficient, and our industry may be generally disfavored by the investing community at large. Additionally, the implementation of initiatives, including our ESG initiatives, which are detailed on our website, may increase our costs. It is difficult to predict how our efforts with respect to social and sustainability matters will be evaluated by current and prospective investors or by our customers or business partners. ​24Table of ContentsOur business, including the self-service moving offerings provided under our U-Pack brand, is increasingly dependent on the internet for attracting and securing customers, and the possibility that fraudulent behavior may confuse or deceive customers heightens the risk of damage to our reputation and increases the time and expense required to protect and maintain the integrity of our brands. With the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity, even when based upon incorrect information or false statements, can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and, thus, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.​Our corporate reputation and business depend on a variety of intellectual property rights, and the costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our rights or to defend against infringement claims could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We have registered or are pursuing registration of various marks and designs as trademarks in the United States, including, but not limited to, “ArcBest,” “ABF Freight,” “FleetNet America,” “Panther,” “MoLo,” “U-Pack,” and “More Than Logistics.” For some marks, we also have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service or trade names or logos or designs similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. We have obtained or are pursuing patent protection on internally developed and certain purchased technology, including equipment and process patents in connection with the previously disclosed pilot test program at ABF Freight. Competitors or other third parties could attempt to reproduce or reverse-engineer our patented technologies, or we could be subject to third-party claims of infringement. Any of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property, whether owned or licensed, could be challenged or invalidated, or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our efforts to obtain, enforce, or protect our proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party infringement claims, may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. ​Risks Related to Our Industry​A nationwide or global disruption in the supply chain could increase volatility in freight volumes and materially impact our business.​Our business may be materially impacted by the cyclical nature of the supply chain industry which has been exacerbated due to an ongoing shortage of truck drivers, material scarcity, port and rail congestion, digital transformation, and changes in consumer spending due to record inflation and rising interest rates, among other challenges following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, an inability to obtain, or delays in the delivery of, equipment necessary for operations, including tractors, trailers, and other equipment, as a result of manufacturing delays, supply chain disruptions, and parts shortages. The extent to which we are vulnerable to and may be negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions is uncertain and dependent upon the duration and severity of labor and supply shortages as well as other factors beyond our control, such as extreme weather events, natural disasters, cybersecurity breaches or government shutdowns. Supply chain disruptions have and may continue to have a significant impact on consumer prices, demand, and bottlenecks in production, which may negatively impact our freight volume, operating costs, and ability to serve our customers.​We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address factors that could affect our profitability, growth prospects, and ability to compete in the transportation and logistics market.​We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. We compete with LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. We also compete with domestic and global logistics service providers, including asset-light logistics companies, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers that compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The competitive factors material to our business are the following:​25Table of Contents●Our Asset-Based segment competes primarily with nonunion motor carriers who generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure than union carriers for freight-handling and driving personnel and have greater operating flexibility because they are subject to less-stringent labor work rules. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors have allowed for a lower cost structure than that of our Asset-Based segment. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact the operating results of our Asset-Based segment relative to our competitors in the LTL industry.●Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels.●Enhanced visibility of capacity options in the marketplace is increasing and customers may seek bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may generally depress prices or result in the loss of some business to our competitors.●In a tight capacity market, as experienced in the first half of 2022, customer demand may exceed available carrier capacity in the industry. When market capacity loosens, as occurred in the second half of 2022, we may be unable to maintain the favorable prices we obtained for our services in the tighter capacity environment, especially if there is a prolonged recessionary period.●Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.●Customers are increasingly focused on concerns related to climate change and they may select transportation providers that are able to reduce emissions through efficiency improvements to existing and emerging technologies, adoption of alternative fuels or through carbon offsetting mechanisms.●Our FleetNet operations also face challenges, and could suffer loss of business, due to companies that choose to insource their fleet repair and maintenance services.​Additionally, as the retail industry continues its trend toward increases in e-commerce, the manner in which our customers source or utilize our services will continue to evolve. If we are unable to successfully adapt and implement appropriate measures in response to these changes, our operating results could be adversely affected.​Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.​In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to inflation, increased demand for or decreased supply of such equipment, parts shortages, manufacturing disruptions, and increased costs of materials and labor. Manufacturers have also raised prices, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. GHG emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations as well as fuel costs. Additional state-mandated emission-control requirements could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner operators for portions of our ArcBest segment operations, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices, which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry, which could lead to or exacerbate a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  ​We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations, which may be difficult to procure in the event of decreased supply or other supply chain disruptions. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. For example, significant shortages of semiconductor chips and other component parts and supplies, including steel, have forced and may continue to force manufacturers to curtail or suspend their production, leading to a lower supply of tractors and trailers, higher prices, and lengthened trade cycles. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. Our total capital expenditures for 26Table of Contents2021 and, to a lesser extent, 2022 were reduced due to parts shortages and manufacturing disruptions of OEMs. As a result, a portion of our previously planned capital expenditures for 2021 and 2022 carried over into our 2022 and 2023 investment plans, respectively. When market forces result in demand outstripping supply, we have and may continue to face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs for new tractors or trailers, as well as related parts and services, for our Asset-Based operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth initiatives, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters; armed conflicts; terrorist attacks; actions by producers, including a decrease in drilling activity or the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production; legislation or regulations that require or result in new or alternate uses or other increases in the demand for fuel traditionally used by trucks; or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil and diesel, political events, military conflicts, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes that are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.​Our Asset-Based segment and certain operations of our ArcBest segment assess a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts the total billed revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment measure and, consequently, our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to the corresponding decline in our fuel costs. ​Risks Related to Employees and Benefits​If we have difficulty attracting, retaining and upskilling employees throughout the Company, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​During recent years, we experienced, and continue to experience in certain markets, challenges with hiring an adequate number of qualified drivers, freight-handlers, and professional personnel to meet increases in demand due to numerous factors, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, prevailing wage rates, health and other insurance costs, and inflation. The available pool of drivers has been declining, which has caused and may continue to cause us more difficulty in retaining and hiring qualified drivers and other personnel. The expansion of flexible work options triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic has also provided more employment opportunities for those in professional roles, including our IT roles, making attraction and retention more complex. Both our profitability and our ability to grow could be adversely affected if we encounter difficulty in attracting, retaining, and upskilling employees, including qualified drivers, freight-handlers and professional personnel, if we become subject to contractually required increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs, or if wage inflation continues for noncontractual professional roles. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions that result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the Company. If we are unable to continue to attract, retain, and upskill qualified employees, including drivers, we could incur higher recruiting expenses or a loss of business. ​We could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.​ABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. These multiemployer plans, established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed and cover collectively bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension 27Table of Contentsplans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan in a relatively short period of time pursuant to an agreement. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan. ​The multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. Many of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded, as further discussed in Note J to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. ABF Freight’s obligations to these plans are generally specified in the 2018 ABF NMFA and other related supplemental agreements. These pension plans provide the best retirement benefits in the industry. However, when compared to competitors, ABF Freight pays some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry and continues to address the effect of the Asset-Based segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results in discussions with the IBT. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. Future contribution rates will be determined through the negotiation process for contract periods following the term of the current collective bargaining agreement.​Certain legislative actions which include provisions to improve funding for multiemployer pension plans became effective during 2021 and 2022, as further discussed in Note J to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, despite such legislative actions, we may still trigger withdrawal liability through, among other things, mergers and other fundamental corporate transactions and, as a result of operational changes, site closures and job losses. We continue to monitor the impact these legislative actions have on the funding status of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes; however, we cannot determine with any certainty the minimum contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements or the impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.  ​Risks Related to Third Parties​We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships.​A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth or higher shipment levels, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations, revenues, profitability and customer relationships.​Our ability to secure the services of third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control, including unfavorable pricing conditions; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators and drivers of contracted carriers for our ArcBest segment; shortages in available cargo capacity of third parties; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in government regulations affecting the transportation industry and their related impact on operations, such as hours-of-service rules and the ELD mandate; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our ArcBest segment. 28Table of Contents​In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with the operations of our ArcBest segment, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are owner operators, independent contractors, or employees working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents or incidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries including death. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in contracting with them initially or retaining them over time. We or our subsidiaries could be held directly responsible for these third-party claims and, regardless of ultimate liability, may incur significant costs and expenses in defending these claims or through settlements, even in cases where we believe we have meritorious claims or defenses. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims, or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all.​Our engagement of independent contractor drivers to provide a portion of the capacity for our ArcBest segment exposes us to different risks than we face with our employee drivers. If we have difficulty in securing independent owner operators, or if we incur increased costs to utilize independent owner operators, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​The driver fleet for portions of our ArcBest segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in owner operator compensation, our services may be less competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as these independent owner operators and individuals are third-party service providers, rather than our employees, they may decline loads of freight from time to time, which may impede our ability to deliver freight in a timely manner. If we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our ArcBest segment.​Additionally, we pay independent contractor drivers a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause the fuel surcharge we pay to independent contractors to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs, which could adversely impact the results of operations of our ArcBest segment.​If the independent contractors with which we contract are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, or if we experience operational or regulatory issues related to our use of these contract drivers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​Class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in the transportation and logistics industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. Many states have enacted restrictive laws that make it difficult to successfully prove independent-contractor status, and all states have enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors. In the event of such reclassification of our owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest and under vicarious liability principles. Such liabilities and costs, to the extent they arise, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our ArcBest segment.​Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters​We are subject to litigation risks, and at times may need to initiate litigation, which could result in significant costs and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including class-action litigation and other legal proceedings brought by customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties, related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental 29Table of Contentsliability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities, including damages, fines, penalties, and substantial legal and related costs, that may result from these claims and litigation. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost of, and ability to obtain, insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort from our management team. Further, because of the potential risks, expenses, and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings. ​We establish reserves based on our assessment of known legal matters and contingencies. New legal claims, or subsequent developments related to known legal claims, asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Also see Item 3 (Legal Proceedings) included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for disclosure of a legal matter for which we believe a loss, that could be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, is reasonably possible.​Our business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations in the transportation industry, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. ​Various international, federal, state and local agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, and the costs to comply with such regulations could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can result in penalties, revocation of our permits or licenses, or both civil and criminal actions against us. In addition to the potential harm to our reputation and brands, the financial burdens resulting from such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Failures by us, or our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with the various applicable federal safety laws and regulations, or downgrades in our safety rating, could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, and could cause us to lose customers, as well as the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs, or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage.​Our ArcBest segment utilizes third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulatory requirements. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, or if we experience a shortage of quality third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations, there could be a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our ArcBest and FleetNet segments. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in governmental or third-party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to address or remedy, violations by them.​We are also subject to stringent and changing privacy laws, regulations and standards as well as policies, contracts and other obligations related to data privacy, including customer and employee data. As a provider of worldwide transportation and logistics services, we collect and process significant amounts of customer data on a daily basis. In recent years, there have been global efforts by governments and consumer groups for increased transparency in how customer data is utilized and how customers and employees can control the use and storage of their data. Complying with existing or new data protection laws and regulations may increase our compliance costs or require us to modify our data handling practices. Non-compliance could result in governmental or consumer actions against us and even perceived non-compliance may otherwise adversely impact our reputation, operating results and financial condition. The uncertainty of the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, and their increasing scope and complexity, create regulatory risks that will likely increase over time. Additionally, if third parties or others violate obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security, such violations may also put our customers’ or employees’ information at risk and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business.​30Table of ContentsOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.​We routinely transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives, and, at certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel and oil in underground and aboveground tanks and other containers. In connection with these operations, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other areas: emission controls, transportation of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil. We may be subject to substantial fines, civil penalties, or third-party initiated lawsuits if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required environmental inspections and testing provisions. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any clean-up costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles.​The transportation of hazardous materials or explosives also involves the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, a spill or accident involving hazardous substances, and hazardous waste disposal. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of these operations, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury.​Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to clean-up costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other GHG emissions, and some form of federal, state, and/or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. Emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions may require changes in our operating practices, impair equipment productivity, or require additional reporting disclosures. Compliance with laws and regulations related to climate risk may also increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. We may also incur significant costs to comply with increased regulation regarding environmental monitoring and reporting requirements. We are subject to increasing investor and customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to shareholder proposals, customer-led initiatives, or our customers’ efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure, business, or results of operations.​Risks Related to Financial Considerations​We are subject to interest rate risk and certain covenants under our financing arrangements. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds, or our borrowing costs could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.​We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our borrowings on the accounts receivable securitization program (“A/R Securitization”) and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) under our Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $50.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2023, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our A/R Securitization, new notes payable or finance lease arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including inflation, governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit 31Table of Contentscommitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.​Our Credit Agreement and A/R Securitization contain customary financial covenants and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. Failing to achieve certain required financial ratios could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.​If we default under the terms of the Credit Agreement or our A/R Securitization and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. An event of default under either of these facilities could constitute automatic default on the other facility and could trigger cross-default provisions in our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or A/R Securitization, the lender of the A/R Securitization could proceed against the collateral by which that facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or one or both of the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if one or both of the facilities is terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be favorable or acceptable. A default under the Credit Agreement or A/R Securitization, changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds or our borrowing costs, or our inability to renew our financing arrangements with terms that are acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.​Our business is capital intensive. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, our growth and profitability could be limited due to significant ongoing capital expenditure requirements.​We depend on cash flows from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility or our A/R Securitization, and operating and financing leases to fund our capital expenditures. We continue to invest significantly in our revenue equipment fleet, which helps us reduce our maintenance costs and has resulted in the Company having one of the newest fleets on the road. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash over an extended period of time from operations to fund our capital requirements, we may have to limit our growth, including our ability to invest in technological initiatives that drive business efficiencies; utilize our existing liquidity or enter into additional financing arrangements, including leasing arrangements; or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods resulting in increased maintenance costs, any of which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.​Claims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance, including medical plans, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​Claims may be asserted against us for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation related to accidents or events occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize, for our actions in retaining their services, for loss or damage to our customers’ goods or other damages for which we are alleged or may be determined to be responsible. Such claims against us and associated costs and legal expenses may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or our established reserves, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. ​We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss and damage claims for the operations of our Asset-Based segment and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase, and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage. Our self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if we were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave 32Table of Contentsthe trucking sector, our insurance costs or collateral requirements could materially increase, or we could experience difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. In recent years, several insurance companies have completely stopped offering coverage to trucking companies or have significantly reduced the amount of coverage they offer or have significantly raised premiums as a result of increases in the severity of automobile liability claims and sharply higher costs of settlements and verdicts. Our insurance premiums or deductibles could increase in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. The impact of climate change, including its effect on weather-related events which may disrupt our operations or damage our property and equipment, may increase our claims liabilities and the cost to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our business. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty liability. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future, which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements. ​Future impairment, if any, of our goodwill and intangibles could adversely affect our earnings.​Our goodwill and intangible assets are primarily associated with acquisitions in the ArcBest segment. As of December 31, 2022, we had recorded goodwill of $305.4 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $113.8 million. Our annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022, 2021, and 2020 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances; however, there can be no assurance that an impairment will not occur in the future.​Given the uncertainties regarding the economic environment, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of impairment evaluations and accounting estimates will prove to be accurate. Significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions, including insufficient cash flows from acquired operations, or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of our reporting units, could result in impairment and noncash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Risks Related to Other External Conditions ​We are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions, which can be impacted by government actions, including suspension of government operations and imposition of trade tariffs. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, inflation, labor and supply shortages, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case primarily in the North American economy, and capacity in the trucking industry as well as our customers’ inventory levels and freight profile characteristics. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight and related pricing in the markets we serve. Further changes to U.S. or international trade policy or other global trade impacts could result in increased cost for goods transported globally, which may lead to reduced consumer demand, or trading partners could limit trades with countries that impose anti-trade measures, which may lead to a lower volume of global economic trading activity. International security concerns, including the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions, and potential actions or retaliatory measures taken in respect thereof, could continue to have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic activity.​Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which may adversely affect the profit margin for our services. Our operations and the rates we obtain 33Table of Contentsfor our services may also be negatively impacted when economic conditions lead to a decrease in shipping demand, which in turn results in excess equipment capacity in the industry. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Conversely, during times of higher shipping demand, tight market capacity may negatively impact the service levels we are able to provide to our customers. Demand for our roadside assistance and fleet maintenance management services may also decline in a weaker economic environment when customers of our FleetNet segment experience declines in their equipment utilization or delay maintenance needs.  ​Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, which could negatively impact our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend unsecured credit to these customers, which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.​Inflation and rising interest rates may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.​Inflation in the United States was at its highest level in 40 years by the end of June 2022 and although the inflation rate slowed slightly during the second half of 2022, it remains above market forecasts as of January 2023. Significant inflation can adversely impact our financial condition by increasing interest rates and the cost of equipment. Most of our operating expenses are sensitive to increases in inflation, including fuel, insurance, employee wages and benefits, purchased transportation, and depreciation due to higher equipment prices. Further, inflation may generally increase costs for materials, supplies, services, and capital. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to secure adequate price increases for our services to offset the increases in our operating costs, which could reduce our operating margins.​Our business and results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and climate change.​Our operations are, and may in the future be, impacted by seasonal fluctuations and, at times, inclement weather conditions that affect tonnage and shipment levels, service events, demand for our services, and operating costs, which in turn may impact our revenues and operating results, as further described in “Seasonality” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions. Severe weather events and natural disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or third-party service providers, damage existing infrastructure, destroy our assets, affect regional economies, or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, any of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results.​​"
3,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2022-02-25,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS​Our business is subject to a variety of material risks about which we are aware. We could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. This Risk Factors
 section discusses the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry and our Company that are largely out of our control. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occur, it could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows; impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled; and/or result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.​Risks Related to Significant Unusual Events​The effects of a widespread outbreak of an illness or disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other public health crisis, as well as regulatory measures implemented in response to such events, could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees and/or adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Our business has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of another illness, disease, or public health crisis in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide and created significant volatility and disruption to financial markets. Measures intended to prevent the spread of a health epidemic, including regulatory measures and our efforts to comply with them, could also have an adverse effect on our business.​Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 led governments and other authorities to impose restrictions that have resulted in business closures and disrupted supply chains worldwide. Our operations and those of our customers and third-party capacity providers have been subject to these supply chain disruptions due to pandemic-related plant and port shutdowns, transportation delays, government actions and other factors. The global shortage of certain components, strains on production or extraction of raw materials, cost inflation, and labor and equipment shortages, could escalate in future quarters. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to prevent its spread, including our costs to comply with any regulation, could negatively impact our operational efficiency and our customers’ demand for our services in the future. ​We have experienced declines in our productivity as a result of positive COVID-19 cases in certain locations. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we cannot be certain that we will not experience disruptions to our operations in the future due to regulatory requirements, quarantines, or positive COVID-19 cases among our employees. If a high number of our employees were to contract COVID-19, our operations and customer service levels, and, consequently, our results of operations, could be adversely impacted.​The extent of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our employees is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the duration, transmissibility, and severity of variants and government actions in response to the pandemic. Extended periods of economic disruption and high inflation and resulting declines in industrial production and manufacturing, consumer spending, and demand for our services, as well as the ability of our customers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and heighten many of the other risks discussed in this Risk Factors
 section. ​We, or the third parties who provide services for us, may be adversely affected by external events for which our business continuity plans may not adequately prepare us.​The occurrence of severe weather, natural disasters, health epidemics, acts of war or terrorism, military conflicts (such as the rising geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine), and other adverse external events or conditions that impact us or the operations of third parties who provide services for us have the potential to significantly impact our ability to conduct business. Although we have business continuity plans in place, including an emergency succession plan, there is no guarantee that our plans can be successfully implemented. Even if we were to successfully implement our continuity plans, we may incur substantial expenses and there is no guarantee that our business, financial condition, and results of operations will not be materially impacted.​20Table of ContentsRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, and Information Technology ​We are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure, perceived or actual data privacy breach, or cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We depend on the proper functioning, availability and security of our information technology (“IT”) systems, including communications, data processing, financial, and operating systems, as well as proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. Our IT systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control, including cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents such as denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees or vendors with access to our systems or data, or disruption by malware. Any significant failure or other disruption in our critical IT systems that impacts the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that results in proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others, being compromised could have a significant impact on our business, interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. ​Any new or enhanced technology that we may develop and implement may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and may be more prone to related incidents. We also utilize certain software applications provided by third parties; provide underlying data to third parties; grant access to certain of our systems to third parties who provide certain services; and increasingly store and transmit data with our customers and third parties by means of connected IT systems, any of which may increase the risk of a data privacy breach or other cybersecurity incident. Any problems caused by or impacting these third parties, including cyber attacks and security breaches at a vendor, could result in claims, litigation, losses and/or liabilities and materially adversely affect our ability to provide service to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. ​In response to the health and safety risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, we transitioned a significant portion of our employee population to remote work arrangements in 2020, and many of our employees continue to work remotely, which may increase our exposure to cybersecurity risks, including an increased demand for IT resources, increased risk of phishing, and other cybersecurity attacks. Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the heightened risk, we cannot be certain that such measures will be effective to prevent a cybersecurity incident from materializing. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks through our technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent such risks. While we maintain property and cyber insurance, losses arising from a significant disaster or cyber incident would likely exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We do not have insurance coverage specific to losses resulting from a pandemic.​We have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service attacks, malware attacks, and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. To our knowledge, the various protections we have employed have been effective to date in identifying these types of events at a point when the impact on our business could be minimized. Despite our efforts to monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure, due to the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and the development of new techniques for attack, we may be unable to anticipate or promptly detect, or implement adequate protective or remedial measures against, the activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks.​We engage third parties to provide certain information technology needs, including licensed software, and the inability to maintain these third-party systems or licenses, or any interruptions or failures thereof, could adversely affect our business. ​Certain of our information technology needs are provided by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our IT systems depends upon the internet, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers. The IT systems of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, 21Table of Contentsinternet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our IT platforms rely, or in other third-party services upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide. Such disruptions or failures could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that provide critical support for our operations. We have no guarantees that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. ​If we are unable to timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology or processes, or if we fail to realize potential benefits thereof, including the pilot test program at ABF Freight, we may suffer competitive disadvantage, loss of customers, or other consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.​The industry has experienced rapid changes in technology, including the development of new technology and enhancements in existing technology. As technology improves, our customers may be able to find alternatives to our services to meet their freight transportation and logistics needs. New entrants to the market, including start-ups and emerging business models such as digital freight brokerage platforms, have also expanded the field of competition and driven an increased pressure for innovation in the industry.  ​Technology and new market entrants may also disrupt the way we, and our competitors, operate to provide freight logistics services. We expect our customers will continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions from their suppliers, including advancements in processes, equipment, and facilities to address concerns over climate change. We believe we must respond by investing in the enhancement of existing technology and in the development of new and innovative solutions to improve efficiencies and meet our customers’ needs. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments in software and physical assets that are in various stages of development and implementation. These investments include a pilot test program we began in early 2019 to improve freight handling at ABF Freight as further described in “Asset-Based Segment” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A number of factors will be involved in determining proof of concept and there can be no assurances that pilot testing will be successful or expand beyond current testing locations.​Our efforts and investments in technology innovation may continue to require significant ongoing research and development costs and implementation costs and may involve new or unforeseen risks and challenges associated with the technology. The success of our approach to technology innovation is dependent upon market acceptance of our solutions and a number of other factors, including our ability to:​●deploy funds and resources for investment in technology and innovation; ●achieve the right balance of strategic investments in existing or developing technology and innovation;●timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology, including integration into current operations and interaction with existing systems; ●train our employees to operate the technology and/or achieve appropriate customer, carrier or other desired user adoption of the technology; ●adequately anticipate challenges and respond to unforeseen challenges; ●detect and remedy defects in enhanced or new technology; and●recover costs of investment through increased business levels, higher prices, improved efficiencies or other means.​If we do not pursue technological advances or engage in innovation, if we fail to successfully or timely develop and deploy enhanced or new technology, or if any enhanced or new technology does not yield the results we expect, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage; lose customers; incur higher than anticipated costs, including the possible impact of asset impairment or the write-off of software development costs; or fail to meet the goals of our internal growth strategy, any one of which could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.​22Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Business​The loss of or reduction in business from one or more large customers, or an overall reduction in our customer base, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Although we do not have a significant customer concentration, the growth of our business could be materially impacted and our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if we were to lose all or a portion of the business of some of our large customers. Such loss may occur if our customers choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors; demand pricing concessions for our services; require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs; or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities. Our customer relationships are generally not subject to long-term contractual obligations or minimum volume commitments, and we cannot ensure that our current customer relationships will continue at the same business levels or at all. A reduction in our customer base or difficulty in collecting, or the inability to collect, payments from our customers due to changes in pricing, economic hardship or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Our initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful.​Developing service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, including the acquired operations of MoLo, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.​Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel, and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. Hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary labor inefficiencies. We have also incurred increased costs associated with long-term investment in the development of our owner operator fleet and contract carrier capacity for our ArcBest segment. As we focus on growing the business in our ArcBest segment, we may also encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments, which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors and in which we will encounter new competitive challenges, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.​We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels or changing market demands, as portions of salaries, wages, and benefits are fixed in nature and the adjustments that would otherwise be necessary to align the labor cost structure to corresponding business levels are limited as we strive to maintain customer service. It is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in periods of rapid or unexpected change. Our Asset-Based segment has incurred higher purchased transportation costs and experienced labor inefficiencies due to labor shortages and training of newly hired employees during a period of increased demand that followed a period of significantly lower shipment volumes due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the second quarter of 2020. We may, in the future, incur additional costs related to purchased transportation and/or experience labor inefficiencies in training new employees who are hired in response to growth. Incurring additional labor and/or purchased transportation costs which are disproportionate to our business levels will adversely impact our operating results. A prolonged labor shortage or significant labor inefficiencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Additionally, labor shortages and increased labor costs can result in lower levels of service, including timeliness, productivity and quality of service. We periodically evaluate and modify the network of our Asset-Based operations to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile the segment’s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that any given network change will result in a material improvement in our Asset-Based segment’s results of operations.​23Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any recent or future acquisitions within the expected time period or at all. The cost, integration, and performance of any such acquisition may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​As part of our strategy to expand our revenue opportunities and achieve a more balanced business mix, we acquired MoLo Solutions, LLC (“MoLo”) on November 1, 2021. The acquired truckload brokerage operation of MoLo has been included in our ArcBest operating segment and resulted in growth of our Asset-Light operations. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or earnings from the operations of MoLo, or any future acquired business, to offset our acquisition or investment costs, and the acquired business may otherwise fail to meet our operational or strategic expectations. Difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support an acquisition, could prevent us from realizing the full anticipated benefits, and within the anticipated timeframe, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future. ​The possible risks involved in recent or future acquisitions include, among others:​●potential loss of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers; ●difficulties synchronizing operations of the companies, including the integration of workforces, while continuing to provide consistent, high-quality service to customers; ●unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information technology, communications, and other systems, including additional systems training and other labor inefficiencies; ●potentially unacceptable qualification requirements for contract carriers;●potentially unfavorable pre-existing contractual relationships;●delays in consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; ●difficulties and costs of synchronizing our policies, procedures, business culture, and benefits and compensation programs; ●inability to apply and maintain our internal controls and compliance with regulatory requirements; ●difficulties related to additional or unanticipated regulatory and compliance issues; ●adverse tax consequences associated with the acquisition; and●other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities, including previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no, or are unable to secure, recourse under applicable indemnification or insurance provisions.​We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The complex and time-consuming processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks that may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Future acquisitions, if any, may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities, which may negatively impact our capitalization and financial position. Further, we may not be able to acquire any additional companies at all or on terms favorable to us, even though we may have incurred expenses in evaluating and pursuing strategic transactions.​Damage to our corporate reputation may cause our business to suffer.​Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of our brands. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers’ image of our brands, including ArcBest, ABF Freight, MoLo, Panther Premium Logistics, FleetNet America, and U-Pack, and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues, and similar matters, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Despite our efforts to adapt to and address these concerns, our efforts may be insufficient, and our industry may be generally disfavored by the investing community at large. It is difficult to predict how our efforts with respect to social and sustainability matters will be evaluated by current and prospective investors or by our customers or business partners. Our business, including the self-service moving offerings provided under our U-Pack brand, is increasingly dependent on the internet for attracting and securing customers, and the possibility that fraudulent behavior may confuse or deceive customers heightens the risk of damage to our reputation and increases the time and expense required to protect and maintain the integrity of our brands. 24Table of ContentsWith the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity, even when based upon incorrect information or false statements, can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and, thus, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands. ​Our corporate reputation and business depend on a variety of intellectual property rights, and if we face infringement claims, the costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our rights or to defend against infringement claims could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We have registered or are pursuing registration of various marks and designs as trademarks in the United States, including, but not limited to, “ArcBest,” “ABF Freight,” “FleetNet America,” “Panther Premium Logistics,” “MoLo,” “U-Pack,” “The Skill & The Will,” and “More Than Logistics.” For some marks, we also have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service or trade names or logos or designs similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. We have obtained or are pursuing patent protection on internally developed and certain purchased technology, including equipment and process patents in connection with the previously disclosed pilot test program at ABF Freight. Competitors or other third parties could attempt to reproduce or reverse-engineer our patented technologies, or we could be subject to third-party claims of infringement. Any of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property, whether owned or licensed, could be challenged or invalidated, or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our efforts to obtain, enforce, or protect our proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party infringement claims, may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. ​Risks Related to Our Industry​A nationwide or global disruption in the supply chain could increase volatility in freight volumes and materially impact our business.​Our business may be materially impacted by the cyclical nature of the supply chain industry which has been exacerbated due to material scarcity, port congestion, digital transformation, and changes in consumer spending, among other challenges following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which we are vulnerable to and may be negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions is uncertain and dependent upon the duration and severity of labor and supply shortages as well as other factors beyond our control, such as extreme weather events, natural disasters, cybersecurity breaches, government shutdowns, or other events. The global supply chain continues to be adversely affected by port congestion and an equipment shortage in numerous ports across the United States. Supply chain disruptions have and may continue to have a significant impact on consumer prices, demand, and bottlenecks in production, which may negatively impact our freight volume, operating costs, and ability to serve our customers.​We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address factors that could affect our profitability, growth prospects, and ability to compete in the transportation and logistics market.​We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. We compete with LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. We also compete with domestic and global logistics service providers, including asset-light logistics companies, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers that compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The competitive factors material to our business are the following:​●Our Asset-Based segment competes primarily with nonunion motor carriers who generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure than union carriers for freight-handling and driving personnel and have greater operating flexibility because they are subject to less-stringent labor work rules. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors have allowed for a lower cost structure than that of our Asset-Based segment. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution 25Table of Contentsrates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact the operating results of our Asset-Based segment relative to our competitors in the LTL industry.●Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels.●Enhanced visibility of capacity options in the marketplace is increasing and customers may seek bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may generally depress prices or result in the loss of some business to our competitors.●Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.●Certain of our competitors may more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete.●Customers are increasingly focused on concerns related to climate change and they may select transportation providers which are able to reduce emissions through efficiency improvements to existing and emerging technologies, adoption of alternative fuels or through carbon offsetting mechanisms.●Our FleetNet operations also face challenges, and could suffer loss of business, due to companies that choose to insource their fleet repair and maintenance services.​Additionally, as the retail industry continues its trend toward increases in e-commerce, the manner in which our customers source or utilize our services will continue to evolve. If we are unable to successfully adapt and implement appropriate measures in response to these changes, our operating results could be adversely affected.​Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.​In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to parts shortages and manufacturing disruptions, increased costs of materials and labor and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. GHG emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations as well as fuel costs. Additional state-mandated emission-control requirements could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner operators for portions of our ArcBest segment operations, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices, which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry, which could lead to or exacerbate a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  ​We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations, which may be difficult to procure in the event of decreased supply or other supply chain disruptions. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. Total capital expenditures for 2021 were reduced due to parts shortages and manufacturing disruptions. As a result, a portion of our previously planned capital expenditures for 2021 carried over into our 2022 investment plans. When market forces result in demand outstripping supply, we have and may continue to face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs for new tractors or trailers, as well as related parts and services, for our Asset-Based operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and growth initiatives, results of operations, and financial condition. ​26Table of ContentsFuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters; armed conflicts; terrorist attacks; actions by producers, including a decrease in drilling activity or the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production; legislation or regulations that require or result in new or alternate uses or other increases in the demand for fuel traditionally used by trucks; or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil and diesel, political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes that are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.​Our Asset-Based segment and certain operations of our ArcBest segment assess a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts the total billed revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment measure and, consequently, our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to the corresponding decline in our fuel costs. ​Risks Related to Employees and Benefits​If we have difficulty attracting and retaining employees, or if ABF Freight is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​With the exception of certain geographic markets, we have not historically experienced significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers, technicians and freight-handling personnel for our Asset-Based operations, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage or shipment levels. During 2021, we faced challenges with hiring an adequate number of personnel to meet increases in demand. The available pool of drivers and technicians has been declining, which has caused and may continue to cause us more difficulty in retaining and hiring qualified drivers and other personnel. Both our profitability and our ability to grow could be adversely affected if we encounter difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, technicians and freight-handling personnel or if we become subject to contractually required increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions that result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the Company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business. ​As of December 2021, approximately 82% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT that will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. If we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs. The terms of any future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may also result in higher labor costs, insufficient operational flexibility, which may increase our operating costs, a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages. ​27Table of ContentsWe could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.​ABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. These multiemployer plans, established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed and cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan in a relatively short period of time pursuant to an agreement. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan. ​The multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. Many of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded, as further discussed in Note J to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ​The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 was signed into law on March 11, 2021 and includes the Butch Lewis Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act of 2021 (the “Pension Relief Act”), which includes provisions to improve funding for multiemployer pension plans, including financial assistance provided to qualifying underfunded plans through the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (the “PBGC”) to secure pension benefits for plan participants. On July 9, 2021, the PBGC announced an interim final rule implementing a Special Financial Assistance Program to administer funds to severely underfunded eligible multiemployer pension plans under the Pension Relief Act. We are monitoring the impact these legislative actions may have on the funding status of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes; however, we cannot determine with any certainty the minimum contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements or the impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.  ​ABF Freight’s obligations to these plans are generally specified in the 2018 ABF NMFA and other related supplemental agreements. These pension plans provide the best retirement benefits in the industry. However, ABF Freight pays some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry and continues to address the effect of the Asset-Based segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results in discussions with the IBT. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. Future contribution rates will be determined through the negotiation process for contract periods following the term of the current collective bargaining agreement. ​Risks Related to Third Parties​We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships.​A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth or higher shipment levels, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations, revenues, profitability and customer relationships.​28Table of ContentsOur ability to secure the services of third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control, including unfavorable pricing conditions; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators and drivers of contracted carriers for our ArcBest segment; shortages in available cargo capacity of third parties; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in government regulations affecting the transportation industry and their related impact on operations, such as hours-of-service rules and the ELD mandate; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our ArcBest segment. ​In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with the operations of our ArcBest segment, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are owner operators, independent contractors, or employees working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents or incidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries including death. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in contracting with them initially or retaining them over time. We or our subsidiaries could be held directly responsible for these third-party claims and, regardless of ultimate liability, may incur significant costs and expenses in defending these claims. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all.​Our engagement of independent contractor drivers to provide a portion of the capacity for our ArcBest segment exposes us to different risks than we face with our employee drivers. If we have difficulty in securing independent owner operators, or if we incur increased costs to utilize independent owner operators, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​The driver fleet for portions of our ArcBest segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in owner operator compensation, our services may be less competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as these independent owner operators and individuals are third-party service providers, rather than our employees, they may decline loads of freight from time to time, which may impede our ability to deliver freight in a timely manner. If we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our ArcBest segment.​Additionally, we pay independent contractor drivers a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause the fuel surcharge we pay to independent contractors to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs, which could adversely impact the results of operations of our ArcBest segment.​If the independent contractors we contract with are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, or if we experience operational or regulatory issues related to our use of these contract drivers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​Class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in the transportation and logistics industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. Many states have enacted restrictive laws that make it difficult to successfully prove independent-contractor status, and all states have enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors. In the event of such reclassification of our owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest and under vicarious liability principles. Such liabilities and costs, to the extent they arise, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our ArcBest segment.29Table of Contents​Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters​We are subject to litigation risks, and at times may need to initiate litigation, which could result in significant costs and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including class-action litigation and other legal proceedings brought by customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties, related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities, including damages, fines, penalties, and substantial legal and related costs, that may result from these claims and litigation. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost of, and ability to obtain, insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort from our management team. Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings. ​We establish reserves based on our assessment of known legal matters and contingencies. New legal claims, or subsequent developments related to known legal claims, asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.​Our business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations in the transportation industry, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. ​Various international, federal, state and local agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, and the costs to comply with such regulations could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services. Failure to comply with laws and regulations can result in penalties, revocation of our permits or licenses, or both civil and criminal actions against us. In addition to the potential harm to our reputation and brands, the financial burdens resulting from such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Failures by us, or our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with the various applicable federal safety laws and regulations, or downgrades in our safety rating, could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, and could cause us to lose customers, as well as the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs, or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage.​Our ArcBest segment utilizes third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulatory requirements. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, or if we experience a shortage of quality third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations, there could be a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our ArcBest and FleetNet segments. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in governmental or third-party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to address or remedy, violations by them.​We are also subject to stringent and changing privacy laws, regulations and standards as well as policies, contracts and other obligations related to data privacy, including customer and employee data. As a provider of worldwide transportation and logistics services, we collect and process significant amounts of customer data on a daily basis. Recently, there have been global efforts by governments and consumer groups for increased transparency in how customer data is utilized and how customers and employees can control the use and storage of their data. Complying with new data protection laws and regulations may increase our compliance costs or require us to modify our data handling practices. Non-compliance could result in governmental or consumer actions against us and even perceived non-compliance may otherwise adversely impact 30Table of Contentsour reputation, operating results and financial condition. The uncertainty of the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, and their increasing scope and complexity, create regulatory risks that will likely increase over time. Additionally, if third parties or others violate obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security, such violations may also put our customers’ or employees’ information at risk and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business.​Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.​We routinely transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives, and, at certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel and oil in underground and aboveground tanks and other containers. In connection with these operations, we are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other areas: emission controls, transportation of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil. We may be subject to substantial fines, civil penalties, or third-party initiated lawsuits if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required inspections and testing provisions. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any clean-up costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles.​These operations also involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, a spill or accident involving hazardous substances, and hazardous waste disposal. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury.​Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to clean-up costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other GHG emissions, and some form of federal, state, and/or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. Emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions may require changes in our operating practices and impair equipment productivity. Compliance with laws and regulations related to climate risk may also increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. We may also incur significant costs to comply with increased regulation regarding environmental monitoring and reporting requirements. We are subject to increasing investor and customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to shareholder proposals, customer-led initiatives, or our customers’ efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure, business, or results of operations.​Risks Related to Financial Considerations​We are subject to interest rate risk and certain covenants under our financing arrangements. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds or our borrowing costs could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.​We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our borrowings on the accounts receivable securitization program (“A/R Securitization”) and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) under our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $115.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2022, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit 31Table of ContentsFacility, future borrowings against our A/R Securitization, new notes payable or finance lease arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including inflation, governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.​Our Credit Agreement and A/R Securitization contain customary financial covenants and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. Failing to achieve certain required financial ratios could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.​If we default under the terms of the Credit Agreement or our A/R Securitization and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. An event of a default under either of these facilities could constitute automatic default on the other of these facilities and could trigger cross-default provisions in our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or A/R Securitization, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which the facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or one or both of the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if one or both of the facilities is terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be favorable or acceptable. A default under the Credit Agreement or A/R Securitization, changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds or our borrowing costs, or our inability to renew our financing arrangements with terms that are acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.​Claims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance, including medical plans, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​Claims may be asserted against us for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation related to accidents or events occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize, for our actions in retaining their services, for loss or damage to our customers’ goods or other damages for which we are alleged or may be determined to be responsible. Such claims against us and associated costs and legal expenses may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or our established reserves, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. ​We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss and damage claims for the operations of our Asset-Based segment and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase, and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage. Our self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if we were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, our insurance costs or collateral requirements could materially increase, or we could experience difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. In recent years, several insurance companies have completely stopped offering coverage to trucking companies or have significantly reduced the amount of coverage they offer or have significantly raised premiums as a result of increases in the severity of automobile liability claims and sharply higher costs of settlements and verdicts. Our insurance premiums or deductibles could increase in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. The impact of climate change, including its effect on weather-related events which may disrupt our operations or damage our property and equipment, may increase our claims liabilities 32Table of Contentsand the cost to obtain adequate insurance coverage for our business. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty liability. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future, which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements. ​Future impairment, if any, of our goodwill and intangibles could adversely affect our earnings.​Our goodwill and intangible assets are primarily associated with acquisitions in the ArcBest segment. As of December 31, 2021, we had recorded goodwill of $300.3 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $126.6 million, which includes goodwill and intangibles acquired in the MoLo acquisition of $214.0 million and $76.9 million, respectively. Our annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021 and 2020 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances. Our annual impairment evaluations for 2019 indicated an impairment of certain of these balances and, as a result, we recorded a noncash impairment related to goodwill and finite-lived customer relationship intangible assets of $20.0 million (pre-tax) and $6.0 million (pre-tax), respectively. (See Note D to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impairment charge.) ​We also evaluated our goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment as of December 31, 2021 and, based on our analysis, we believe the balances reported in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate as of that date. Given the uncertainties regarding the economic environment and the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of impairment evaluations and accounting estimates will prove to be accurate. Significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related regulations, insufficient cash flows from acquired operations, or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of our reporting units could result in impairment and noncash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Risks Related to Other External Conditions ​We are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions, which can be impacted by government actions, including suspension of government operations and imposition of trade tariffs. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, inflation, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case primarily in the North American economy, and capacity in the trucking industry as well as our customers’ inventory levels and freight profile characteristics. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight and related pricing in the markets we serve. Further changes to U.S. or international trade policy or other global trade impacts could result in increased cost for goods transported globally, which may lead to reduced consumer demand, or trading partners could limit trades with countries that impose anti-trade measures, which may lead to a lower volume of global economic trading activity. International security concerns, such as the rising geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine, and potential actions or retaliatory measures taken in respect thereof, could have a material adverse effect on global trade and economic activity.​Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. Our operations and the rates we obtain for 33Table of Contentsour services may also be negatively impacted when economic conditions lead to a decrease in shipping demand, which in turn results in excess tractor and trailer capacity in the industry. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Conversely, during times of higher shipping demand, tight equipment capacity in the industry may negatively impact the service levels we are able to provide to our customers. Demand for our roadside assistance and fleet maintenance management services may also decline in a weaker economic environment when customers of our FleetNet segment experience declines in their equipment utilization.  ​Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, which could negatively impact our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend unsecured credit to these customers, which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables. ​Inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.​Inflation in the United States climbed to its highest level in 40 years at the end of 2021. Significant inflation can adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition by increasing interest rates and the cost of equipment, labor, purchased transportation, fuel, and other expenses. In a highly inflationary environment, we may be unable to secure adequate price increases for our services to offset the increases in our operating costs, which could reduce our operating margins.​Our business and results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and climate change.​Our operations are, and may in the future be, impacted by seasonal fluctuations and, at times, inclement weather conditions that affect tonnage and shipment levels, service events, demand for our services, and operating costs, which in turn may impact our revenues and operating results, as further described in “Seasonality” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions. Severe weather events and natural disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or third-party service providers, damage existing infrastructure, destroy our assets, affect regional economies, or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, each of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results.​​"
15,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2021-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS​Our business is subject to a variety of material risks about which we are aware. We could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. This Risk Factors
 section discusses the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry and our Company that are largely out of our control. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occur, it could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows; impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled; and/or result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.​Risks Related to Significant Unusual Events​The widespread outbreak of an illness or disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, or any other public health crisis, as well as regulatory measures implemented in response to such events, could negatively impact the health and safety of our employees and/or adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Our business has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and could be negatively impacted by the widespread outbreak of another illness, disease, or public health crisis in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide and created significant volatility and disruption to financial markets. Measures intended to prevent the spread of a health epidemic could also have an adverse effect on our business. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 led governments and other authorities to impose restrictions that have resulted in business closures and disrupted supply chains worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to prevent its spread negatively impacted demand for our services, and thus our shipment and tonnage levels, primarily in the second quarter of 2020, and could negatively impact our business in the future. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business during 2020 is further discussed in “COVID-19” within Part II, Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.​Through the date of this filing, we have not experienced significant disruptions in our operations due to quarantines or positive COVID-19 cases among our employees. However, we have closed certain of our service center facilities for short periods of time as a result of positive COVID-19 cases and performed deep cleaning procedures at these locations. We cannot be certain that we will not experience disruptions to our operations in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. If a high number of our employees were to contract COVID-19, our operations and customer service levels, and, consequently, our results of operations, could be adversely impacted.​The extent of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our employees is uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and government restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. Extended periods of economic disruption and resulting declines in industrial production and manufacturing, consumer spending, and demand for our services, as well as the ability of our customers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​We, or the third parties who provide services for us, may be adversely affected by external events for which our business continuity plans may not adequately prepare us.​The occurrence of severe weather, natural disasters, health epidemics, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events or conditions that impact us or the operations of third parties who provide services for us have the potential to significantly impact our ability to conduct business. Although we have business continuity plans in place, including an emergency succession plan, there is no guarantee that our plans can be successfully implemented. Even if we were to successfully implement our continuity plans, we may incur substantial expenses and there is no guarantee that our business, financial condition, and results of operations will not be materially impacted.17Table of Contents​Risks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity ​We are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure or cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We depend on the proper functioning, availability and security of our information systems, including communications, data processing, financial, and operating systems, as well as proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Any significant failure or other disruption in our critical information systems, including cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents, that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that result in proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others, being compromised could have a significant impact on our operations. Any new or enhanced technology that we may develop and implement may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and may be more prone to related incidents. We also utilize certain software applications provided by third parties; provide underlying data to third parties; grant access to certain of our systems to third parties who provide certain outsourced administrative functions or other services; and increasingly store and transmit data with our customers and third parties by means of connected information technology systems, any of which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Any problems caused by or impacting these third parties, including cyber attacks and security breaches at a vendor, could result in claims, litigation, losses and/or liabilities and materially adversely affect our ability to provide service to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. ​In response to the health and safety risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, we have transitioned a significant portion of our employee population to remote work arrangements, which may increase our exposure to cybersecurity risks, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing, and other cybersecurity attacks. Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the heightened risk, we cannot be certain that such measures will be effective to prevent a cybersecurity incident from materializing.​A significant disruption in our information technology systems or a significant cybersecurity incident, including denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees or vendors with access to our systems or data, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks through our technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent such risks. While we maintain property and cyber insurance, losses arising from a significant disaster or cyber incident would likely exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We do not have insurance coverage specific to losses resulting from a pandemic.​We have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service attacks, malware attacks, and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. To our knowledge, the various protections we have employed have been effective to date in identifying these types of events at a point when the impact on our business could be minimized. We must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that could have a security impact. Despite our efforts, due to the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and the development of new techniques for attack, we may be unable to anticipate or promptly detect, or implement adequate protective or remedial measures against, the activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks.​We engage third parties to provide certain information technology needs, including licensed software, and the inability to maintain these third-party systems or licenses, or any interruptions or failures thereof, could adversely affect our business. ​Certain of our information technology needs are provided by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are 18Table of Contentsessential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems depends upon the internet, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers (terrestrial, cellular and satellite). The information technology systems of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, or in other services provided to us by outside service providers upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide. Such disruptions or failures could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that supports our operations, and these operations depend on our ability to maintain these licenses. We have no guarantees that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. ​If we are unable to timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology or processes, or if we fail to realize potential benefits associated with new or enhanced technology or processes, including the pilot test program at ABF Freight, we may suffer competitive disadvantage, loss of customers, or other consequences, including any write-offs associated therewith, that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.​The industry has experienced rapid changes in technology, including the development of new technology and enhancements in existing technology. As technology improves, our customers may be able to find alternatives to our services to meet their freight transportation and logistics needs. New entrants to the market, including start-ups and emerging business models such as digital freight brokerage platforms, have also expanded the field of competition and driven an increased pressure for innovation in the industry.  ​Technology and new market entrants may also disrupt the way we, and our competitors, operate to provide freight logistics services. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions from their suppliers, and we believe that we must respond by investing in the enhancement of existing technology and in the development of new and innovative solutions to improve efficiencies and meet our customers’ needs. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments in software and physical assets that are in various stages of development and implementation. These investments include a pilot test program we began in early 2019 to improve freight handling at ABF Freight as further described in “Asset-Based Segment” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A number of factors will be involved in determining proof of concept and there can be no assurances that pilot testing will be successful or expand beyond current testing locations.​Our efforts and investments in technology innovation may continue to require significant ongoing research and development costs and implementation costs, and may involve potential unforeseen challenges and new or unforeseen risks associated with the technology. The success of our approach to technology innovation is dependent upon market acceptance of our solutions and a number of other factors, including our ability to:​●deploy funds and resources for investment in technology and innovation; ●achieve the right balance of strategic investments in existing or developing technology and innovation;●timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology, including integration into current operations and interaction with existing systems; ●train our employees to operate the technology and/or achieve appropriate customer, carrier or other desired user adoption of the technology; ●adequately anticipate challenges and respond to unforeseen challenges; ●detect and remedy defects in enhanced or new technology; and●recover costs of investment through increased business levels, higher prices, improved efficiencies or other means.​If we do not pursue technological advances or engage in innovation, if we fail to successfully or timely develop and deploy enhanced or new technology, or if any enhanced or new technology does not yield the results we expect, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage; lose customers; incur higher than anticipated costs, including the possible impact of asset impairment or the write-off of software development costs; or fail to meet the goals of our internal growth strategy, any one of which could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.​19Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Business​The loss of or reduction in business from one or more large customers, or an overall reduction in our customer base, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Although we do not have a significant customer concentration, the growth of our business could be materially impacted and our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if we were to lose all or a portion of the business of some of our large customers. Such loss may occur if our customers choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors; demand pricing concessions for our services; require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs; or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities. Our customer relationships are generally not subject to long-term contractual obligations or minimum volume commitments, and we cannot ensure that our current customer relationships will continue at the same business levels or at all. A reduction in our customer base or difficulty in collecting, or the inability to collect, payments from our customers due to changes in pricing, economic hardship or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Our initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful.​Developing service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.​Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel, and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. Hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary labor inefficiencies. We have also incurred increased costs associated with long-term investment in the development of our owner operator fleet and contract carrier capacity for our ArcBest segment. As we focus on growing the business in our ArcBest segment, we may also encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments, which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors and in which we will encounter new competitive challenges, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.​We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels or changing market demands, as portions of salaries, wages, and benefits are fixed in nature and the adjustments that would otherwise be necessary to align the labor cost structure to corresponding business levels are limited as we strive to maintain customer service. It is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in periods of rapid or unexpected change. Due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand for our services, we made operational changes in our Asset-Based network beginning in second quarter 2020, including workforce reductions to better align resources with business levels. As tonnage levels increased in the second half of 2020, certain operational resources were added back and they will continue to be carefully managed to available business. We may incur additional costs related to purchased transportation and/or experience labor inefficiencies while, and for a time following, training employees who are hired in response to growth. Incurring additional labor and/or purchased transportation costs which are disproportionate to our business levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We periodically evaluate and modify the network of our Asset-Based operations to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile the segment’s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that these network changes, to the extent such network changes are made, will result in a material improvement in our Asset-Based segment’s results of operations.​Damage to our corporate reputation may cause our business to suffer.​ArcBest is recognized as a leading logistics provider with creative problem solvers who deliver innovative logistics solutions. Beyond this fundamental marketplace recognition of our collective brand identity, our other key brands represent additional unique value in their target markets. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of our brands. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those 20Table of Contentsof our third-party contract carriers and their drivers and owner operators or other third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers’ image of our brands, including ArcBest, ABF Freight, Panther Premium Logistics, and U-Pack, and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues, and similar matters, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Our business and our image could also be negatively impacted by a breach of our corporate policies by employees or vendors. Our business, including the self-service moving services provided under our U-Pack brand, is increasingly dependent on the internet for attracting and securing customers, and the possibility that fraudulent behavior may confuse or deceive customers heightens the risk of damage to our reputation and increases the time and expense required to protect and maintain the integrity of our brands. With the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity, especially when based upon incorrect information or false statements, can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and, thus, have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands. ​Our corporate reputation and business depend on a variety of intellectual property rights, and if we face infringement claims, the costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our rights or to defend against infringement claims could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We have registered or are pursuing registration of various marks and designs as trademarks in the United States, including, but not limited to, “ArcBest”, “ABF Freight”, “FleetNet America”, “Panther Premium Logistics”, “U-Pack”, “The Skill & The Will”, and “More Than Logistics.” For some marks, we also have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service or trade names or logos or designs similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered trademarks. From time to time, we have acquired or attempted to acquire internet domain names held by others when such names have caused, or had the potential to cause, consumer confusion. Additionally, our business and operations utilize and depend upon both internally developed and purchased technology. We have obtained or are pursuing patent protection on internally developed and certain purchased technology, including equipment and process patents in connection with the previously disclosed pilot test program at ABF Freight. Competitors or other third parties could attempt to reproduce or reverse-engineer our patented technologies, or we could be subject to third-party claims of infringement. Any of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property, whether owned or licensed, could be challenged or invalidated, or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our efforts to obtain, enforce, or protect our proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party infringement claims, may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. ​Risks Related to Our Industry​We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address factors that could affect our profitability, growth prospects, and ability to compete in the transportation and logistics market.​We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. We compete with LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. We also compete with domestic and global logistics service providers, including asset-light logistics companies, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers that compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The competitive factors material to our business are the following:​●Our Asset-Based segment competes primarily with nonunion motor carriers who generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure than union carriers for freight-handling and driving personnel, and have greater operating flexibility because they are subject to less-stringent labor work rules. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors have allowed for a lower cost structure than that of our Asset-Based segment. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution 21Table of Contentsrates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact the operating results of our Asset-Based segment relative to our competitors in the LTL industry.●Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels.●Enhanced visibility of capacity options in the marketplace is increasing and customers may accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may generally depress prices or result in the loss of some business to our competitors.●Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.●Certain of our competitors may more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete.●Our FleetNet operations also face challenges, and could suffer loss of business, due to companies that choose to insource their fleet repair and maintenance services.​Additionally, we have implemented measures, such as cubic minimum charges, in response to the evolving freight shipping trends over the last several years, including changes in shipment profiles and the acceleration in e-commerce. As the retail industry continues its trend toward increases in e-commerce, particularly in light of the impacts of COVID-19 on brick-and-mortar stores, the manner in which our customers source or utilize our services will continue to be impacted. If we are unable to successfully adapt and implement appropriate measures in response to these changes, our operating results could be adversely affected.​Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.​In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations as well as fuel costs. A number of states have mandated, and California and certain other states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment, which could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner operators for portions of our ArcBest segment operations, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices, which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry, which could lead to a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  ​We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations, which may be difficult to procure in the event of decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. At times, market forces may create market situations in which demand outstrips supply. In those situations, we may face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers, as well as related parts and services, for our Asset-Based operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. ​22Table of ContentsWe depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters; armed conflicts; terrorist attacks; actions by producers, including a decrease in drilling activity or the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production; legislation or regulations that require or result in new or alternate uses or other increase in the demand for fuel traditionally used by trucks; or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil and diesel, political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes that are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.​Our Asset-Based segment and certain operations of our ArcBest segment assess a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts the total billed revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment measure and, consequently, our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to the corresponding decline in our fuel costs. ​Risks Related to Employees and Benefits​We depend on our employees to support our business operations and future growth opportunities. If we have difficulty attracting and retaining employees, or if ABF Freight is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​With the exception of certain geographic markets, we have not historically experienced significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers, technicians and freight-handling personnel for our Asset-Based operations, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage or shipment levels. However, the available pool of drivers and technicians has been declining, which may cause us more difficulty in retaining and hiring qualified drivers and other personnel. Both our profitability and our ability to grow could be adversely affected if we encounter difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, technicians and freight-handling personnel or if we become subject to contractually required increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions that result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the Company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business. ​As of December 2020, approximately 82% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT that will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. If we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs. The terms of any future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may also result in higher labor costs, insufficient operational flexibility, which may increase our operating costs, a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages. ​23Table of ContentsWe could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.​ABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. These multiemployer plans, established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT) and cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan in a relatively short period of time pursuant to an agreement. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan. ​The multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight’s obligations to these plans are generally specified in the 2018 ABF NMFA and other related supplemental agreements, which will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. ABF Freight pays some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry and continues to address the effect of the Asset-Based segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results in discussions with the IBT. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. Future contribution rates will be determined through the negotiation process for contract periods following the term of the current collective bargaining agreement. We cannot determine with any certainty the minimum contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements or the impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition. ​Many of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded, as further discussed in Note I to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The underfunded status of these plans developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to achieve, if it can be achieved at all. In addition, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The reduction or loss of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk or instability in the financial markets on plan assets and liabilities, and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, all of which are beyond our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities, and our future contribution requirements. Many of the multiemployer pension funds to which we contribute could become insolvent in the near future; however, we would continue to be obligated to make contributions to those funds under the terms of the 2018 ABF NMFA.​Risks Related to Third Parties​We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships.​A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth or higher shipment levels, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, including the effect of third-party carrier rate increases outpacing customer pricing, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations, revenues, profitability and customer relationships.24Table of Contents​Our ability to secure the services of third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control, including the inability to obtain the services of reliable third parties at competitive prices; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators and drivers of contracted carriers for our ArcBest segment; shortages in available cargo capacity of third parties; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in government regulations affecting the transportation industry and their related impact on operations, such as hours-of-service rules and the ELD mandate; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our ArcBest segment. ​In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with the operations of our ArcBest segment, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are owner operators, independent contractors, or employees working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents or incidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries including death. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in contracting with them initially or retaining them over time. We or our subsidiaries could be held directly responsible for these third-party claims and, regardless of ultimate liability, may incur significant costs and expenses in defending these claims. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all.​Our engagement of independent contractor drivers to provide a portion of the capacity for our ArcBest segment exposes us to different risks than we face with our employee drivers. If we have difficulty in securing independent owner operators, or if we incur increased costs to utilize independent owner operators, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​The driver fleet for portions of our ArcBest segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in owner operator compensation, our services may be less competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as these independent owner operators and individuals are third-party service providers, rather than our employees, they may decline loads of freight from time to time, which may impede our ability to deliver freight in a timely manner. If we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our ArcBest segment.​Additionally, we pay independent contractor drivers a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause the fuel surcharge we pay to independent contractors to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs, which could adversely impact the results of operations of our ArcBest segment.​If the independent contractors we contract with are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, or if we experience operational or regulatory issues related to our use of these contract drivers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​The transportation and logistics industry’s heavy dependence on independent contractors for providing services has made it a target of litigation. Class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in the industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. Many states have enacted restrictive laws that make it difficult to successfully prove independent-contractor status, and all states have enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations resulting in the reclassification of the owner operators of the operations within our ArcBest segment as employees. In the event of such reclassification of these owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. These liabilities and additional costs could include exposure, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ 25Table of Contentscompensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest and under vicarious liability principles, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our ArcBest segment.​Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters​We are subject to litigation risks, and at times may need to initiate litigation, which could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including class-action litigation and other legal proceedings brought by customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties, related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities, including damages, fines, penalties, and substantial legal and related costs, that may result from these claims and litigation. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost of, and ability to obtain, insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort from our management team. Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings. ​We establish reserves based on our assessment of known legal matters and contingencies. New legal claims, or subsequent developments related to known legal claims, asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.​Our business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations in the transportation industry, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. ​Various international, federal, state and local agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions, drivers’ hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics, or cargo security. Increases in costs to comply with such regulations or the failure to comply, which could subject us to penalties or revocation of our permits or licenses, could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services. Failure to comply with safety and security laws and regulations can result in both civil and criminal actions against the Company. In addition to the potential harm to our reputation and brands, the financial burdens resulting from such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Failures by us, or our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with the various applicable federal safety laws and regulations, or downgrades in our safety rating, could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose customers, as well as the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs, or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage.​Our ArcBest segment utilizes third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements, as previously mentioned. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, or if we experience a shortage of quality third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations, there could be a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our ArcBest and FleetNet segments. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in governmental or third-party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to address or remedy, violations by them.​As a provider of worldwide transportation and logistics services, the Company collects and processes significant amounts of customer data on a daily basis. Recently, there have been global efforts by governments and consumer groups for 26Table of Contentsincreased transparency in how customer data is utilized and how customers can control the use and storage of their data. Complying with new data protection laws and regulations may increase the Company’s compliance costs or require us to modify our data handling practices. Non-compliance could result in governmental or consumer actions against us and may otherwise adversely impact our reputation, operating results and financial condition. The uncertainty of the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, and their increasing scope and complexity, create regulatory risks that will likely increase over time.​Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.​We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other areas: emission controls, transportation of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil. We may be subject to substantial fines or civil penalties if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required inspections and testing provisions. ​We routinely transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives. These operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, a spill or accident involving hazardous substances, and hazardous waste disposal. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury.​At certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel and oil in underground and aboveground tanks. Our material handling and storage, fueling, equipment maintenance and cleaning subject us to the EPA underground storage tank regulations, the Clean Water Act oil pollution prevention and stormwater regulations, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration hazardous materials regulations. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any clean-up costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles. ​Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal, state, and/or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation. However, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions may also require changes in our operating practices and impair equipment productivity. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure, business, or results of operations.​Risks Related to Financial Considerations​We are subject to interest rate risk and certain  covenants under our financing arrangements. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.​We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our borrowings on the accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”). 27Table of ContentsAlthough we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $70.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2021, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization program, new notes payable or finance lease arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.​Our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program contain customary financial covenants and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. Failing to achieve certain financial ratios as required by our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.​If we default under the terms of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) or our accounts receivable securitization program and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. An event of a default under either of these facilities could constitute automatic default on the other of these facilities and could trigger cross-default provisions in our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or accounts receivable securitization program, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which the facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or one or both of the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if one or both of the facilities is terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be favorable or acceptable. A default under the Credit Agreement or accounts receivable securitization program, changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements, or our inability to renew our financing arrangements with terms that are acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.​Claims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance, including medical plans, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​Claims may be asserted against us for accidents or for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation related to events occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize, for our actions in retaining their services, for loss or damage to our customers’ goods or other damages for which we are alleged or may be determined to be responsible. Such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we have established reserves that are adjusted to reflect our claims experience, actual claims costs and legal expenses may exceed our estimates. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. ​We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss and damage claims for the operations of our Asset-Based segment and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase, and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event. Our self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if we were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or 28Table of Contentsunderwriters leave the trucking sector, our insurance costs or collateral requirements could materially increase, or we could experience difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums or deductibles in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty liability. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future, which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements. ​Our total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected.​As of December 31, 2020, we had recorded goodwill of $88.3 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $55.0 million. Our annual impairment evaluations for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2020 and 2018 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances. Our goodwill and intangible assets are primarily associated with acquisitions in the ArcBest segment. Our annual impairment evaluations for 2019 indicated an impairment of certain of these balances and, as a result, we recorded a noncash impairment related to goodwill and finite-lived customer relationship intangible assets of $20.0 million (pre-tax) and $6.0 million (pre-tax), respectively. (See Note D to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impairment charge.) ​Considering the current environment, we also evaluated our goodwill and intangible assets for indicators of impairment as of December 31, 2020 and, based on our analysis, we believe the balances reported in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate as of December 31, 2020. Given the uncertainties regarding the economic environment and the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for purposes of impairment evaluations and accounting estimates will prove to be accurate. Significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of our reporting units could result in impairment and noncash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Risks Related to Other External Conditions ​Our business is cyclical in nature, and we are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions, which can be impacted by government actions, including suspension of government operations and imposition of trade tariffs. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case primarily in the North American economy, and capacity in the trucking industry as well as our customers’ inventory levels and freight profile characteristics. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight and related pricing in the markets we serve. In connection with further changes to U.S. or international trade policy or other global trade impacts, the cost for goods transported globally could increase, which may lead to reduced consumer demands for such goods, or trading partners could limit trades with countries that impose anti-trade measures, which may lead to a lower volume of global economic trading activity. ​29Table of ContentsRecessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. Our operations and the rates we obtain for our services may also be negatively impacted when economic conditions lead to a decrease in shipping demand, which in turn results in excess tractor and trailer capacity in the industry. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Conversely, during times of higher shipping demand, tight equipment capacity in the industry may negatively impact the service levels we are able to provide to our customers. Demand for our roadside assistance and fleet maintenance management services may also decline in a weaker economic environment when customers of our FleetNet segment experience declines in their equipment utilization.  ​Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, which could negatively impact our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our cost structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend credit to certain of these customers, which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables. ​Our business and results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions, and natural disasters.​Our operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations that affect tonnage, shipment or service event levels, and demand for our services, which in turn may impact our revenues and operating results. Tonnage and shipment levels, service events, and operating costs of our segments have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by inclement weather conditions, as further described in “Seasonality” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Severe weather events and natural disasters, such as harsh winter weather, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or third-party service providers, damage existing infrastructure, destroy our assets, affect regional economies, or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, each of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and business levels and, consequently, our operating results.​​"
16,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2020-02-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS​Our business is subject to a variety of material risks about which we are aware. We could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial.  This Risk Factors
 section discusses some of the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry in general, as well as risks specific to our Company that are largely out of our control.  If any of these risks or circumstances actually occur, it could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows; impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled; and/or result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.​We are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure or cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We depend on the proper functioning, availability and security of our information systems, including communications, data processing, financial, and operating systems, as well as proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Any significant failure or other disruption in our critical information systems, including cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents, that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that result in proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others, being compromised could have a significant impact on our operations. Any new or enhanced technology that we may develop and implement may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and may be more prone to related incidents. We also utilize certain software applications provided by third parties; provide underlying data to third parties; grant access to certain of our systems to third parties who provide certain outsourced administrative functions or other services; and increasingly store and transmit data with our customers and third parties by means of connected information technology systems, any of which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Any problems caused by or impacting these third parties, including cyber attacks and security breaches at a vendor, could result in claims, litigation, losses and/or liabilities and adversely affect our ability to provide service to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. ​A significant disruption in our information technology systems or a significant cybersecurity incident, including denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees or vendors with access to our systems or data, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks through our technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. Our business interruption and cyber insurance would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe or certain cyber incidents; however, losses arising from a catastrophe or significant cyber incident would likely exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. ​We have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service attacks, malware attacks, and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. To our knowledge, the various protections we have employed have been effective to date in identifying these types of events at a point when the impact on our business could be minimized. We must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that could have a security impact.  Despite our efforts, due to the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and the development of new techniques for attack, we may be unable to anticipate or promptly detect, or implement adequate protective or remedial measures against, the activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. ​16Table of ContentsWe engage third parties to provide certain information technology needs, including licensed software, and the inability to maintain these third-party systems or licenses, or any interruptions or failures thereof, could adversely affect our business. ​Certain information technology needs are provided by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems depends upon the internet, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers (terrestrial, cellular and satellite).  The information technology systems of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, or in other services provided to us by outside service providers upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that supports our operations, and these operations depend on our ability to maintain these licenses. We have no guarantees that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.​If we are unable to timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology or processes, or if we fail to realize potential benefits associated with new or enhanced technology or processes, including the pilot test program at ABF Freight, we may suffer competitive disadvantage, loss of customers, or other consequences, including any write-offs associated therewith, that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.​The industry has experienced rapid changes in technology, including the development of new technology and enhancements in existing technology. As technology improves, our customers may be able to find alternatives to our services to meet their freight transportation and logistics needs. New entrants to the market, including start-ups and emerging business models such as digital freight brokerage platforms, have also expanded the field of competition and driven an increased pressure for innovation in the industry.  ​Technology and new market entrants may also disrupt the way we, and our competitors, operate to provide freight logistics services. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions from their suppliers, and we believe that we must respond by investing in the enhancement of existing technology and in the development of new and innovative solutions to improve efficiencies and meet our customers’ needs. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments in software and physical assets that are in various stages of development and implementation. In early 2019, we began a pilot test program to improve freight handling at ABF Freight. The pilot utilizes patented handling equipment, software, and a patented process to load and unload trailers more rapidly and safely, with full freight loads pulled out of the trailer onto the facility floor and accessible from multiple points. The pilot is in the early stages in a limited number of locations. ABF Freight has leased new facilities in the test pilot regions in Indiana and also at a new Kansas City distribution center location expected to open in late-summer 2020. A number of factors will be involved in determining proof of concept and there can be no assurances that pilot testing will be successful or expand beyond current testing locations.​17Table of ContentsOur efforts and investments in technology innovation may continue to require significant ongoing research and development costs and implementation costs, and may involve potential unforeseen challenges and new or unforeseen risks associated with the technology. The success of our approach to technology innovation is dependent upon market acceptance of our solutions and a number of other factors, including our ability to:​●deploy funds and resources for investment in technology and innovation; ●achieve the right balance of strategic investments in existing or developing technology and innovation;●timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology, including integration into current operations and interaction with existing systems; ●train our employees to operate the technology and/or achieve appropriate customer, carrier or other desired user adoption of the technology; ●adequately anticipate challenges and respond to unforeseen challenges; ●detect and remedy defects in enhanced or new technology; and●recover costs of investment through increased business levels, higher prices, improved efficiencies or other means.​If we do not pursue technological advances or engage in innovation, if we fail to successfully develop and deploy enhanced or new technology, or if the enhanced or new technology does not yield the results we expect, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage; lose customers; incur higher than anticipated costs, including the possible impact of asset impairment or the write-off of software development costs; or fail to meet the goals of our internal growth strategy, any one of which could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of or reduction in business from one or more large customers, or an overall reduction in our customer base, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Although we do not have a significant customer concentration, the growth of our business could be materially impacted and our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if we were to lose all or a portion of the business of some of our large customers.  Such loss may occur if our customers choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors; demand pricing concessions for our services; require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs; or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities.  Our customer relationships are generally not subject to long-term contractual obligations or minimum volume commitments, and we cannot ensure that our current customer relationships will continue at the same business levels or at all.  ​A reduction in our customer base or difficulty in collecting, or the inability to collect, payments from our customers due to changes in pricing, economic hardship or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability, growth prospects, and ability to compete in the transportation and logistics market.​We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. We compete with LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. We also compete with domestic and global logistics service providers, including asset-light logistics companies, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers that compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. These competitive factors include, but are not limited to, the following:​●Our Asset-Based segment competes primarily with nonunion motor carriers who generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure than union carriers for freight-handling and driving personnel, and have greater operating flexibility because they are subject to less stringent labor work rules. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors have allowed for a lower cost structure than that of our Asset-Based segment. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact the operating results of our Asset-Based segment relative to our competitors in the LTL industry.18Table of Contents●Some of our competitors have greater capital resources, a lower cost structure, or greater market share than we do or have other competitive advantages. The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger carriers and logistics service providers with these and other competitive advantages relating to their size and resources. Consolidations within the industry could also result in our competitors providing a more comprehensive set of services at competitive prices. These competitive pressures may cause a decrease in our freight volume or shipment levels or require us to lower the prices we charge for our services, which could adversely affect our results of operations, growth prospects and profitability.●Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels.●Enhanced visibility of capacity options in the marketplace is increasing and customers may accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, which may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors.●Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.●Certain of our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete.●Competition in the LTL industry from asset-light logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect customer relationships and prices in our Asset-Based operations. Conversely, the operations of our ArcBest segment may be adversely impacted if customers develop their own logistics operations, thus reducing demand for our services, or if shippers shift business to truckload brokerage companies or asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies’ trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight capacity industry-wide. ●Some of our competitors, such as railroads, are outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry and our service offerings may be less competitive in comparison as a result of certain challenges  within the motor carrier freight transportation industry, including the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; changes to driver hours-of-service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations.●Our FleetNet operations also face challenges, and could suffer loss of business, due to companies that choose to insource their fleet repair and maintenance services.​Additionally, the industry has experienced evolving freight shipping trends over the last several years, including overall growth and ongoing profile shift of bulkier shipments across the entire supply chain, the acceleration in e-commerce, and more unique requirements of many shipping and logistics solutions. An increasing percentage of freight is taking up more space in trailers without a corresponding increase in weight, which contributes to lower average weight per shipment. As the retail industry continues to undergo a shift away from the traditional brick-and-mortar model towards e-commerce, the manner in which our customers source or utilize our services will be impacted and our operating results could be adversely affected.​Our business is cyclical in nature, and we are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.​Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions, which can be impacted by government actions, including suspension of government operations and imposition of trade tariffs. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case primarily in the North American economy, and capacity in the trucking industry as well as our customers’ inventory levels and freight profile characteristics. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight and related pricing in the markets we serve. The U.S. government has taken certain actions with respect to its trade policies, including imposed tariffs affecting certain goods imported into the United States, and may take further actions in the future. Several governments have also imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the United States. In connection with further changes to U.S. or international trade policy, the cost for goods transported globally could increase, 19Table of Contentswhich may lead to reduced consumer demands for such goods, or trading partners could limit trades with countries that impose anti-trade measures, which may lead to a lower volume of global economic trading activity. ​Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. Our operations and the rates we obtain for our services may also be negatively impacted when economic conditions lead to a decrease in shipping demand, which in turn results in excess tractor and trailer capacity in the industry. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Conversely, during times of higher shipping demand, tight equipment capacity in the industry may negatively impact the service levels we are able to provide to our customers. Demand for our roadside assistance and fleet maintenance management services may also decline in a weaker economic environment when customers of our FleetNet segment experience declines in their equipment utilization.  ​Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, which could negatively impact our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our cost structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend credit to certain of these customers, which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables. ​Given the economic conditions of recent years, current economic uncertainties, and the potential impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the pricing environment and economic conditions, which are made for purposes of impairment tests related to operating assets and deferred tax assets, will prove to be accurate. ​Our business may also be negatively affected by uncertainty or changes in U.S. or global social, political or regulatory conditions. It is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or political and/or civil unrest on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition. ​We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our borrowings on the accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”). Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $70.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2020, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization program, new notes payable or finance lease arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. (See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.)​We could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may negatively impact our results of operations.​20Table of ContentsOur initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful.​Developing service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.​Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. Hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary labor inefficiencies. We have also incurred higher costs associated with long-term investment in the development of our owner operator fleet and contract carrier capacity for our ArcBest segment. As we focus on growing the business in our ArcBest segment, we may also encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments, which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors and in which we will encounter new competitive challenges, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.​We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels, as portions of salaries, wages, and benefits are fixed in nature and the adjustments that would otherwise be necessary to align the labor cost structure to corresponding business levels are limited as we strive to maintain customer service. We may not be able to appropriately adjust our cost structure to changing market demands. It is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in periods of rapid or unexpected change. We may incur additional costs related to purchased transportation and/or experience labor inefficiencies while, and for a time following, training employees who are hired in response to growth. Incurring additional labor and/or purchased transportation costs which are disproportionate to our business levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We periodically evaluate and modify the network of our Asset-Based operations to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile the segment’s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that these network changes, to the extent such network changes are made, will result in a material improvement in our Asset-Based segment’s results of operations.​We depend on our employees to support our business operations and future growth opportunities. If our relationship with our employees deteriorates, if we have difficulty attracting, retaining, and/or properly developing employees, or if ABF Freight is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​Our ability to maintain and grow our business depends, in part, on our ability to retain and attract additional sales representatives and other key operational personnel and to properly incentivize them to obtain new customers, maintain existing customer relationships, and efficiently manage our business. We are highly focused on the engagement of our workforce, including maintaining a culture of continuous growth and development for all employees and providing training and upskilling opportunities, especially as automation and artificial intelligence continues to evolve. We also work to ensure our compensation and benefits package remains competitive. If we are unable to properly develop and compensate our employees, our business growth and results of operations could be negatively impacted. We also face intense competition from competitors that are also vying for qualified and successful personnel. If we are unable to maintain or expand our workforce, our ability to increase our revenues and operate our business could be negatively impacted.  Sales representatives and certain other personnel who leave our organization may attempt to solicit our customers or employees, which could result in lost revenue and business disruption. We have attempted to mitigate this risk through the use of non-solicitation contractual provisions, but there is no guarantee that such efforts will be effective. Additionally, we may have to enforce our rights under such provisions through litigation, which may be costly, time consuming, and distracting for management, and we may not be successful.  ​21Table of ContentsWith the exception of certain geographic markets, we have not historically experienced significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers, technicians and freight-handling personnel for our Asset-Based operations, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage or shipment levels. However, the available pool of drivers and technicians has been declining, which may cause us more difficulty in retaining and hiring qualified drivers and other personnel. Both our profitability and our ability to grow could be adversely affected if we encounter difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, technicians and freight-handling personnel or if we become subject to contractually required increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions that result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the Company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business. ​As of December 2019, approximately 82% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT that will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. If we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs. The terms of any future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may also result in higher labor costs, insufficient operational flexibility which may increase our operating costs, a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages. ​If the independent contractors we contract with are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, or if we experience operational or regulatory issues related to our use of these contract drivers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​The transportation and logistics industry’s heavy dependence on independent contractors for providing services has made it a target of litigation. Class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in the industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. Many states have enacted restrictive laws that make it difficult to successfully prove independent-contractor status, and all states have enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors. For example, California Assembly Bill 5 (“AB 5”), which became effective January 1, 2020, makes it difficult for companies to retain independent contractors who operate in the same line of business as the Company.  A federal judge in California recently entered an order temporarily preventing AB 5 from taking effort for motor carriers. That litigation is ongoing, and likely will be unresolved for some time. Other states have considered similar statutes and there can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations resulting in the reclassification of the owner operators of the operations within our ArcBest segment as employees. In the event of such reclassification of these owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. These liabilities and additional costs could include exposure, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest and under vicarious liability principles, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our ArcBest segment.​We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships.​A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth or higher shipment levels, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate competitive contracts with railroads or other third-party service providers to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or obtain services at costs that are acceptable to us or our customers. If these situations occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships could be adversely impacted.​22Table of ContentsOur ability to secure the services of third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control, including the inability to obtain the services of reliable third parties at competitive prices; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators and drivers of contracted carriers for our ArcBest segment; shortages in available cargo capacity of third parties, including capacity constraints in the truckload market which we experienced during 2018; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in government regulations affecting the transportation industry and their related impact on operations, such as hours-of-service rules and the ELD mandate; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our ArcBest segment. ​Third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. These providers are subject to industry regulations that may have a significant impact on their operations, causing them to increase prices or exit the industry. Increased industry demand for these transportation services may reduce available capacity and such a reduction or other changes in these services offered by third parties may increase pricing or otherwise change the services we are able to offer to our customers. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, including the effect of third-party carrier rate increases outpacing customer pricing, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations, revenues, profitability and customer relationships. ​In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with the operations of our ArcBest segment, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are owner operators, independent contractors, or employees working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents or incidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries including death. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in contracting with them initially or retaining them over time. We or our subsidiaries could be held directly responsible for these third-party claims and, regardless of ultimate liability, may incur significant costs and expenses in defending these claims. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all.​We depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.​The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters; armed conflicts; terrorist attacks; actions by producers, including a decrease in drilling activity or the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production; legislation or regulations that require or result in new or alternate uses or other increase in the demand for fuel traditionally used by trucks; or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at our distribution centers and certain other service centers; however, we may experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules.​Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil and diesel, political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes that are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.​23Table of ContentsOur Asset-Based segment and certain operations of our ArcBest segment assess a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. Although fuel surcharge revenue generally offsets increases in direct diesel fuel costs when applied, we incur certain fuel costs that cannot be recovered with fuel surcharges, and other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of fuel costs through fuel surcharges, and the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. Further, during periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose lower pricing on compensatory fuel surcharges.​During periods of changing diesel fuel prices, the fuel surcharge and associated direct diesel fuel costs also vary by different degrees. Depending upon the rates of these changes and the impact on costs in other fuel- and energy-related areas, operating margins could be impacted. Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating results may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. Throughout 2019, the fuel surcharge mechanism generally continued to have market acceptance among our customers; however, certain nonstandard pricing arrangements have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. The negative impact on operating margins of capped fuel surcharge revenue during periods of increasing fuel costs is more evident when fuel prices remain above the maximum levels recovered through the fuel surcharge mechanism on certain accounts. Also, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture in any particular period the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially in periods in which fuel prices rapidly increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts the total billed revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment measure and, consequently, our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to the corresponding decline in our fuel costs. ​Our business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Various international, federal, state and local agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, operations of ocean freight forwarders and ocean transportation intermediaries, indirect air carriage, safety, contract compliance, insurance and bonding requirements, tariff and trade policies, customs, import and export, food safety, employment practices, licensing and registration, taxation, environmental matters, data privacy and security, and financial reporting. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions, drivers’ hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics, or cargo security. Increases in costs to comply with such regulations or the failure to comply, which could subject us to penalties or revocation of our permits or licenses, could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services.  Failure to comply with safety and security laws and regulations can result in both civil and criminal actions against the Company.  In addition to the potential harm to our reputation and brands, the financial burdens resulting from such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​We operate in the United States, and from the United States for international transportation, pursuant to federal operating authority granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission, and the Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Failures by us, or our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with the various applicable federal safety laws and regulations, or downgrades in our safety rating, could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose customers, as well as the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage.​24Table of ContentsOur ArcBest segment utilizes third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements, as previously mentioned. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on our ArcBest segment’s business and results of operations. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in governmental or third-party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to address or remedy, violations by them.​As a provider of worldwide transportation and logistics services, the Company collects and processes significant amounts of customer data on a daily basis. Recently, there have been global efforts by governments and consumer groups for increased transparency in how customer data is utilized and how customers can control the use and storage of their data. In 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) went into effect, which imposes strict new rules on controlling and processing customer data originating from the European Union. The State of California also passed an extensive consumer data protection law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”). Complying with new data protection laws and regulations, including the GDPR and the CCPA, may increase the Company’s compliance costs or require us to modify our data handling practices. Non-compliance could result in governmental or consumer actions against us and may otherwise adversely impact our reputation, operating results and financial condition. The uncertainty of the interpretation and enforcement of these laws, and their increasing scope and complexity, create regulatory risks that will likely increase over time.​Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations.​We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other areas: emission controls, transportation of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil. We may be subject to substantial fines or civil penalties if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required inspections and testing provisions. ​We routinely transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives. These operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, a spill or accident involving hazardous substances, and hazardous waste disposal.  In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury.​At certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel and oil in underground and aboveground tanks.  Our material handling and storage, fueling, equipment maintenance and cleaning subject us to the EPA underground storage tank regulations, the Clean Water Act oil pollution prevention and stormwater regulations, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration hazardous materials regulations. With regard to these areas, applicable regulatory requirements have several components including training, notification, inspection, testing, and operations and maintenance. ​Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any clean-up costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles. ​Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. ​Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal, state, and/or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future, including the Cleaner Trucks Initiative, which includes plans for future rulemaking to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation. However, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue 25Table of Contentsequipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions have also required vendors to introduce new engines and emissions technologies, and the maintenance demands and reliability of vehicles equipped with these newly designed engines, as well as the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, is uncertain. Such regulatory actions may also require changes in our operating practices and impair equipment productivity. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure, business, or results of operations. Furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services.​We could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans.​ABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. These multiemployer plans, established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT) and cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan in a relatively short period of time pursuant to an agreement. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan. ​The multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight’s obligations to these plans are generally specified in the 2018 ABF NMFA and other related supplemental agreements, which will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. The funding obligations to the multiemployer pension plans are intended to satisfy the requirements imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “PPA”), which was permanently extended by the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (the “Reform Act”). ABF Freight pays some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry and continues to address the effect of the Asset-Based segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results in discussions with the IBT. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. Future contribution rates will be determined through the negotiation process for contract periods following the term of the current collective bargaining agreement. We cannot determine with any certainty the minimum contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements or the impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition. ​Several of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded. The underfunded status of these plans developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved, if it can be achieved at all. In addition, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The reduction or loss of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk or instability in the financial markets on plan assets and liabilities, and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, all of which are beyond our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities, and our future contribution requirements. ​Based on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended December 31, 2018, approximately 57% of ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension plan contributions for the year ended December 31, 2019 were made to plans that are in “critical and declining status,” including the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan. “Critical and declining status” is applicable to critical status plans that are projected to become 26Table of Contentsinsolvent anytime within the next 14 plan years, or if the plan is projected to become insolvent within the next 19 plan years and either the plan’s ratio of inactive participants to active participants exceeds two to one or the plan’s funded percentage is less than 80%. Approximately 3% of ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in “critical status” (generally less than 65% funded) but not in “critical and declining status” and approximately 4% of its contributions are made to plans that are in “endangered status” (generally more than 65% but less than 80% funded), as defined by the PPA.​Approximately one half of ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension contributions are made to the Central States Pension Plan. The funded percentage of the Central States Pension Plan, as set forth in information provided by the Central States Pension Plan, was 27.2% and 37.8% as of January 1, 2018 and 2017, respectively. ABF Freight received a Notice of Critical and Declining Status for the Central States Pension Plan dated March 29, 2019, in which the plan’s actuary certified that, as of January 1, 2019, the plan is in critical and declining status, as defined by the Reform Act.  Although the future of the Central States Pension Plan is impacted by a number of factors, without legislative action, the plan is currently projected to become insolvent within 6 years. The 2018 ABF NMFA provides for contributions to the Central States Pension Plan through June 30, 2023, and ABF Freight’s contribution rate is not expected to increase during the remainder of this period (though there are no guarantees). ​We are subject to litigation risks, and at times may need to initiate litigation, which could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including class-action litigation and other legal proceedings brought by customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties, related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities, including damages, fines, penalties, and substantial legal and related costs, that may result from these claims and litigation. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost of, and ability to obtain, insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team.  Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings. ​We establish reserves based on our assessment of known legal matters and contingencies. New legal claims, or subsequent developments related to known legal claims, asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.​Our engagement of independent contractor drivers to provide a portion of the capacity for our ArcBest segment exposes us to different risks than we face with our employee drivers. If we have difficulty in securing independent owner operators, or if we incur increased costs to utilize independent owner operators, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected.​The driver fleet for portions of our ArcBest segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in owner operator compensation, our services may be less competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as these independent owner operators and individuals are third-party service providers, rather than our employees, they may decline loads of freight from time to time, which may impede our ability to deliver freight in a timely manner. If we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our ArcBest segment.​Additionally, we pay independent contractor drivers a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause the fuel surcharge we pay to independent contractors to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs, which could adversely impact the results of operations of our ArcBest segment.27Table of Contents​Our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​We benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of key employees or inability to execute our training and succession planning strategies could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business. ​Our corporate reputation and our business depend on a variety of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, patents, and licenses and other contractual rights.  If we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation, our brands, and other intellectual property rights, or if we face claims of infringement of third-party rights, our business may suffer.  The costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our rights or to defend against infringement claims could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​ArcBest is recognized as a multi-faceted logistics provider with creative problem solvers who deliver innovative logistics solutions. Beyond this fundamental marketplace recognition of our collective brand identity, our other key brands represent additional unique value in their target markets. The ABF Freight brand is well-recognized in the industry for our Asset-Based operations’ leadership in commitment to quality, customer service, safety, and technology. The Panther Premium Logistics brand within the operations of our ArcBest segment is recognized for solving the toughest shipping and logistics challenges, delivering time-sensitive, mission-critical, and high-value freight with speed and precision. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of our brands. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party contract carriers and their drivers and owner operators or other third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers’ image of our brands, including ArcBest, ABF Freight, Panther Premium Logistics, and U Pack, and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) issues, and similar matters, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Our business and our image could also be negatively impacted by a breach of our corporate policies by employees or vendors. Our business, including the moving services provided under our U-Pack brand, is increasingly dependent on the internet for attracting and securing customers, and the possibility that fraudulent behavior may confuse or deceive customers heightens the risk of damage to our reputation and increases the time and expense required to protect and maintain the integrity of our brands.  With the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands. ​We have registered or are pursuing registration of various marks and designs as trademarks in the United States, including but not limited to “ArcBest,” “ABF Freight,” “FleetNet America,” “Panther Premium Logistics,” “U-Pack,” “The Skill & The Will,” and “More Than Logistics.”  For some marks, we also have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service or trade names or logos or designs similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered trademarks. From time to time, we have acquired or attempted to acquire internet domain names held by others when such names have caused, or had the potential to cause, consumer confusion. Additionally, our business and operations utilize and depend upon both internally developed and purchased technology.  We have obtained or are pursuing patent protection on internally developed and certain purchased technology, including  equipment and process patents in connection with the pilot test program at ABF Freight.  Competitors or other third parties could attempt to reproduce or reverse-engineer our patented technologies, or we could be subject to third-party claims of infringement. Any of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property, whether owned or licensed, could be challenged or invalidated, or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our efforts to obtain, enforce, or protect our proprietary rights, or to defend against third-party infringement claims, may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. ​28Table of ContentsOur Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program contain customary financial covenants and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations.​Our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which governs our Credit Facility, contains representations and warranties, conditions, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Our accounts receivable securitization program also contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including a maximum adjusted leverage ratio and requirements to maintain certain characteristics of the receivables, such as rates of delinquency, default, and dilution. Failing to achieve certain financial ratios as required by our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.​If we default under the terms of the Credit Agreement or our accounts receivable securitization program and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. An event of a default under either of these facilities could constitute automatic default on the other of these facilities and could trigger cross-default provisions in our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or accounts receivable securitization program, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which the facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or one or both of the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if one or both of the facilities is terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be favorable or acceptable. A default under the Credit Agreement or accounts receivable securitization program, changes in regulations that impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements, or our inability to renew our financing arrangements with terms that are acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.​Our Credit Facility, accounts receivable securitization program, and interest rate swap agreements utilize interest rates based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (the “SOFR”) has been selected by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”) as its preferred replacement for LIBOR, and Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. In October 2018, the FASB amended ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to permit the SOFR Overnight Index Swap (“OIS”) Rate as a U.S. benchmark rate. Our Credit Agreement, which was amended and restated during the third quarter of 2019, provides for the use of an alternate rate of interest in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. We anticipate amending our other borrowing agreements, as and when appropriate, to allow for the use of an alternative to LIBOR in calculating the interest rate under such arrangements.  Any such changes to the terms of our borrowing agreements are anticipated to become effective in 2022 upon our agreement with lenders as to the replacement reference rate. It is our understanding that replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference in determining the interest rate under our borrowing arrangements will not have a significant impact on our cost of borrowing; however, there can be no assurances in this regard, as the new rates resulting from replacement of LIBOR in our borrowing arrangements may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, and we cannot be certain of what the impact of such a possible transition to SOFR or an alternative replacement reference rate may be on our liquidity and financial condition.​We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms or properly forecast capital needs to correspond with business volumes.​We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited; it may be necessary for us to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional financing or leasing arrangements, possibly on less favorable terms; or our revenue 29Table of Contentsequipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased expenditures for maintenance and reduced salvage value upon disposition of the assets. Forecasting business volumes involves many factors, including general economic trends and the impact of competition, which are subject to uncertainty and beyond our control. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, especially for revenue equipment, in relation to corresponding business levels, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity. In addition, our Credit Facility contains provisions that could limit our level of annual capital expenditures. If we were unable to properly forecast capital needs and/or were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, obtain adequate financing at acceptable terms, or if our capital spending was otherwise limited, there could be an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth. ​Claims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance, including medical plans, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​Claims may be asserted against us for accidents or for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation related to events occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize, for our actions in retaining their services, for loss or damage to our customers’ goods or other damages for which we are alleged or may be determined to be responsible. Such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we have established liabilities that are adjusted to reflect our claims experience, actual claims costs and legal expenses may exceed our estimates. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. ​We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss and damage claims for the operations of our Asset-Based segment and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event. Our self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if we were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, our insurance costs or collateral requirements could materially increase, or we could experience difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums or deductibles in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.​We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty liability. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future, which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements. ​Material increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, claims experience, current and future federal and state laws and regulations, and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. In particular, with the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), we are required to provide health care benefits to all full-time employees that meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria set forth in the PPACA. The PPACA also requires individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties, so employees who are currently eligible but have elected not to participate in our health care plans may ultimately find it more advantageous to do so. In general, implementing the requirements of health care reform has imposed additional administrative costs. The costs of maintaining and monitoring compliance and reports and other effects of these new healthcare requirements, including any failure to comply, may significantly increase our health care coverage costs and could materially adversely 30Table of Contentsaffect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in healthcare legislation could potentially occur in the near term, which could result in changes to healthcare eligibility, design, and cost structure that could have an adverse impact on our business and operating costs; however, we cannot currently determine the impact of future regulatory action on our health care plans and the related costs.​Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.​In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations as well as fuel costs. A number of states have mandated, and California and certain other states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment, which could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner operators for portions of our ArcBest segment operations, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices, which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry, which could lead to a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  ​A general reduction in fuel demand due to improved fuel economy may result in legislative efforts to increase fuel taxes, which, if enacted, could increase our costs. If we are not able to offset fuel tax increases through reductions in other excise taxes or through increases in the rates we charge our customers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.​We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations, which may be difficult to procure in the event of decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. At times, market forces may create market situations in which demand outstrips supply. In those situations, we may face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers, as well as related parts and services, for our Asset-Based operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. ​During prolonged periods of decreased business levels, we and other trucking companies may make strategic fleet reductions, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. When the supply exceeds the demand for used revenue equipment, the general market value of used revenue equipment decreases. Used equipment prices are also subject to substantial fluctuations based on availability of financing and commodity prices for scrap metal. If market prices for used revenue equipment decline, corresponding decreases in our established salvage values on equipment being used in our Asset-Based operations would increase our depreciation expense, and we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.​Our total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected.​As of December 31, 2019, we had recorded goodwill of $88.3 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $58.8 million. Our goodwill and intangible assets are primarily associated with acquisitions in the ArcBest segment. Our annual impairment evaluations for 2019 indicated an impairment of certain of these balances and, as a result, we recorded a noncash impairment related to goodwill and finite-lived customer relationship intangible assets of $20.0 million (pre-tax) and $6.0 million (pre-tax), respectively. (See Note D to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the impairment charge.) The 31Table of Contentsimpairment resulted primarily from underperformance of the truckload and truckload-dedicated businesses of the ArcBest segment, which was driven by economic conditions and the effect of excess truckload market capacity on margins during 2019. The resulting declines in shipment and pricing trends negatively impacted the revenue growth rates and cash flows projected for these businesses for purposes of the annual impairment tests. Significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of our reporting units could result in further impairment and noncash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​We may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any recent or future acquisitions.​As part of our long-term strategy to ensure we are positioned to serve our customers within the changing marketplace by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, we have strategically invested in our Asset-Light businesses through acquisitions, most recently in 2016 and 2015. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks that may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Further, we may not be able to acquire any additional companies at all or on terms favorable to us, even though we may have incurred expenses in evaluating and pursuing strategic transactions. ​Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or earnings from the operation of an acquired business to offset our acquisition or investment costs, and the acquired business may otherwise fail to meet our operational or strategic expectations. The degree of success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends, in part, upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses. ​The possible risks involved in acquisitions, including potential difficulties of integration include, among others:​●retention of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers; ●combining operations of the companies, including the integration of workforces at different locations while continuing to provide consistent, high-quality service to customers;●unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information technology, communications, and other systems, including additional systems training and other labor inefficiencies; ●consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; ●difficulties and costs of on-boarding employees to our policies, procedures, business culture, and benefits and compensation programs, which may be inconsistent with those of the acquired company; ●difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency; ●inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new markets or geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them, including additional or unanticipated regulatory and compliance issues; ●the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; ●increased tax liability or other tax risk if future earnings are less than anticipated or there is a change in the tax deductibility of certain items; and●other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities, including previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no, or are unable to secure, recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. ​The risks involved in successful integration could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. The diversion of management’s attention from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support the acquisitions, could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated from the acquisitions, and within the anticipated timeframe, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future.​32Table of ContentsOur business and results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions, and natural disasters.​Our operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations that affect tonnage and shipment levels, and demand for our services and, consequently, revenues and operating results. Freight shipments and operating costs of our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The first quarter of each year generally has the lowest tonnage levels, although other factors, including the state of the U.S. and global economies, may influence quarterly freight tonnage levels. At the same time, first quarter operating expenses may increase due to, among other things, a decline in fuel economy because of higher fuel density in colder temperatures, higher accident frequency, increased claims, and potentially higher equipment repair expenditures caused by harsh weather. ArcBest segment operations are influenced by seasonal fluctuations that impact customers’ supply chains and the resulting demand for expedited services. Expedite shipments of our ArcBest segment may decline due to post-holiday slowdowns during winter months and plant shutdowns during summer months. Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are influenced by seasonal variations in service event volume, which is generally lower during mild weather conditions. Business levels of the household goods moving services provided by our ArcBest segment are generally lower in the non-summer months when demand for moving services is typically lower. In addition to the impact of weather on seasonal business trends, severe weather events and natural disasters, such as harsh winter weather, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or third-party service providers, damage our infrastructure, destroy our assets, affect regional economies, or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, each of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and business levels and, consequently, our operating results.​We are subject to certain risks arising from our international business.​We provide transportation and logistics services to and from a number of international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, changes in the economic strength of certain foreign countries; social, political, and economic instability; the ability to secure space or services from third-party aircraft, ocean vessels, and other modes of transportation or suppliers; burdens of complying with a wide variety of domestic and international laws and regulations, including export and import laws as well as different liability standards and less-developed legal systems; unexpected changes in foreign laws, regulations, trade, monetary or fiscal policy; changes in or enactment of tariffs, quotas, customs and other restrictions and trade barriers; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and changes in foreign exchange rates. Additional risks associated with our international business include restrictive trade policies and trade wars, new or increased trade tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by foreign governments, and changes in international tax laws and regulations. In addition, natural disasters, pandemics, war, acts of terrorism, and insurrections could impede our ability to provide satisfactory services to customers in international locations.​We are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and hold Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) status for businesses within our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments. Failure to comply with the FCPA and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in criminal and civil penalties against us. If we are unable to maintain our C-TPAT status, we may face a loss of certain business due to customer requirements to deal only with C-TPAT participating carriers, because of the enhanced levels of supply chain security provided by participating in the C-TPAT program. In addition, loss of C-TPAT status may result in significant border delays, which could cause our international operations to be less efficient and more costly than competitors also operating internationally. ​We operate in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces, and we operate in Mexico by utilizing third-party carriers within the country. If the United States enters into, withdraws from or materially modifies international trade agreements, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement once ratified by Canada, or other trade agreements or border policies, there could be more restrictive trade policies or increased regulatory complexities, which may result in increased costs and/or a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by our customers. Any such changes in trade policies and corresponding actions by other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.​33Table of ContentsFuture acts of terrorism or war may cause significant disruptions in our operations and our business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures.​Terrorist attacks or acts of war, along with any government response to such events, may cause significant disruptions in our operations and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Our Asset-Based revenue equipment, as well as the owner operator fleet and contract carriers utilized in our Asset-Light operations, key infrastructure, and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terrorism or war. As a result of actual or threatened terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented, continue to implement, and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. If security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so. Additional security measures may also reduce productivity of our drivers and third-party transportation service providers, which would increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance regarding the implementation of new antiterrorism measures and such new measures may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.​​"
10,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2019-02-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS The nature of the business activities we conduct subjects us to certain hazards and risks. This Risk Factors
 section discusses some of the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry in general, as well as risks specific to our Company that are largely out of our control. Other risks are described in “Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) and in Part II, Item 7A (Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are not the only risks we face. We may also be negatively impacted by a sustained interruption in our systems or operations, including, but not limited to, infrastructure damage, the loss of a key location such as a distribution center, or a significant disruption to the electric grid, or by a significant decline in demand for our services, each of which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; changes in the social, political, and regulatory conditions in the United States; and/or other market disruptions. We could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occur, it could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In such cases, the market price of our common stock could decline.We are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure or cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We depend on the proper functioning, availability and security of our information systems, including communications, data processing, financial, and operating systems, as well as proprietary software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. Our information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control.  Any significant failure or other disruption in our critical information systems, including cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents, that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that result in proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others, being compromised could have a significant impact on our operations. Any new or enhanced technology that we may develop and implement may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and may be more prone to related incidents. We also utilize certain software applications provided by third parties and provide underlying data which is utilized by third parties who provide certain outsourced administrative functions, either of which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Any problems caused by or impacting these third parties, including cyber attacks and security breaches at a vendor, could adversely affect our ability to provide service to our customers and otherwise conduct our business.  A significant disruption in our information technology systems or a significant cyber incident, including denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees or vendors with access to our systems or data, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks through our technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. Our business interruption and cyber insurance would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe or certain cyber incidents; however, losses arising from a catastrophe or significant cyber incident would likely exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.   15 Table of ContentsWe have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service attacks, malware attacks, and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. To date, the systems employed have been effective in identifying these types of events at a point when the impact on our business could be minimized. We must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that could have a security impact.  Despite our efforts, due to the increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and the development of new techniques for attack, we may be unable to anticipate or promptly detect, or implement adequate protective or remedial measures against, the activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. We engage third parties to provide certain information technology needs, including licensed software, and the inability to maintain these third-party systems or licenses, or any interruptions or failures thereof, could adversely affect our business.  Certain information technology needs are provided by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems depends upon the internet, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers (terrestrial, cellular and satellite); and the information technology systems of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, or in other services provided to us by outside service providers upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that supports our operations, and these operations depend on our ability to maintain these licenses. We have no guarantees that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology, we may suffer competitive disadvantage, loss of customers or other consequences that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. The industry has experienced rapid changes in technology, including the development of new technology and enhancements in existing technology. As technology improves, our customers may be able to find alternatives to our services to meet their freight transportation and logistics needs.  New entrants to the market, including start-ups and emerging technologies such as digital freight exchanges, have also expanded the field of competition and driven an increased pressure for innovation in the industry.   Technology and new market entrants may also disrupt the way we, and our competitors, operate to provide freight logistics services.  We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions from their suppliers, and we believe that we must respond by investing in the enhancement of existing technology and in the development of new and innovative solutions to improve efficiencies and meet our customers’ needs.  We have made, and continue to make, significant investments in software and physical assets that are in various stages of development and implementation.  Our efforts and investments in technology innovation may require significant ongoing research and development costs and implementation costs, and may involve potential unforeseen challenges and new or unforeseen risks associated with the technology.  The success of our approach to technology innovation is dependent upon market acceptance of our solutions and a number of other factors, including our ability to: ·deploy funds and resources for investment in technology and innovation;  ·achieve the right balance of strategic investments in existing technology and new technology and innovation; ·timely and effectively develop and implement new or enhanced technology, including integration into current operations and interaction with existing technology systems;  ·train our employees to operate the technology;  ·adequately anticipate challenges and respond to unforeseen challenges;  ·detect and remedy defects in the enhanced or new technology; and ·recover costs of investment through increased business levels, higher prices, improved efficiencies or other means. 16 Table of Contents If we fail to successfully develop and deploy enhanced or new technology, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, lose customers, incur higher than anticipated costs, including the possible impact of asset impairment, or fail to meet the goals of our internal growth strategy, any one of which could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. The loss or reduction in business from one or more large customers, or an overall reduction in our customer base, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Although we do not have a significant customer concentration, the growth of our business could be materially impacted and our results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if we were to lose all or a portion of the business of some of our large customers because they: choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors; demand pricing concessions for our services; require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs; or develop their own shipping and distribution capabilities.  Our customer relationships are generally not subject to long-term contractual obligations or minimum volume commitments, and we cannot ensure that our current customer relationships will continue at the same business levels or at all.   A reduction in our customer base or difficulty in collecting, or the inability to collect, payments from our customers due to changes in pricing or other competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability, growth prospects, and ability to compete in the transportation industry. We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. We compete with LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. We also compete with domestic and global logistics service providers, including asset-light logistics companies, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers, which compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. These competitive factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  ·Some of our competitors have greater capital resources, a lower cost structure, or greater market share than we do or have other competitive advantages. The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger carriers and logistics service providers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size, including increased market share and stronger competitive position. Consolidations within the industry could also result in our competitors providing a more comprehensive set of services at competitive prices. These competitive pressures may cause a decrease in our freight volume or shipment levels or require us to lower the prices we charge for our services, which could adversely affect our results of operations, growth prospects and profitability. ·Our Asset-Based segment competes primarily with nonunion motor carriers who generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure than union carriers for freight-handling and driving personnel, and  have greater operating flexibility because they are subject to less stringent labor work rules. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors have allowed for a lower cost structure than that of our Asset-Based segment. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight System, Inc. (“ABF Freight”) continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact the operating results of our Asset-Based segment relative to our competitors in the LTL industry. ·Some of our competitors, such as railroads, are outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry and certain challenges specific to the motor carrier freight transportation industry, including the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; changes to driver hours-of-service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations, could result in the service offerings of these competitors being more competitive. 17 Table of Contents ·Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels. ·Customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors. ·Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. ·Certain of our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete. ·The industry has experienced evolving freight shipping trends over the last several years, including overall growth and ongoing profile shift of bulkier shipments across the entire supply chain, the acceleration in e-commerce, and more unique requirements of many shipping and logistics solutions. An increasing percentage of freight is taking up more space in trailers without a corresponding increase in weight, which contributes to lower average weight per shipment. As the retail industry continues to undergo a shift away from the traditional brick-and-mortar model towards e-commerce, the manner in which our customers source or utilize our services will be impacted and our operating results could be adversely affected. ·Competition in the LTL industry from asset-light logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect customer relationships and prices in our Asset-Based operations. Conversely, the operations of our ArcBest segment may be adversely impacted if customers develop their own logistics operations, thus reducing demand for our services, or if shippers shift business to truckload brokerage companies or asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies’ trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight capacity industry-wide.  ·Our FleetNet operations also face a competitive disadvantage from companies which insource their fleet repair and maintenance services. We depend on our employees to support our business operations and future growth opportunities. If our relationship with our employees deteriorates, if we have difficulty attracting and retaining employees, or if our Asset-Based segment is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. As of December 2018, approximately 82% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT which will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. If we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs. The terms of any future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may also result in higher labor costs, insufficient operational flexibility which may increase our operating costs, a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages.  With the exception of certain geographic markets, we have not historically experienced significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers, technicians and freight-handling personnel for our Asset-Based operations, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage or shipment levels. Additionally, the available pool of drivers and technicians has been declining, which may cause us difficulty in retaining and hiring qualified drivers and other personnel. Both our profitability and our ability to grow could be adversely affected if we encounter difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, technicians and freight-handling personnel or if we become subject to contractually required increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions that result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the Company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business.   18 Table of ContentsOur ability to maintain and grow our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to retain and attract additional sales representatives and other key operational personnel and properly incentivize them to obtain new customers, maintain existing customer relationships, and efficiently manage our business. If we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and operational workforce, our ability to increase our revenues and operate our business could be negatively impacted. Our initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful. Developing service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. Hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary labor inefficiencies. In addition, as we focus on growing the business in our ArcBest segment, we may encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments, which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors and in which we will encounter new competitive challenges, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels, as portions of salaries, wages, and benefits are fixed in nature and the adjustments which would otherwise be necessary to align the labor cost structure to corresponding business levels are limited as we strive to maintain customer service. We may not be able to appropriately adjust our cost structure to changing market demands. It is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in periods of rapid or unexpected change. We may incur additional costs related to purchased transportation and/or experience labor inefficiencies while, and for a time following, training employees who are hired in response to growth. These costs of managing our cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We periodically evaluate and modify the network of our Asset-Based operations to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile the segment’s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that these network changes, to the extent such network changes are made, will result in a material improvement in our Asset-Based segment’s results of operations. Our business is cyclical in nature, and we are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions, which can be impacted by government actions, including suspension of government operations. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case primarily in the North American economy, and capacity in the trucking industry as well as our customers’ inventory levels and freight profile characteristics. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight in the markets we serve and related pricing. Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. Our operations and the rates we obtain for our services may also be negatively impacted when economic conditions lead to a decrease in shipping demand, which in turn results in excess tractor and trailer capacity in the industry. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads.   19 Table of ContentsEconomic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, thus negatively impacting our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our cost structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend credit to certain of these customers which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.  Given the economic conditions of recent years, current economic uncertainties, and the potential impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the pricing environment and economic conditions, which are made for purposes of impairment tests related to operating assets and deferred tax assets, will prove to be accurate.  We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our borrowings on the accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”). Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $70.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2019, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization program, new notes payable or capital lease arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. (See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.) As of December 31, 2018, our qualified nonunion defined benefit pension plan trust held investments in cash equivalents and income securities totaling $26.6 million, which are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices and are subject to market risk. Although these investments were primarily held in money market mutual funds as of December 31, 2018, declines in the value of plan assets resulting from instability in the financial markets, general economic downturn, or other economic factors beyond our control could cause a decline in the funded status of the nonunion defined benefit pension plan and potentially require an increase in the contribution we may be required to make to fund the purchase of a nonparticipating annuity contract to settle the remaining obligation for plan benefits in excess of plan assets upon liquidation of the plan in first quarter 2019. (See Note I to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of termination of our nonunion defined benefit pension plan.) We could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or political and/or civil unrest on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition.  We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships. A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth or higher shipment levels, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our  20 Table of Contentscustomers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate competitive contracts with railroads or other third-party service providers to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or obtain services at costs that are acceptable to us or our customers. If these situations occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships could be adversely impacted. Our ability to secure the services of third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control, including the inability to obtain the services of reliable third parties at competitive prices; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators and drivers of contracted carriers for our ArcBest segment; shortages in available cargo capacity of third parties, including capacity constraints in the truckload market which we experienced during 2018; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in government regulations affecting the transportation industry and their related impact on operations, such as hours-of-service rules and the ELD mandate discussed in “Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our ArcBest segment.  Third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. These providers are subject to industry regulations which may have a significant impact on their operations, causing them to increase prices or exit the industry. Increased industry demand for these transportation services may reduce available capacity and such a reduction or other changes in these services offered by third parties may increase pricing or otherwise change the services we are able to offer to our customers. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, including the effect of third-party carrier rate increases outpacing customer pricing, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations, revenues, profitability and customer relationships.  In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with the operations of our ArcBest segment, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are owner operators, independent contractors, or employees working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents or incidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries including death. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in contracting with them initially or retaining them over time. The Company or its subsidiaries could be held directly responsible for these third-party claims and, regardless of ultimate liability, may incur significant costs and expenses in defending these claims. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. Our business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, operations of ocean freight forwarders and ocean transportation intermediaries, indirect air carriage, safety, contract compliance, insurance and bonding requirements, tariff and trade policies, customs, import and export, food safety, employment practices, licensing and registration, taxation, environmental matters, data privacy and security, and financial reporting. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions, drivers’ hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics, or cargo security. Increases in costs to comply with such regulations or the failure to comply, which could subject us to penalties or revocation of our permits or licenses, could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services.  Failure to comply with safety and security laws and regulations can result in both civil and criminal actions against the Company.  In addition to the potential harm to our reputation and brands, the financial burdens resulting from such actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  21 Table of ContentsWe operate in the United States, and from the United States for international transportation, pursuant to federal operating authority granted by the DOT, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission and the Transportation Security Administration, which is now part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Failures by us, or our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with the various applicable federal safety laws and regulations, or downgrades in our safety rating, could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose customers, as well as the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage. Our ArcBest segment utilizes third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements, as previously mentioned. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on our ArcBest segment’s business and results of operations. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in governmental or third-party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to address or remedy, violations by them. As a worldwide transportation and logistics provider, the Company collects and processes significant amounts of customer data on a daily basis. Recently, there have been global efforts by governments and consumer groups for increased transparency in how customer data is utilized and how customers can control the use and storage of their data. In 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect, which imposes strict new rules on controlling and processing customer data originating from the European Union. The State of California also passed an extensive consumer data protection law. Complying with new data protection laws and regulations, including the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, may increase the Company’s compliance costs or require us to modify our data handling practices. Non-compliance could result in governmental or consumer actions against us and may otherwise adversely impact our reputation, operating results and financial condition. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other areas: emission controls, transportation of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil. We may be subject to substantial fines or civil penalties if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required inspections and testing provisions.  We routinely transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives. These operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, a spill or accident involving hazardous substances, and hazardous waste disposal.  In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury. At certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel and oil in underground and aboveground tanks.  Our material handling and storage, fueling, equipment maintenance and cleaning subject us to the Clean Water Act stormwater regulations.   With regard to these areas, applicable regulatory requirements have several components including training, notification, inspection, testing, and operations and maintenance.  Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any clean-up costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles.  Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  22 Table of Contents Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal, state, and/or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future, including the CTI which includes plans for future rulemaking to reduce NOx emissions. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation. However, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions have also required vendors to introduce new engines and emissions technologies, and the maintenance demands and reliability of vehicles equipped with these newly designed engines, as well as the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, is uncertain. Such regulatory actions may also require changes in our operating practices and impair equipment productivity. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure, business, or results of operations. Furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services. We could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans. ABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. ABF Freight’s contributions generally are based on the time worked by its contractual employees in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement with the IBT and other related supplemental agreements. The multiemployer plans to which ABF Freight contributes, which have been established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT) and cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan in a relatively short period of time pursuant to an agreement. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan.  The 25 multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight’s obligations to these plans are generally specified in the 2018 ABF NMFA, which will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. The funding obligations to the multiemployer pension plans are intended to satisfy the requirements imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2016 (the “PPA”), which was permanently extended by the Reform Act under the CFCAA. ABF Freight pays some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry and continues to address the effect of the Asset-Based segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results in discussions with the IBT. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. Future contribution rates will be determined through the negotiation process for contract periods following the term of the current collective bargaining agreement.  We cannot determine with any certainty the minimum contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements or the impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.  Several of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded. The underfunded status of these plans developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved, if it can be achieved at all. In addition, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The reduction or loss of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk or instability in the financial markets on plan assets and liabilities, and  23 Table of Contentsthe effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, all of which are beyond our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities, and our future contribution requirements.  Based on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended December 31, 2017, approximately 62% of ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in “critical and declining status”, including the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the “Central States Pension Plan”) and the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund (the “New England Pension Fund”). “Critical and declining status” is applicable to critical status plans under the PPA that are projected to become insolvent anytime within the next 14 plan years, or if the plan is projected to become insolvent within the next 19 plan years and either the plan’s ratio of inactive participants to active participants exceeds two to one or the plan’s funded percentage is less than 80%. Approximately 2% of ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in “critical status” (generally less than 65% funded) but not in “critical and declining status” and approximately 4% of its contributions are made to plans that are in “endangered status” (generally more than 65% but less than 80% funded), as defined by the PPA. Approximately one-half of ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension contributions are made to the Central States Pension Plan. The funded percentage of the Central States Pension Plan, as set forth in information provided by the Central States Pension Plan, was 37.8% and 42.1% as of January 1, 2017 and 2016, respectively. ABF Freight received an Actuarial Certification of Plan Status for the Central States Pension Plan dated March 30, 2018, in which the plan’s actuary certified that, as of January 1, 2018, the plan is in critical and declining status, as defined by the Reform Act.  Although the future of the Central States Pension Plan is impacted by a number of factors, without legislative action, the plan is currently projected to become insolvent within 10 years or less. The 2018 ABF NMFA provides for contributions to the Central States Pension Plan through June 30, 2023, and ABF Freight’s contribution rate is not expected to increase during the remainder of this period (though there are no guarantees).  Our engagement of independent contractor drivers to provide a portion of the capacity for our ArcBest segment exposes us to different risks than we face with our employee drivers. If we have difficulty in securing independent owner operators, or if we incur increased costs to utilize independent owner operators, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The driver fleet for portions of our ArcBest segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in owner operator compensation, our services may be less competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as these independent owner operators and individuals are third-party service providers, rather than our employees, they may decline loads of freight from time to time, which may impede our ability to deliver freight in a timely manner. If we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our ArcBest segment. Additionally, we pay independent contractor drivers a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause the fuel surcharge we pay to independent contractors to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs, which could adversely impact the results of operations of our ArcBest segment. If the independent contractors we contract with are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, or if we experience operational or regulatory issues related to our use of these contract drivers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The transportation and logistics industry’s heavy dependence on independent contractors for providing services has made it a target of litigation. Class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in the industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. Many states have enacted restrictive laws that make it difficult to successfully prove independent-contractor status, and all states have enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors.  There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of  24 Table of Contentsexisting rules and regulations resulting in the reclassification of the owner operators of the operations within our ArcBest segment as employees. In the event of such reclassification of these owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. These liabilities and additional costs could include exposure, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest and under vicarious liability principles, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our ArcBest segment. We are subject to litigation risks that could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including class-action litigation and other legal proceedings brought by customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties, related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities, including damages, fines, penalties, and substantial legal and related costs, that may result from these claims and litigation. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost of, and ability to obtain, insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team.  Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings.  We establish reserves based on our assessment of known legal matters and contingencies. New legal claims, or subsequent developments related to known legal claims, asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our corporate reputation and our business depend on a variety of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, patents, and licenses and other contractual rights.  If we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation, our brands, and other intellectual property rights, or if we face claims of infringement of third-party rights, our business may suffer.  The costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our rights or to defend against infringement claims could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. ArcBest is recognized as a multi-faceted logistics provider with creative problem solvers who deliver integrated logistics solutions. Beyond this fundamental marketplace recognition of our collective brand identity, our other key brands represent additional unique value in their target markets. The ABF Freight brand is well-recognized in the industry for our Asset-Based operations’ leadership in commitment to quality, customer service, safety, and technology. The Panther Premium Logistics brand within the operations of our ArcBest segment is recognized for solving the toughest shipping and logistics challenges, delivering time-sensitive, mission-critical, and high-value freight with speed and precision. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of our brands. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party contract carriers and their drivers and owner operators or other third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers’ image of our brands, including ArcBest, ABF Freight, Panther Premium Logistics, and U‑Pack, and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, environmental concerns, and similar matters, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Our business and our image could also be negatively impacted by a breach of our corporate policies by employees or vendors. Portions of our business, such as the moving services provided under our U-Pack brand, are dependent on the internet for attracting and securing customers, and the possibility that fraudulent behavior may confuse or deceive customers heightens the risk of damage to our reputation and increases the time and expense required to protect and maintain the integrity of our brands.  With the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.   25 Table of ContentsWe have registered or are pursuing registration of various marks and designs as trademarks in the United States, including but not limited to “ArcBest,” “ABF Freight,” “FleetNet America,” “Panther Premium Logistics,” “U-Pack,” “The Skill & The Will,” and “More Than Logistics.”  For some marks, we also have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service or trade names or logos or designs similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered trademarks. From time to time, we have acquired or attempted to acquire internet domain names held by others when such names have caused, or had the potential to cause, consumer confusion. Additionally, our business and operations utilize and depend upon both internally developed and purchased technology, either of which could be infringed upon, or subject to claims of infringement.  Any of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property, whether owned or licensed, could be challenged or invalidated, or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our efforts to obtain, enforce, or protect our proprietary rights, or to defend against a third-party infringement claim, may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of key employees or inability to execute our training and succession planning strategies could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business.  Our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program contain customary financial covenants and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which governs our Credit Facility, contains representations and warranties, conditions, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Our accounts receivable securitization program also contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including a maximum adjusted leverage ratio and requirements to maintain certain characteristics of the receivables, such as rates of delinquency, default, and dilution. Failing to achieve certain financial ratios as required by our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. If we default under the terms of the Credit Agreement or our accounts receivable securitization program and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. An event of a default under either of these facilities could constitute automatic default on the other of these facilities and could trigger cross-default provisions in our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or accounts receivable securitization program, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which the facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or one or both of the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if one or both of the facilities is terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be acceptable. A default under the Credit Agreement or accounts receivable securitization program, changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements, or our inability to renew our financing arrangements with terms that are acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.  26 Table of ContentsWe have significant ongoing capital requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms or properly forecast capital needs to correspond with business volumes. We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited; it may be necessary for us to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional financing or leasing arrangements, possibly on less favorable terms; or our revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased expenditures for maintenance and reduced salvage value upon disposition of the assets. Forecasting business volumes involves many factors, including general economic trends and the impact of competition, which are subject to uncertainty and beyond our control. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, especially for revenue equipment, in relation to corresponding business levels, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity. In addition, our Credit Facility contains provisions that could limit our level of annual capital expenditures. If we were unable to properly forecast capital needs and/or were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, obtain adequate financing at acceptable terms, or if our capital spending was otherwise limited, there could be an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth.  Claims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance, including medical plans, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Claims may be asserted against us for accidents or for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation related to events occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize, for our actions in retaining their services, for loss or damage to our customers’ goods or other damages for which we are determined to be responsible. Such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we have established liabilities which are adjusted to reflect our claims experience, actual claims costs and legal expenses may exceed our estimates. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results.  We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss and damage claims for the operations of our Asset-Based segment and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event. Our self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if we were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, our insurance costs or collateral requirements could materially increase, or we could experience difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums or deductibles in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Material increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, claims experience, current and future federal and state laws and regulations, and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. In particular, with the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), we are required to provide health care benefits to all full-time employees that meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria set forth in the PPACA. The PPACA also requires individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties, so employees who are currently eligible but have elected not to participate in our health care plans may ultimately find it more advantageous to do so. In general, implementing the requirements of health care reform has imposed additional administrative costs. The costs of maintaining and monitoring compliance and reports and other effects of these new healthcare requirements, including any failure to comply, may significantly increase our health care coverage costs and could materially adversely  27 Table of Contentsaffect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in healthcare legislation could potentially occur in the near term, which could result in changes to healthcare eligibility, design, and cost structure that could have an adverse impact on our business and operating costs; however, we cannot currently determine the impact of future regulatory action on our health care plans and the related costs. We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty liability. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements.  We may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any recent or future acquisitions. As part of our long-term strategy to ensure we are positioned to serve our customers within the changing marketplace by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, we have strategically invested in our Asset-Light businesses through acquisitions, most recently in 2016 and 2015. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks which may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Further, we may not be able to acquire any additional companies at all or on terms favorable to us, even though we may have incurred expenses in evaluating and pursuing the strategic transactions.  Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or earnings from the operation of an acquired business to offset our acquisition or investment costs, and the acquired business may otherwise fail to meet our operational or strategic expectations. The degree of success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends, in part, upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses.  The possible risks involved in acquisitions, including potential difficulties of integration include, among others:  ·retention of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers;  ·combining operations of the companies, including the integration of workforces at different locations while continuing to provide consistent, high-quality service to customers; ·unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information technology, communications, and other systems, including additional systems training and other labor inefficiencies;  ·consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures;  ·difficulties and costs of on-boarding employees to our policies, procedures, business culture, and benefits and compensation programs, which may be inconsistent with those of the acquired company;  ·difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency;  ·inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new markets or geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them, including additional or unanticipated regulatory and compliance issues;  ·the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;  ·increased tax liability or other tax risk if future earnings are less than anticipated or there is a change in the tax deductibility of certain items; and ·other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities, including previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no, or are unable to secure, recourse under applicable indemnification provisions.   28 Table of ContentsThe risks involved in successful integration could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. The diversion of management’s attention from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support the acquisitions, could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated from the acquisitions, and within the anticipated timeframe, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future. We depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters; armed conflicts; terrorist attacks; actions by producers, including a decrease in drilling activity or the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production; legislation or regulations that require or result in new or alternate uses or other increase in the demand for fuel traditionally used by trucks; or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at our distribution centers and certain other service centers; however, we may experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules. Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil and diesel, political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters. Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes which are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our Asset-Based segment and certain operations of our ArcBest segment assess a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. Although fuel surcharge revenue generally offsets increases in direct diesel fuel costs when applied, we incur certain fuel costs that cannot be recovered with fuel surcharges, and other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of fuel costs through fuel surcharges, and the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. Further, during periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose lower pricing on compensatory fuel surcharges. During periods of changing diesel fuel prices, the fuel surcharge and associated direct diesel fuel costs also vary by different degrees. Depending upon the rates of these changes and the impact on costs in other fuel- and energy-related areas, operating margins could be impacted. Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating results may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. Throughout 2018, the fuel surcharge mechanism generally continued to have market acceptance among our customers; however, certain nonstandard pricing arrangements have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. The negative impact on operating margins of capped fuel surcharge revenue during periods of increasing fuel costs is more evident when fuel prices remain above the maximum levels recovered through the fuel surcharge mechanism on certain accounts. Also, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture in any particular period the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially in periods in which fuel prices rapidly increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts the total billed revenue per hundredweight or revenue per shipment measure and, consequently, our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to the corresponding decline in our fuel costs.  29 Table of Contents Higher fuel prices also cause customers of our FleetNet segment to seek cost savings throughout their businesses which may result in a reduction of miles driven and/or a deferral of maintenance practices that may reduce the volume of our maintenance service events, resulting in an adverse impact on the segment’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations as well as fuel costs. A number of states have mandated, and California and certain other states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner operators for portions of our ArcBest segment operations, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry which could lead to a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.   Reduced fuel demand due to improved fuel economy may result in legislative efforts to increase fuel taxes which, if enacted, could increase our costs. If we are not able to offset fuel tax increases through reductions in other excise taxes or through increases in the rates we charge our customers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations, which may be difficult to procure in the event of decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. At times, market forces may create market situations in which demand outstrips supply. In those situations, we may face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers, as well as related parts and services, for our Asset-Based operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  During prolonged periods of decreased business levels, we and other trucking companies may make strategic fleet reductions, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. When the supply exceeds the demand for used revenue equipment, the general market value of used revenue equipment decreases. Used equipment prices are also subject to substantial fluctuations based on availability of financing and commodity prices for scrap metal. If market prices for used revenue equipment decline, corresponding decreases in our established salvage values on equipment being used in our Asset-Based operations would increase our depreciation expense, and we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  30 Table of ContentsOur total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2018, we had recorded goodwill of $108.3 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $68.9 million. Our goodwill and intangible assets resulted primarily from acquisitions in the ArcBest segment. Our annual impairment evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2018, 2017, and 2016 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances. However, significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of our reporting units could result in impairment and a resulting non-cash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our nonunion defined benefit pension plan could have greater than anticipated funding requirements, which may adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. As further discussed in Note I to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our nonunion defined benefit pension plan was terminated with an effective date of December 31, 2017 and the plan received a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding qualification of the plan termination in September 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the plan began distributing immediate lump sum benefits elected by plan participants under plan termination. The plan will settle the remaining obligation for deferred benefits with the purchase of nonparticipating annuity contracts from insurance companies in first quarter 2019. The Company will make a cash contribution to the plan for the amount, if any, required to fund benefit distributions and annuity contract purchases in excess of plan assets.  We estimate nonunion pension expense, including noncash pension settlement charges, could total approximately $4.0 million in first quarter 2019, and cash funding could total approximately $7.0 million in first quarter 2019, although there can be no assurances in this regard. The final pension settlement charges and the actual amount we will be required to contribute to the plan to fund benefit distributions in excess of plan assets are dependent on various factors, including the value of plan assets, the amount of lump-sum benefit distributions paid to participants, and the cost to purchase annuity contracts to settle the pension obligation related to benefits for which participants elect to defer payment until a later date. Our results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions, and natural disasters. Our operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels, and demand for our services and, consequently, revenues and operating results. Freight shipments and operating costs of our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The first quarter of each year generally has the lowest tonnage levels, although other factors, including the state of the U.S. and global economies, may influence quarterly freight tonnage levels. At the same time, first quarter operating expenses may increase due to, among other things, a decline in fuel economy because of higher fuel density in colder temperatures, higher accident frequency, increased claims, and potentially higher equipment repair expenditures caused by harsh weather. ArcBest segment operations are influenced by seasonal fluctuations that impact customers’ supply chains and the resulting demand for expedited services. Expedite shipments of our ArcBest segment may decline due to post-holiday slowdowns during winter months and plant shutdowns during summer months. Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are influenced by seasonal variations in service event volume, which is generally lower during mild weather conditions. Business levels of the household goods moving services provided by our ArcBest segment are generally lower in the non-summer months when demand for moving services is typically lower. In addition to the impact of weather on seasonal business trends, severe weather events and natural disasters, such as harsh winter weather, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or third-party service providers, destroy our assets, affect regional economies, or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, each of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and business levels and, consequently, our operating results.  31 Table of ContentsWe are subject to certain risks arising from our international business. We provide transportation and logistics services to and from international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, changes in the economic strength of certain foreign countries; social, political, and economic instability; the ability to secure space or services from third-party aircraft, ocean vessels, and other modes of transportation or suppliers; burdens of complying with a wide variety of domestic and international laws and regulations, including export and import laws as well as different liability standards and less-developed legal systems; unexpected changes in foreign laws, regulations, trade, monetary or fiscal policy; changes in or enactment of tariffs, quotas, customs and other restrictions and trade barriers; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and changes in foreign exchange rates. Additional risks associated with our international business include restrictive trade policies and trade wars, new or increased trade tariffs imposed by the U.S. government, duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by foreign governments, and changes in international tax laws and regulations. In addition, natural disasters, pandemics, war, acts of terrorism, and insurrections could impede our ability to provide satisfactory services to customers in international locations. We are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and hold Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) status for businesses within our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments. Failure to comply with the FCPA and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in criminal and civil penalties against us. If we are unable to maintain our C-TPAT status, we may face a loss of certain business due to customer requirements to deal only with C-TPAT participating carriers, because of the enhanced levels of supply chain security provided by participating in the C-TPAT program. In addition, loss of C-TPAT status may result in significant border delays, which could cause our international operations to be less efficient and more costly than competitors also operating internationally.  We operate in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces, and we operate in Mexico by utilizing third-party carriers within the country. If the United States withdraws from or materially modifies the North American Free Trade Agreement, including by ratification of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or certain other international trade agreements or border policies, there could be more restrictive trade policies or increased regulatory complexities, which may result in increased costs and/or a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by our customers. Any such changes in trade policies and corresponding actions by other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures. As a result of actual or threatened terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented, continue to implement, and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. If security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so. Additional security measures may also reduce productivity of our drivers and third-party transportation service providers, which would increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance regarding the implementation of new antiterrorism measures and such new measures may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.    32 Table of Contents"
9,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2018-02-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS The nature of the business activities we conduct subjects us to certain hazards and risks. This Risk Factors
 section discusses some of the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry in general as well as risks specific to our Company that are largely out of our control. Other risks are described in “Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) and in Part II, Item 7A (Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are not the only risks we face. We may also be negatively impacted by a sustained interruption in our systems or operations, including, but not limited to, infrastructure damage, the loss of a key location such as a distribution center, or a significant disruption to the electric grid, or by a significant decline in demand for our services, each of which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; and/or other market disruptions. We could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline. We are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure, data breach, or other cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems, including communications, data processing, financial, and operating systems as well as proprietary software programs, that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. Cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that result in confidential data being compromised could have a significant impact on our operations. We utilize certain software applications provided by third parties, or provide underlying data which is utilized by third parties who provide certain outsourced administrative functions, either of which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Any problems caused by these third parties, including cyber attacks and security breaches at a vendor, could adversely affect our ability to provide service to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. A significant cyber incident, including denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our business interruption and cyber insurance would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe or certain cyber incidents; however, losses arising from a catastrophe or significant cyber incident would likely exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a significant cyber incident, including denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such event. We have experienced incidents involving attempted denial of service attacks, malware attacks, and other events intended to disrupt information systems, wrongfully obtain valuable information, or cause other types of malicious events that could have resulted in harm to our business. To date, the systems employed have been effective in identifying these types of events at a point when the impact on our business could be minimized. We must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, and other events that could have a security impact. Certain of our information technology needs are provided by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems depends upon the internet, global communications providers, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers; and our information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, or in other services provided to us by outside service providers upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  15 Table of Contentsand financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that supports our operations, and these operations depend on our ability to maintain these licenses. We have no guarantees that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We depend on our employees to support our business operations and future growth opportunities. If our relationship with our employees deteriorates, if we have difficulty attracting and retaining employees, or if our Asset-Based segment is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. As of December 2017, approximately 83% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT which extends through March 31, 2018. Contract negotiations for the period subsequent to March 31, 2018 began in January 2018 and are in progress. The negotiation of terms of the collective bargaining agreement is a very complex process. There can be no assurances that our future collective bargaining agreements will be renewed on terms favorable to us. Future collective bargaining agreements may result in higher labor costs, including increased benefit contribution rates to multiemployer health and welfare and pension plans and additional paid time off, or insufficient operational flexibility which may increase our operating costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may also result in a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages. We have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel for our Asset-Based operations, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels, and the available pool of drivers has been declining. Difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel or contractually required increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect our profitability and our ability to grow. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions that result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the Company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business. In addition to difficulties we may experience in driver retention, if we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs. Our ability to maintain and grow our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to retain and attract additional sales representatives and other key operational personnel and properly incentivize them to obtain new customers, maintain existing customer relationships, and efficiently manage our business. If we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and operational workforce, our ability to increase our revenues and operate our business could be negatively impacted.  The loss or reduction in business from one or more large customers, or an overall reduction in our customer base, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Although we do not have a significant customer concentration, the growth of our business could be materially impacted and our results of operations would be adversely affected if we lost all or a portion of the business of some of our large customers because they: chose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors; demanded pricing concessions for our services; required us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs; or developed their own shipping and distribution capabilities. Effective August 1, 2017, we began applying space-based minimum charges for LTL shipments to better reflect freight shipping trends that have evolved over the last several years. Space-based pricing involves the use of freight dimensions to determine applicable cubic minimum charges (“CMC”) that will supplement weight-based metrics when appropriate. Customer acceptance of the CMC pricing mechanism is difficult to ascertain at this point. Management cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, the changes in business levels and the impact on the total revenue per hundredweight measure due to the implementation of the CMC mechanism. Some customers may not be receptive to our space-based pricing initiatives, which could result in payment delays, uncollectible accounts receivable, or a loss of business. A reduction in  16 Table of Contentsour customer base or difficulty in collecting, or the inability to collect, payments from our customers due to changes in pricing or other competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Our initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful. Developing service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. Hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary labor inefficiencies. In addition, as we focus on growing the business in our ArcBest segment, we may encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments, which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors and in which we will encounter new competitive challenges, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels, as portions of salaries, wages, and benefits are fixed in nature and the adjustments which would otherwise be necessary to align the labor cost structure to corresponding business levels are limited as we strive to maintain customer service. We may not be able to appropriately adjust our cost structure to changing market demands. It is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs in periods of rapid or unexpected change. We may incur additional costs related to purchased transportation and/or labor inefficiencies experienced while, and for a time following, training employees who are hired to manage growth or are brought onboard from acquired companies. These costs of managing our cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We periodically evaluate and modify the network of our Asset-Based operations to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile the segment’s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that these network changes, to the extent such network changes are made, will result in a material improvement in our Asset-Based segment’s results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability, growth prospects, and ability to compete in the transportation industry. We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. We compete with LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. We also compete with domestic and global logistics service providers, including asset-light logistics companies, integrated logistics companies, and third-party freight brokers, which compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. These competitive factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  ·Some of our competitors have greater capital resources, a lower cost structure, or greater market share than we do or have other competitive advantages. The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size, including increased market share and stronger competitive position. Consolidations within the industry could also result in our competitors providing a more comprehensive set of services at competitive prices. These competitive pressures may cause a decrease in our freight volume or shipment levels or require us to lower the prices we charge for our services, which could adversely affect our results of operations, growth prospects and profitability. 17 Table of Contents ·Our Asset-Based segment competes primarily with nonunion motor carriers who generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling and driving personnel than union carriers, and  have greater operating flexibility because they are subject to less stringent labor work rules. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors allow for a lower cost structure than that of our Asset-Based segment. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact the operating results of our Asset-Based segment relative to our competitors in the LTL industry. ·Some of our competitors, such as railroads, are outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry and certain challenges specific to the motor carrier freight transportation industry, including the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; changes to driver hours-of-service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations, could result in the service offerings of these competitors being more competitive. ·Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels. ·Customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors. ·Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. ·Certain of our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete. ·The industry has experienced evolving freight shipping trends over the last several years, including overall growth and ongoing profile shift of bulkier shipments across the entire supply chain, the acceleration in e-commerce, and more unique requirements of many shipping and logistics solutions. An increasing percentage of freight is taking up more space in trailers without a corresponding increase in weight, which contributes to lower average weight per shipment. As the retail industry continues to undergo a shift away from the traditional brick and mortar model towards e-commerce, the manner in which our customers source or utilize our services will be impacted and our operating results could be adversely affected. ·Competition in the LTL industry from asset-light logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect customer relationships and prices in our Asset-Based operations. Conversely, the operations of our ArcBest segment may be adversely impacted if customers develop their own logistics operations, thus reducing demand for our services, or if shippers shift business to truckload brokerage companies or asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies’ trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight industry-wide capacity. Our FleetNet operations also face a competitive disadvantage from companies which insource their fleet repair and maintenance services. ·To keep pace with advances in technology and client demands, we must anticipate market trends and enhance our information technology systems and continue to develop innovative services and capabilities in order to remain competitive. Our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the costs of our increased investments in technology.  18 Table of ContentsOur business is cyclical in nature, and we are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case, primarily in the North American economy, as well as our customers’ inventory levels. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight in the market and related pricing. Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower, or we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, thus negatively impacting our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our cost structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend credit to certain of these customers which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.  Given the economic conditions of recent years, current economic uncertainties, and the potential impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the pricing environment and economic conditions, which are made for purposes of impairment tests related to operating assets and deferred tax assets, will prove to be accurate.  We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations. A disruption in the availability or a significant increase in the cost to obtain these supplies, resulting from the effect of adverse economic conditions or related financial constraints on our suppliers’ business levels or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. Our operations and the rates we obtain for our services may also be negatively impacted when economic conditions lead to a decrease in shipping demand and excess tractor and trailer capacity in the industry. We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) outstanding under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”). Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $130.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2018, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization program, new note payable or capital lease arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. (See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.)  19 Table of ContentsOur nonunion defined benefit pension plan trust holds investments in short-duration debt securities and cash equivalent, fixed income, and floating rate loan mutual funds. Declines in the value of plan assets resulting from instability in the financial markets, general economic downturn, or other economic factors beyond our control could diminish the funded status of the nonunion defined benefit pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plan, including an increase in our cash funding requirement prior to the final distribution of benefits to plan participants. A change in the interest rates used to calculate our funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “PPA”) may also impact contributions required to fund our plan. Significant plan contribution requirements could reduce the cash available for working capital and other business needs and opportunities. An increase in required pension plan contributions may adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity. Substantial future investment losses on pension plan assets would increase pension expense in the years following the losses. In addition, a change in the discount rate used to calculate our obligations for our nonunion defined benefit pension plan and postretirement health benefit plan for financial statement purposes would impact the accumulated benefit obligation and expense for these plans. An increase in expense for these pension and postretirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations.  We could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or political and/or civil unrest on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition.  Our nonunion defined benefit pension plan could have greater than anticipated funding requirements, which may adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an amendment was executed to terminate our nonunion defined benefit pension plan as of December 31, 2017, as further discussed in Note I to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Lump sum benefit distributions to participants and the purchase of an annuity contract to settle the pension obligation related to benefits for which participants elect to defer payment until a later date, are likely to occur primarily in the second half of 2018. Our requirement to fund the plan prior to the final distribution of benefits to plan participants, the amount of which will be determined by the plan’s actuary, is currently estimated to require a cash payment of approximately $10.0 million, although there can be no assurances in this regard, as the actual amount is dependent on various factors, including final benefit calculations, the benefit elections made by plan participants, interest rates, the value of plan assets, and the cost to purchase an annuity contract to settle the pension obligation related to benefits for which participants elect to defer payment until a later date.  We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships. A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate competitive contracts with railroads or other third-party service providers to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or obtain services at costs that are acceptable to us or our customers. If these situations occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships could be adversely impacted. Our ability to secure the services of third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control, including the inability to obtain the services of reliable third parties at competitive prices; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators for our Expedite operations and drivers of contracted carriers for our Truckload and Truckload-Dedicated operations; shortages in available cargo capacity; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in government regulations affecting the transportation industry and their related impact on operations, such as hours-of-service rules and the ELD mandate discussed in “Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our Asset-Light businesses.  20 Table of Contents Third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. These providers are subject to industry regulations which may have a significant impact on their operations, causing them to increase prices or exit the industry. Increased industry demand for these transportation services may reduce available capacity and such a reduction or other changes in these services offered by third parties may increase pricing or otherwise change the services we are able to offer to our customers. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, including the effect of third-party carrier rate increases outpacing customer pricing, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on the operations, revenues, and profitability of our Asset-Light businesses and our customer relationships.  In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with the operations of our ArcBest segment, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are owner operators, independent contractors, or employees working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in retaining them. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. Our engagement of independent contractor drivers to provide a portion of the capacity for our Expedite operations within our ArcBest segment exposes us to different risks than we face with our employee drivers. If we have difficulty in securing independent owner operators or if we experience operational or regulatory issues related to our use of these contract drivers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The driver fleet of the Expedite operations within our ArcBest segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in labor costs, our services may be less competitive, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as these independent owner operators and individuals are third-party service providers, rather than our employees, they may decline loads of freight from time to time, which may impede our ability to deliver freight in a timely manner. If we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our ArcBest segment. We pay independent contractor drivers a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause the fuel surcharge we pay to independent contractors to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs, which could adversely impact the results of operations of our ArcBest segment. Many states have initiated enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors, and class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations resulting in the reclassification of the owner operators of the Expedite operations within our ArcBest segment as employees. In the event of such reclassification of our owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. These liabilities and additional costs could include exposure, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest and under vicarious liability principles, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our ArcBest segment.  21 Table of ContentsOur business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, operations of ocean freight forwarders and ocean transportation intermediaries, safety, contract compliance, insurance and bonding requirements, tariff and trade policies, customs, import and export, food safety, employment practices, licensing and registration, taxation, environmental matters, data privacy and security, and financial reporting. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions, drivers’ hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics, or cargo security. Increases in costs to comply with such regulations or the failure to comply, which could subject us to penalties or revocation of our permits or licenses, could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services.  We operate in the United States pursuant to federal operating authority granted by the DOT. Our failures, or the failures of our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with DOT safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage. Our ArcBest segment utilizes third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements as previously mentioned. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on our ArcBest segment’s business and results of operations. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to abide by our policies and procedures, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to remedy, violations by them. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling and transportation of hazardous materials and similar matters. We may transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives, and we operate in industrial areas where service centers and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. At certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel in underground and aboveground tanks and/or we operate with non-discharge certifications or stormwater permits under the federal Clean Water Act. We may be subject to substantial fines or civil penalties if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required testing provisions. Our operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, a spill or accident involving hazardous substances, and hazardous waste disposal. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury. Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal, state, or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation. However, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions have also required vendors to introduce  22 Table of Contentsnew engines, and the maintenance demands and reliability of vehicles equipped with these newly designed engines, as well as the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, is uncertain. Such regulatory actions may also require changes in our operating practices and impair equipment productivity. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure, business, or results of operations. Furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services. We may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any recent or future acquisitions. As part of our long-term strategy to ensure we are positioned to serve our customers within the changing marketplace by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, we strategically invested in our ArcBest segment with the acquisitions of Logistics & Distribution Services, LLC, in 2016 and Smart Lines Transportation Group, LLC and Bear Transportation Services, L.P., in 2015. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks which may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Further, we may not be able to acquire any additional companies at all or on terms favorable to us, even though we may have incurred expenses in evaluating and pursuing the strategic transactions.  Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or earnings from the operation of an acquired business to offset our acquisition or investment costs. The degree of success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends, in part, upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses. The possible difficulties of integration include, among others:  ·retention of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers;  ·combining operations of the companies, including the integration of workforces at different locations while continuing to provide consistent, high-quality service to customers; ·unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information technology, communications, and other systems, including additional systems training and other labor inefficiencies;  ·consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures;  ·difficulties and costs of on-boarding employees to our policies, procedures, business culture, and benefits and compensation programs, which may be inconsistent with those of the acquired company;  ·difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency;  ·inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new markets or geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them;  ·the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;  ·increased tax liability or other tax risk if future earnings are less than anticipated or there is a change in the tax deductibility of certain items; and ·other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities, including previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions.  The risks involved in successful integration could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. The diversion of management’s attention from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support the acquisitions, could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated from the acquisitions, and within the anticipated timeframe, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future.  23 Table of ContentsWe may not achieve some or all of the expected financial and operating benefits of our corporate restructuring and the restructuring may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Effective January 1, 2017, our new corporate structure was implemented to unify our sales, pricing, customer service, marketing, and capacity sourcing functions, allowing us to operate as one logistics provider under the ArcBest® brand, as previously discussed in Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Implementation of the restructuring plan has been costly and disruptive to certain aspects of our business. We may incur additional, unexpected costs, and we may not be able to realize the long-term cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring. If we incur additional costs or fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans. ABF Freight System, Inc. and certain other subsidiaries reported in our Asset-Based operating segment (“ABF Freight”) contribute to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. ABF Freight’s contributions generally are based on the time worked by its contractual employees in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement with the IBT and other related supplemental agreements. The multiemployer plans to which ABF Freight contributes, which have been established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT) and cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan pursuant to an agreement in a relatively short period of time. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan.  The 25 multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight’s obligations to these plans are generally specified in the ABF NMFA, which was implemented on November 3, 2013 and will remain in effect through March 31, 2018. The funding obligations to the multiemployer pension plans are intended to satisfy the requirements imposed by PPA, which was permanently extended by the Reform Act under the CFCAA. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. However, we cannot determine with any certainty the contribution amounts that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements for ABF Freight’s contractual employees.  Several of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded. The underfunded status of these plans developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved, if it can be achieved at all. In addition, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The reduction or loss of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk or instability in the financial markets on plan assets and liabilities, and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, all of which are beyond our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities, and our future contribution requirements.  Based on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended December 31, 2016, approximately 60% of ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in “critical and declining status”, including the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the “Central States Pension Plan”). “Critical and declining status” is applicable to critical status plans under the PPA that are projected to become insolvent anytime in the current plan year or during the next 14 plan years, or if the plan is projected to become  24 Table of Contentsinsolvent within the next 19 plan years and either the plan’s ratio of inactive participants to active participants exceeds two to one or the plan’s funded percentage is less than 80%. Approximately 1% of ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in “critical status” (generally less than 65% funded) but not in “critical and declining status” and approximately 6% of its contributions are made to plans that are in “endangered status” (generally more than 65% but less than 80% funded), as defined by the PPA. Approximately one-half of ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension contributions are made to the Central States Pension Plan. The funded percentage of the Central States Pension Plan, as set forth in information provided by the Central States Pension Plan, was 37.8%, 42.1%, and 47.9% as of January 1, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In September 2015, the Central States Pension Plan filed an application with the Treasury Department seeking approval under the Reform Act for a pension rescue plan, which included benefit reductions for participants in the Central States Pension Plan in an attempt to avoid the insolvency of the plan that otherwise is projected by the plan to occur. In May 2016, the Treasury Department denied the Central States Pension Plan’s proposed rescue plan. The trustees of the Central States Pension Plan subsequently announced that a new rescue plan would not be submitted and stated that it is not possible to develop and implement a new rescue plan that complies with the final Reform Act regulations issued by the Treasury Department on April 26, 2016. Although the future of the Central States Pension Plan is impacted by a number of factors, without legislative action, the plan is currently projected to become insolvent within 10 years or less. ABF Freight’s current collective bargaining agreement with the IBT provides for contributions to the Central States Pension Plan through March 31, 2018, and it is ABF Freight’s understanding that its contribution rate is not expected to increase during the remainder of this period (though there are no guarantees). ABF Freight’s contribution rates are made in accordance with its collective bargaining agreements with the IBT and other related supplemental agreements. In consideration of high multiemployer plan contribution rates, several of the plans to which ABF Freight contributes, including the Central States Pension Plan, have frozen contribution rates at current levels under ABF Freight’s current collective bargaining agreement. Future contribution rates will be determined through the negotiation process for contract periods following the term of the current collective bargaining agreement. ABF Freight pays some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry and continues to address the effect of the segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results in discussions with the IBT. ABF Freight is currently negotiating with the IBT for a new collective bargaining agreement for the period subsequent to March 31, 2018, and cannot determine with any certainty the minimum contributions which will be required under future collective bargaining agreements or the impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to litigation risks that could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including class-action litigation and other legal proceedings brought by customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties, related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities, including damages, fines, penalties, and substantial legal and related costs, that may result from these claims and litigation. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost and ability to obtain insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team.  Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings.  We establish reserves based on our assessment of legal matters and contingencies. Subsequent developments related to legal claims asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  25 Table of ContentsOur management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of key employees or inability to execute our training and succession planning strategies could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business.  Our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program contain customary financial and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Our Credit Agreement, which governs our Credit Facility, contains representations and warranties, conditions, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Our accounts receivable securitization program also contains affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including a maximum adjusted leverage ratio and requirements to maintain certain characteristics of the receivables, such as rates of delinquency, default, and dilution. If we default under the terms of the Credit Agreement or our accounts receivable securitization program and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. In the event of a default under either of these facilities, we could automatically default on the other of these facilities and on our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or accounts receivable securitization program, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which our Credit Facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if the facilities are terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be acceptable. A default under the Credit Agreement or accounts receivable securitization program, changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements, or our inability to renew our financing arrangements with terms that are acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, failing to achieve certain financial ratios as required by our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms or properly forecast capital needs to correspond with business volumes. We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited; it may be necessary for us to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional financing or leasing arrangements, possibly on less favorable terms; or our revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased expenditures for maintenance. Forecasting business volumes involves many factors, including general economic trends and the impact of competition, which are subject to uncertainty and beyond our control. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, especially for revenue equipment, in relation to corresponding business levels, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity. In addition, our Credit Facility contains provisions that could limit our level of annual capital expenditures. If we were unable to properly forecast capital needs and/or were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, obtain adequate financing at acceptable terms, or if our capital spending was otherwise limited, there could be an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth.   26 Table of ContentsClaims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Claims may be asserted against us for accidents or for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize for our Asset-Light businesses, for our actions in retaining their services, or for loss or damage to our customers’ goods for which we are determined to be responsible. Such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We have established liabilities which are adjusted to reflect our claims experience; however, actual claims costs and legal expenses may exceed our estimates. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss and damage claims for the operations of our Asset-Based segment and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event. Our self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if we were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, it could materially increase our insurance costs or collateral requirements, or create difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums or deductibles in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, claims experience, current and future federal and state laws and regulations, and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. In particular, with the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), we are required to provide health care benefits to all full-time employees that meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria set forth in the PPACA. Many of these requirements have been phased in over time; the majority of the provisions that impact us the most became effective during 2015. The PPACA also requires individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties, so employees who are currently eligible but have elected not to participate in our health care plans may ultimately find it more advantageous to do so. In general, implementing the requirements of health care reform has imposed additional administrative costs. The costs of maintaining and monitoring compliance and reports and other effects of these new healthcare requirements, including any failure to comply, may significantly increase our health care coverage costs and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in healthcare legislation could potentially occur in the near term, which could result in changes to healthcare eligibility, design, and cost structure that could have an adverse impact on our business and operating costs; however, we cannot currently determine the impact of future regulatory action on our health care plans and the related costs. We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty liability. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements.   27 Table of ContentsWe depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters; armed conflicts; terrorist attacks; actions by producers, including a decrease in drilling activity or the use of crude oil and oil reserves for purposes other than fuel production; or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at our distribution centers and certain other service centers; however, we may experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules. Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil, political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters; and fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes which are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our Asset-Based segment and the Expedite and Truckload-Dedicated operations of our ArcBest segment assess a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. Although revenues from fuel surcharges generally offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs, we incur certain fuel costs that cannot be recovered with fuel surcharges, and other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of fuel costs through fuel surcharges, and the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. Whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating results may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. Throughout 2017, the fuel surcharge mechanism generally continued to have market acceptance among our customers; however, certain nonstandard pricing arrangements have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. The negative impact on operating margins of capped fuel surcharge revenue during periods of increasing fuel costs is more evident when fuel prices remain above the maximum levels recovered through the fuel surcharge mechanism on certain accounts. Also, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture in any particular period the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially in periods in which fuel prices rapidly increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, our fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to the corresponding decline in our fuel costs. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. Further, during periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose less compensatory fuel surcharge policies. Higher fuel prices cause customers of our FleetNet segment to seek cost savings throughout their businesses which may result in a reduction of miles driven and/or a deferral of maintenance practices that may reduce the volume of our maintenance service events, resulting in an adverse impact on the segment’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Part I, Item 1 (Business) of this Annual  28 Table of ContentsReport on Form 10-K. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations as well as fuel costs. A number of states have mandated, and California and certain other states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner operators of the Expedite operations of our ArcBest segment, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry which could lead to a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.   Reduced fuel demand due to improved fuel economy may result in legislative efforts to increase fuel taxes which, if enacted, could increase our costs. If we are not able to adequately increase our freight rates, recover fuel surcharges, or recognize fuel economy savings to offset increases in equipment and maintenance costs, and if we are not able to offset fuel tax increases through reductions in other excise taxes or through increases in the rates we charge our customers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. At times, market forces may create market situations in which demand outstrips supply. In those situations, we may face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers for our Asset-Based operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. During prolonged periods of decreased business levels, we and other trucking companies may make strategic fleet reductions, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. When the supply exceeds the demand for used revenue equipment, the general market value of used revenue equipment decreases. Used equipment prices are also subject to substantial fluctuations based on availability of financing and commodity prices for scrap metal. If market prices for used revenue equipment decline, corresponding decreases in our established salvage values on equipment being used in our Asset-Based operations would increase our depreciation expense, and we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2017, we had recorded goodwill of $108.3 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $73.5 million. Our goodwill and intangible assets resulted primarily from acquisitions in the ArcBest segment. Our annual impairment evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2017, 2016, and 2015 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances. However, significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of our reporting units could result in impairment and a resulting non-cash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our corporate reputation and our business depend on a variety of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, patents, and licenses and other contractual rights.  If we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation, our brands, and other intellectual property rights, or if we face claims of infringement of third-party rights, our business may suffer.  The costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our rights or to defend against infringement claims could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. ArcBest is recognized as a multi-faceted logistics provider with creative problem solvers who deliver integrated logistics solutions. Beyond this fundamental marketplace recognition of our collective brand identity, our other key brands represent additional unique value in their target markets. The ABF Freight brand is well-recognized in the industry for our Asset-Based operations’ leadership in commitment to quality, customer service, safety, and technology. The Panther Premium  29 Table of ContentsLogistics brand within the operations of our ArcBest segment is recognized for solving the toughest shipping and logistics challenges, delivering time-sensitive, mission-critical, and high-value freight with speed and precision. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of our brands. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party contract carriers and their drivers and owner operators or other third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers’ image of our brands, including ArcBest, ABF Freight, Panther Premium Logistics, and U‑Pack, and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, environmental concerns, and similar matters, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Our business and our image could also be negatively impacted by a breach of our corporate policies by employees or vendors. With the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.  We have registered or are pursuing registration of various marks and designs as trademarks in the United States, including but not limited to “ArcBest,” “ABF Freight,” “FleetNet America,” “Panther Premium Logistics,” “U-Pack,” and “The Skill & The Will.”  For some marks, we also have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service or trade names or logos or designs similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered trademarks. From time to time, we have acquired or attempted to acquire internet domain names held by others when such names have caused consumer confusion or had the potential to cause consumer confusion. Additionally, our business and operations utilize and depend upon both internally developed and purchased technology, either of which could be infringed upon, or subject to claims of infringement.  Any of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property, whether owned or licensed, could be challenged or invalidated, or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our efforts to obtain, enforce, or protect our proprietary rights, or to defend against a third-party infringement claim, may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations, adverse weather conditions, and natural disasters. Our operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels and, consequently, revenues and operating results. Freight shipments and operating costs of our Asset-Based and ArcBest operating segments can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The first quarter of each year generally has the lowest tonnage levels, although other factors, including the state of the U.S. and global economies, may influence quarterly freight tonnage levels. At the same time, first quarter operating expenses may increase due to, among other things, a decline in fuel economy because of higher fuel density in colder temperatures, higher accident frequency, increased claims, and potentially higher equipment repair expenditures caused by harsh weather. ArcBest segment operations are influenced by seasonal fluctuations that impact customers’ supply chains and the resulting demand for expedited services. Expedite shipments of our ArcBest segment may decline due to post-holiday slowdowns during winter months and plant shutdowns during summer months. Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are influenced by seasonal variations, and service event volume is generally lower during mild weather conditions. Business levels of the household goods moving services provided by our ArcBest segment are generally lower in the non-summer months when demand for moving services is typically lower. In addition to the impact of weather on seasonal business trends, severe weather events and natural disasters, such as harsh winter weather, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers, destroy our assets, affect regional economies, or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, each of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and business levels and, consequently, our operating results.  30 Table of ContentsWe are subject to certain risks arising from our international business. We provide transportation and logistics services to and from international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, changes in the economic strength of certain foreign countries; social, political, and economic instability; the ability to secure space or services from third-party aircraft, ocean vessels, and other modes of transportation or suppliers; burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States regulations, including export and import laws as well as different liability standards and less developed legal systems; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and changes in foreign exchange rates. Additional risks associated with our international business include restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by foreign governments, and changes in international tax laws and regulations. In addition, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, and insurrections could impede our ability to provide satisfactory services to customers in international locations. We are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and hold Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) status for businesses within our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments. Failure to comply with the FCPA and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in criminal and civil penalties against us. If we are unable to maintain our C-TPAT status, we may face a loss of certain business due to customer requirements to deal only with C-TPAT participating carriers, because of the enhanced levels of supply chain security provided by participating in the C-TPAT program. In addition, loss of C-TPAT status may result in significant border delays, which could cause our international operations to be less efficient than competitors also operating internationally.  We operate in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces, and we operate in Mexico by utilizing third-party carriers within the country. If the United States withdraws from or materially modifies the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) or certain other international trade agreements or border policies, there could be more restrictive trade policies or increased regulatory complexities, which may result in increased costs and/or a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by our customers. Any such changes in trade policies and corresponding actions by other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures. As a result of actual or threatened terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented, continue to implement, and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. If security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so. Additional security measures may also reduce productivity of our drivers and third-party transportation service providers, which would increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance regarding the implementation of new antiterrorism measures and such new measures may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.   31 Table of Contents"
13,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2017-02-28,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS The nature of the business activities we conduct subjects us to certain hazards and risks. This Risk Factors
 section discusses some of the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry in general as well as risks specific to our Company that are largely out of our control. Other risks are described in “Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors” within Business included in Part I, Item 1 and in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are not the only risks we face. We may also be negatively impacted by a sustained interruption in our systems or operations, including, but not limited to, infrastructure damage, the loss of a key location such as a distribution center, or a significant disruption to the electric grid, or by a significant decline in demand for our services, each of which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; and/or other market disruptions. We could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline. We are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure, data breach, or other cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems, including communications and data processing systems, and proprietary software programs, that are integral to the efficient operation of our business. Cybersecurity attacks and other cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that result in confidential data being compromised could have a significant impact on our operations. We utilize certain software applications provided by third parties, or provide underlying data which is utilized by third parties who provide certain outsourced administrative functions, either of which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. A significant cyber incident, including denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Certain of our information technology needs are provided by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems depends upon the Internet, global communications providers, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers; and our information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, or in other services provided to us by outside service providers upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that supports our operations, and thus these operations depend on our ability to maintain these licenses. We have no guarantees that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We may not achieve some or all of the expected financial and operating benefits of our corporate restructuring and the restructuring may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. On November 3, 2016, we announced our plan to implement a new corporate structure to unify our sales, pricing, customer service, marketing, and capacity sourcing functions effective January 1, 2017, and to allow us to operate as one logistics provider under the ArcBestSM brand, as previously discussed in “Business” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of this plan, we eliminated approximately 130 positions and recorded $10.3 million of restructuring charges in operating expenses during the fourth quarter of 2016, the majority of which are non-cash, for impairment of software, contract and lease terminations, severance, and relocation expenses (see Note O to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). We estimate we will incur additional charges of approximately $2.0 million in 2017 related to the restructuring. 15 Table of Contents The calculation of anticipated charges, as well as cost savings and other benefits, resulting from our corporate restructuring are based on estimates and assumptions which are subject to uncertainties. Implementation of the restructuring plan is costly and disruptive to certain aspects of our business. We may incur additional, unexpected costs or our estimates and assumptions may otherwise prove to be inaccurate, and we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring. Restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees’ time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business, and we may experience inefficiencies during transitional periods of our restructuring. If we incur additional costs or fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.  We depend on our employees to support our business operations and future growth opportunities. If our relationship with our employees deteriorates, if we have difficulty attracting and retaining employees, or if our Asset-Based segment is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. As of December 2016, approximately 77% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT which extends through March 31, 2018. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may result in a work stoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages. We have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel for our Asset-Based operations, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels, and the available pool of drivers has been declining. Difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel or contractually required increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect our profitability and our ability to grow. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions that result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business. In addition to difficulties we may experience in driver retention, if we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs. Our ability to maintain and grow our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to retain and attract additional sales representatives and other key operational personnel and properly incentivize them to obtain new customers, maintain existing customer relationships, and efficiently manage our business. If we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and operational workforce, our ability to increase our revenues and operate our business could be negatively impacted. We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete in the transportation industry. We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. Our Asset-Based segment competes with many other LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. Our ArcBest segment competes with domestic and global logistics service providers which compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing customers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. These competitive factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  16 Table of Contents ·Some of our competitors have greater capital resources, a lower cost structure, or greater market share than we do or have other competitive advantages. The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger LTL carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size. Our Asset-Based segment could experience some competitive difficulties if the remaining LTL carriers, in fact, realize advantages because of their size. Industry consolidations could also result in our competitors providing a more comprehensive set of services at competitive prices. ·Our Asset-Based segment competes primarily with nonunion motor carriers who generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling and driving personnel than union carriers, and  have greater operating flexibility because they are subject to less stringent labor work rules. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors allow for a lower cost structure than that of our Asset-Based segment. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact the operating results of our Asset-Based segment relative to our competitors in the LTL industry. ·Some of our competitors, such as railroads, are outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry and certain challenges specific to the motor carrier freight transportation industry, including the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; changes to driver hours-of-service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations, could result in the service offerings of these competitors being more competitive. ·Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels. ·Customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors. ·Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. ·Certain of our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete. ·Competition in the LTL industry from asset-light logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect customer relationships and prices in our Asset-Based operations. Conversely, the operations of our ArcBest segment may be adversely impacted if customers develop their own logistics operations, thus reducing demand for our services, or if shippers shift business to truckload brokerage companies or asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies’ trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight industry-wide capacity. Our FleetNet operations also face a competitive disadvantage from companies which insource their fleet repair and maintenance services. ·To keep pace with advances in technology and client demands, we must anticipate market trends and enhance our information technology systems and continue to develop innovative services and capabilities in order to remain competitive. Our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the costs of our increased investments in technology. We could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans. ABF Freight System, Inc. and certain other subsidiaries reported in our Asset-Based operating segment (“ABF Freight”) contribute to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. ABF Freight’s contributions generally are based on the time worked by its contractual employees in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement with the IBT and other related supplemental agreements. The multiemployer plans to which ABF Freight contributes, which have been established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT) and cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan,  17 Table of Contentsit owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. Withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan pursuant to an agreement in a relatively short period of time. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, we would have material liabilities for our share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan.  The 25 multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight’s obligations to these plans are specified in the ABF NMFA, which was implemented on November 3, 2013 and will remain in effect through March 31, 2018. The funding obligations to the multiemployer pension plans are intended to satisfy the requirements imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “PPA”), which was permanently extended by the Reform Act under the CFCAA. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. However, we cannot determine with any certainty the contribution amounts that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements for ABF Freight’s contractual employees.  Several of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded. The underfunded status of these plans developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved if it can be achieved at all. In addition, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The reduction or loss of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk on plan assets and liabilities, and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, all of which are outside our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities, and our future contribution requirements.  Based on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended December 31, 2015, approximately 60% of ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in “critical and declining status”, including the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the “Central States Pension Plan”). Critical and declining status is applicable to critical status plans under the PPA that are projected to become insolvent anytime in the current plan year or during the next 14 plan years, or if the plan is projected to become insolvent within the next 19 plan years and either the plan’s ratio of inactive participants to active participants exceeds two to one or the plan’s funded percentage is less than 80%. Approximately 4% of ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in “critical status” (generally less than 65% funded) but not in “critical and declining status” and approximately 3% of its contributions are made to plans that are in “endangered status” (generally more than 65% but less than 80% funded), as defined by the PPA. Approximately one-half of our ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension contributions are made to the Central States Pension Plan. The funded percentage of the Central States Pension Plan, as set forth in information provided by the Central States Pension Plan, was 42.1%, 47.9%, and 48.4% as of January 1, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. In September 2015, the Central States Pension Plan filed an application with the Treasury Department seeking approval under the Reform Act for a pension rescue plan, which included benefit reductions for participants in the Central States Pension Plan in an attempt to avoid the insolvency of the plan that otherwise is projected by the plan to occur. In May 2016, the Treasury Department denied the Central States Pension Plan’s proposed rescue plan. The trustees of the Central States Pension Plan subsequently announced that a new rescue plan would not be submitted and stated that it is not possible to develop and implement a new rescue plan that complies with the final Reform Act regulations issued by the Treasury Department on April 26, 2016. Although the future of the Central States Pension Plan is impacted by a number of factors, without legislative action, the plan is currently projected to become insolvent within 10 years or less. ABF Freight’s current collective bargaining agreement with the IBT provides for contributions to the Central States Pension Plan through March 31, 2018, and it is ABF Freight’s understanding that its contribution rate is not expected to increase during this period (though there are no guarantees). ABF Freight’s contribution rates are made in accordance with its collective bargaining agreements with the IBT and other related supplemental agreements. In consideration of high multiemployer plan contribution rates, several of the plans in addition to Central States Pension Plan have frozen contribution rates at current levels under ABF Freight’s current collective bargaining agreement. Future contribution rates will be determined through the negotiation process for contract periods following the term of the current collective bargaining agreement. ABF Freight pays some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry and continues to address the effect of the segment’s wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results in discussions with the IBT.   18 Table of ContentsWe may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any recent or future acquisitions. As part of our long-term strategy to ensure we are positioned to serve our customers within the changing marketplace by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, we have strategically invested in our ArcBest segment with the acquisitions of Logistics & Distribution Services, LLC during 2016 and Smart Lines Transportation Group, LLC and Bear Transportation Services, L.P. during 2015. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks which may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Further, we may not be able to acquire any additional companies at all or on terms favorable to us, even though we may have incurred expenses in evaluating and pursuing the strategic transactions.  Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue or earnings from the operation of an acquired business to offset our acquisition or investment costs. The degree of success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends, in part, upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses. The possible difficulties of integration include, among others:  ·retention of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers;  ·unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information, communications, and other systems, including additional systems training and other labor inefficiencies;  ·consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures;  ·difficulties and costs of on-boarding employees to our policies, procedures, business culture, and benefits and compensation programs, which may be inconsistent with those of the acquired company;  ·difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency;  ·inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new markets or geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them;  ·the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;  ·increased tax liability or other tax risk if future earnings are less than anticipated or there is a change in the tax deductibility of certain items; and ·other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities, including previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions.  The risks involved in successful integration could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. The diversion of management’s attention from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support the acquisitions, could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated from the acquisitions, and within the anticipated timeframe, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future. Our business is cyclical in nature, and we are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case, primarily in the North American economy, as well as our customers’ inventory levels and available tractor and trailer capacity in the trucking industry. We are also subject to risks related to disruption of world markets that could affect shipments between countries and could adversely affect the volume of freight in the market and related pricing. Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. In certain market conditions, we may have to accept more freight from freight brokers, where freight rates are typically lower,  19 Table of Contentsor we may be forced to incur more non-revenue miles to obtain loads. Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, thus negatively impacting our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions or facing credit issues could experience cash flow difficulties and, thus, represent a greater potential for payment delays or uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. Our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend credit to certain of these customers which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.  Given the economic conditions of recent years, current economic uncertainties, and the potential impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the pricing environment and economic conditions, which are made for purposes of impairment tests related to operating assets and deferred tax assets, will prove to be accurate.  We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations. A disruption in the availability or a significant increase in the cost to obtain these supplies, resulting from the effect of adverse economic conditions or related financial constraints on our suppliers’ business levels or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $70.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2017, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization program, new note payable or capital lease arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. (See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.) Our qualified nonunion defined benefit pension plan trust holds investments in equity and debt securities. Declines in the value of plan assets resulting from instability in the financial markets, general economic downturn, or other economic factors beyond our control could further diminish the funded status of the nonunion defined benefit pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plan. A change in the interest rates used to calculate our funding requirements under the PPA may impact contributions required to fund our plan. Significant plan contribution requirements could reduce the cash available for working capital and other business needs and opportunities. An increase in required pension plan contributions may adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity. Substantial future investment losses on pension plan assets would increase pension expense in the years following the losses. In addition, a change in the discount rate used to calculate our obligations for our nonunion defined benefit pension plan and postretirement health benefit plan for financial statement purposes would impact the accumulated benefit obligation and expense for these plans. An increase in expense for these pension and postretirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations. We could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or political and/or civil unrest on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition.  20 Table of ContentsOur business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, operations of ocean freight forwarders and ocean transportation intermediaries, safety, contract compliance, insurance and bonding requirements, tariff and trade policies, customs, import and export, employment practices, licensing and registration, taxation, environmental matters, data privacy and security, and financial reporting. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions, drivers’ hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics, or cargo security. Increases in costs to comply with such regulations or the failure to comply, which could subject us to penalties or revocation of our permits or licenses, could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services. Our failures, or the failures of our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with DOT safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage. ABF Freight System, Inc. also holds a federal Hazardous Materials Safety Permit (“HMSP”) issued by the FMCSA for our Asset-Based segment’s transportation of certain types and amounts of hazardous materials. In February 2017, ABF Freight System, Inc. was notified that the FMCSA would be conducting a compliance review of its records and safety management practices. In the event our Asset-Based segment loses the ability to operate with a HMSP due to revocation or suspension of the permit, either following the compliance review or at some time in the future, the segment could experience a loss of business which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our ArcBest segment utilizes third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements as previously mentioned. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on our ArcBest segment’s business and results of operations. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to abide by our policies and procedures, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to remedy, violations by them. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials and similar matters. We may transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives, and we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. At certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel in underground and aboveground tanks and/or we operate with non-discharge certifications or stormwater permits under the federal Clean Water Act. We may be subject to substantial fines or civil penalties if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required testing provisions. Our operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury.  21 Table of ContentsConcern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form of federal, state, or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation. However, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions have also required vendors to introduce new engines, and the maintenance demands and reliability of vehicles equipped with these newly designed engines, as well as the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, is uncertain. Such regulatory actions may also require changes in our operating practices and impair equipment productivity. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure, business, or results of operations. Furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services. The loss or reduction in business from one or more large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Although we do not have a significant customer concentration, the growth of our business could be materially impacted and our results of operations would be adversely affected if we lost all or a portion of the business of some of our large customers because they: chose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors; demanded pricing concessions for our services; required us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs; or developed their own shipping and distribution capabilities.  We are subject to litigation risks that could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation, including class-action litigation and other legal proceedings brought by customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties, related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities, including damages, fines, penalties, and substantial legal and related costs, that may result from these claims and litigation. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost and ability to obtain insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team.  Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings.  We establish reserves based on our assessment of legal matters and contingencies. Subsequent developments related to legal claims asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful. Developing service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. Hiring new employees may increase training costs and may result in temporary labor inefficiencies. In addition, as we focus on growing the businesses in our ArcBest  22 Table of Contentssegment, we may encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors and in which we will encounter new competitive challenges, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels, as portions of salaries, wages, and benefits are fixed in nature and the adjustments which would otherwise be necessary to align the labor cost structure to corresponding business levels are limited as we strive to maintain customer service. We may not be able to appropriately adjust our cost structure to changing market demands, and we may incur additional costs related to purchased transportation and/or labor inefficiencies experienced while, and for a time following, training employees who were hired to manage growth or were brought onboard from companies we have acquired. These costs of managing our cost structure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We periodically evaluate and modify the network of our Asset-Based operations to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile the segment’s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that these network changes, to the extent such network changes are made, will result in a material improvement in our Asset-Based segment’s results of operations.  Our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of key employees or inability to execute our succession planning strategies could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business.  We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships. A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or reduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate competitive contracts with railroads or other third-party service providers to expand our capacity, add additional routes, or obtain services at costs which are acceptable to us or our customers. If these situations occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and customer relationships could be adversely impacted. Our ability to secure the services of such third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control. The inability to obtain the services of reliable third parties at competitive prices; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators for our Expedite operations and drivers of contracted truckload carriers for our brokerage operations; shortages in available cargo capacity; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in regulations impacting transportation; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our Asset-Light businesses.  Third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. These providers are subject to industry regulations which may have a significant impact on their operations, causing them to increase prices or exit the industry. Increased industry demand for these transportation services may reduce available capacity and such a reduction or other changes in these services offered by third parties may increase pricing or otherwise change the services we are able to offer to our customers. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on the operations, revenues, and profitability of our Asset-Light businesses and our customer relationships.  23 Table of ContentsIn addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with the operations of our ArcBest segment, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are employees, owner operators, or independent contractors working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in retaining them. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. Our engagement of independent contractor drivers to provide a portion of the capacity for our Expedite operations within our ArcBest segment exposes us to different risks than we face with our employee drivers. If we have difficulty in securing independent owner-operators or if we experience operational or regulatory issues related to our use of these contract drivers, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. The driver fleet of the Expedite operations within our ArcBest segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in labor costs, our services may be less competitive which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, as these independent owner operators and individuals are third-party service providers, rather than our employees, they may decline loads of freight from time to time which may impede our ability to deliver freight in a timely manner. If we fail to meet certain customer needs or incur increased expenses to do so, this could adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of our ArcBest segment. We pay independent contractor drivers a fuel surcharge that increases with the increase in fuel prices. A significant increase or rapid fluctuation in fuel prices could cause the fuel surcharge we pay to independent contractors to be higher than the revenue we receive under our customer fuel surcharge programs, which could adversely impact the results of operations of our ArcBest segment. Many states have initiated enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors, and class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations resulting in the reclassification of the owner operators of the Expedite operations within our ArcBest segment as employees. In the event of such reclassification of our owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. These liabilities and additional costs could include exposure, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our ArcBest segment. Our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program contain customary financial and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which governs our Credit Facility, contains representations and warranties, conditions, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Our accounts receivable securitization program also contains affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including a maximum adjusted leverage ratio and requirements to maintain certain characteristics of the receivables, such as rates of delinquency, default, and dilution. 24 Table of Contents If we default under the terms of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our accounts receivable securitization program and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. In the event of a default under either of these facilities, we could automatically default on the other of these facilities and on our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or accounts receivable securitization program, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which our Credit Facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if the facilities are terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be acceptable. A default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or accounts receivable securitization program, changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements, or our inability to renew our financing arrangements with terms that are acceptable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, failing to achieve certain financial ratios as required by our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms or properly forecast capital needs to correspond with business volumes. We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited; it may be necessary for us to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional financing or leasing arrangements, possibly on less favorable terms; or our revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased expenditures for maintenance. Forecasting business volumes involves many factors, including general economic trends and the impact of competition, which are subject to uncertainty and beyond our control. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, especially for revenue equipment, in relation to corresponding business levels, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity. In addition, our Credit Facility contains provisions that could limit our level of annual capital expenditures. If we were unable to properly forecast capital needs and/or were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, obtain adequate financing at acceptable terms, or if our capital spending was otherwise limited, there could be an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth.  Claims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Claims may be asserted against us for accidents or for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize for our Asset-Light businesses, for our actions in retaining their services, or for loss or damage to our customers’ goods for which we are determined to be responsible. Such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We have established liabilities which are adjusted to reflect our claims experience; however, actual claims costs and legal expenses may exceed our estimates. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. We are primarily self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss and damage claims for the operations of our Asset-Based segment and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event. Our self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if we were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, it could materially increase our insurance costs or collateral requirements, or create difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self- 25 Table of Contentsinsured retention limits. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums or deductibles in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, claims experience, current and future federal and state laws and regulations, and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. In particular, with the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), we are required to provide health care benefits to all full-time employees that meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria set forth in the PPACA. Many of these requirements have been phased in over time, with the majority of the most impactful provisions affecting us having begun in the second quarter of 2015. The PPACA also requires individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties, so employees who are currently eligible but have elected not to participate in our health care plans may ultimately find it more advantageous to do so. In general, implementing the requirements of health care reform has imposed additional administrative costs. The costs of maintaining and monitoring compliance and reports and other effects of these new healthcare requirements, including any failure to comply, may significantly increase our health care coverage costs and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further regulatory action relating to the PPACA is expected as a result of the outcome of the recent U.S. presidential election, which could result in changes to healthcare eligibility, design, and cost structure that could have an adverse impact on our business and operating costs. We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements. We depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters, armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, actions by producers, or other political, economic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at our distribution centers and certain other terminals; however, we may experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules. Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as global supply and demand for crude oil, political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters, and fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes which are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our Asset-Based segment and the Expedite operations of our ArcBest segment charge a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. Although revenues from fuel surcharges generally offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs, we incur certain fuel costs that cannot be recovered with fuel surcharges, and other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of fuel costs through fuel surcharges, and the effect of fuel surcharges on our  26 Table of Contentsoverall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. Whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating results may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. Throughout 2016, the fuel surcharge mechanism generally continued to have market acceptance among our customers; however, certain nonstandard pricing arrangements have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. The negative impact on operating margins of capped fuel surcharge revenue during periods of increasing fuel costs is more evident when fuel prices remain above the maximum levels recovered through the fuel surcharge mechanism on certain accounts. Also, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture in any particular period the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially in periods in which fuel prices rapidly increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, our fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to our fuel costs. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. Further, during periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose less compensatory fuel surcharge policies. Higher fuel prices cause customers of our FleetNet segment to seek cost savings throughout their businesses which may result in a reduction of miles driven and/or a deferral of maintenance practices that may reduce the volume of our maintenance service events, resulting in an adverse impact on the segment’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Business included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations as well as fuel costs. A number of states have mandated, and California and certain other states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment and fuel costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including owner operators of the Expedite operations of our ArcBest segment, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment and fuel prices which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry which could lead to a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we are unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.   Reduced fuel demand due to improved fuel economy may result in legislative efforts to increase fuel taxes which, if enacted, could significantly increase our costs. If we are not able to adequately increase our freight rates, recover fuel surcharges, or recognize fuel economy savings to offset increases in equipment and maintenance costs, and if we are not able to offset fuel tax increases through reductions in other excise taxes or through increases in the rates we charge our customers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. At times, market forces may create market situations in which demand outstrips supply. In those situations, we may face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers for our Asset-Based operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  27 Table of ContentsDuring prolonged periods of decreased business levels, we and other trucking companies may make strategic fleet reductions, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. When the supply exceeds the demand for used revenue equipment, the general market value of used revenue equipment decreases. Used equipment prices are also subject to substantial fluctuations based on availability of financing and commodity prices for scrap metal. If market prices for used revenue equipment decline, corresponding decreases in our established salvage values on equipment being used in our Asset-Based operations would increase our depreciation expense, and we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2016, we had recorded goodwill of $108.9 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $80.5 million. Our goodwill and intangible assets resulted primarily from acquisitions in the ArcBest segment. The Expedite, Truckload, and Moving service lines within our ArcBest segment have significant goodwill and are each evaluated as a separate reporting unit for the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets. Our annual impairment evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2016, 2015, and 2014 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances. However, significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of our reporting units could result in impairment and a resulting non-cash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our corporate reputation and our business depend on a variety of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, patents, and licenses and other contractual rights.    If we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation, our brands, and other intellectual property rights, or if we face claims of infringement of third-party rights, our business may suffer.  The costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our rights or to defend against infringement claims could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. ArcBest is recognized as a multi-faceted logistics provider with creative problem solvers who deliver integrated logistics solutions. Beyond this fundamental marketplace recognition of our collective brand identity, our other key brands represent additional unique value in their target markets. The ABF Freight brand is well-recognized in the industry for our Asset-Based operations’ leadership in its commitment to quality, customer service, safety, and technology. The Panther Premium Logistics brand within the operations of our ArcBest segment is synonymous with premium service. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of our brands. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party contract carriers and their drivers and owner operators or other third-party service providers, could adversely impact our customers’ image of our brands, including ArcBest, ABF Freight, Panther Premium Logistics, and U‑Pack and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, environmental concerns, and similar matters, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships. Our business and our image could also be negatively impacted by a breach of our corporate policies by employees or vendors. With the increased use of social media outlets, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands.  We have registered or are pursuing registration of various marks or designs as trademarks in the United States, including but not limited to “ArcBest,” “ABF Freight,” “FleetNet America,” “Panther Premium Logistics,” “U-Pack,” and “The Skill & The Will.”  For some marks, we also have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service or trade names or logos or designs similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered trademarks. From time to time, we have acquired or attempted to acquire Internet domain names held by others when such names have caused consumer confusion or had the potential to cause consumer confusion. Additionally, our business and operations utilize and depend upon both internally developed and purchased technology, either of which could be infringed upon, or subject to claims of infringement.  Any of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, patents, or other intellectual property, whether owned or licensed, could be  28 Table of Contentschallenged or invalidated, or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our efforts to obtain, enforce, or protect our proprietary rights, or to defend against a third-party infringement claim, may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations or adverse weather conditions. Our operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels and, consequently, revenues and operating results. Freight shipments and operating costs of our Asset-Based and ArcBest operating segments can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The first quarter of each year generally has the lowest tonnage levels; at the same time, operating expenses may increase due to, among other things, a decline in fuel economy because of higher fuel density in colder temperatures, higher accident frequency, increased claims, and potentially higher equipment repair expenditures caused by harsh weather. Expedite shipments of our ArcBest segment may decline due to post-holiday slowdowns during winter months and plant shutdowns during summer months. Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are influenced by seasonal variations, and service event volume is generally lower during mild weather conditions. Business levels of the moving services provided by our ArcBest segment are generally lower in the non-summer months when demand for moving services is typically lower. In addition to the impact of weather on seasonal business trends, severe weather events and natural disasters, such as harsh winter weather, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, each of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and business levels and, consequently, our operating results. We are subject to certain risks arising from our international business. We provide transportation and logistics services to and from international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, changes in the economic strength of certain foreign countries; social, political, and economic instability; the ability to secure space on third-party aircraft, ocean vessels, and other modes of transportation; burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States regulations, including export and import laws as well as different liability standards and less developed legal systems; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; and changes in foreign exchange rates. Additional risks associated with our international business include restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by foreign governments, and changes in international tax laws and regulations. In addition, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, and insurrections could impede our ability to provide satisfactory services to customers in international locations. We are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and hold Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT’) status for businesses within our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments. Failure to comply with the FCPA and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in criminal and civil penalties against us. If we are unable to maintain our C-TPAT status, we may face a loss of certain business due to customer requirements to deal only with C-TPAT participating carriers, because of the enhanced levels of supply chain security provided by participating in the C-TPAT program. In addition, loss of C‑TPAT status may result in significant border delays, which could cause our international operations to be less efficient than competitors also operating internationally.  Our business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures. As a result of actual or threatened terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. If security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so. Additional security measures may also reduce productivity of our drivers and third-party transportation service providers, which would increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such new measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.  29 Table of Contents "
18,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2016-02-26,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS The nature of the business activities we conduct subjects us to certain hazards and risks. This Risk Factors
 section discusses some of the material risks relating to our business activities, including business risks affecting the transportation industry in general as well as risks specific to our company that are largely out of our control. Other risks are described in “Item 1. Business – Freight Transportation (ABF Freight) Segment – Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” These risks are not the only risks we face. We may also be negatively impacted by a sustained interruption in our systems or operations, including, but not limited to, infrastructure damage, the loss of a key location such as a distribution center, or a significant disruption to the electric grid, or by a significant decline in demand for our services, each of which may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; and/or other market disruptions. Our business could also be affected by additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial. If any of these risks or circumstances actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations and impair our ability to implement business plans or complete development activities as scheduled. In that case, the market price of our common stock could decline. We are dependent on our information technology systems, and a systems failure, data breach, or other cybersecurity incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information technology systems in operating our business. Our information technology systems are critical to understanding customer demands, accepting and planning loads, dispatching equipment and drivers, and billing and collecting for our services as well as producing accurate and timely financial statements and analyzing information to help us manage our business efficiently and effectively. Cybersecurity attacks and cyber incidents that impact the availability, reliability, speed, accuracy, or other proper functioning of these systems or that result in confidential data being compromised could have a significant impact on our operations. We utilize certain software applications provided by third parties, or provide underlying data which is utilized by third parties to provide certain outsourced administrative functions, either of which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. A significant cyber incident, including denial of service, system failure, security breach, intentional or inadvertent acts by employees, disruption by malware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers, cause errors or delays in financial reporting, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Certain of our information technology needs are provided by third parties, and we have limited control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of services provided by our vendors or whether they will continue to provide services that are essential to our business. The efficient and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems depends upon the Internet, global communications providers, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, electric utility providers, and telecommunications providers; and our information technology systems are vulnerable to interruption by adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Disruptions or failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, or in other services provided to us by outside service providers upon which we rely to operate our business and report financial results, may adversely affect our operations and the services we provide, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we license a variety of software that supports our operations, and thus these operations depend on our ability to maintain these licenses. We have no guarantees that we will be able to continue these licensing arrangements with the current licensors, or that we can replace the functions provided by these licenses, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. We could be obligated to make additional significant contributions to multiemployer pension plans. ABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans to provide benefits for its contractual employees. ABF Freight’s contributions generally are based on the time worked by its contractual employees in accordance with its collective bargaining agreement with the IBT and other related supplemental agreements. The multiemployer plans to which ABF Freight contributes, which have been established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, are jointly-trusteed (half of the trustees of each plan are selected by the participating employers, the other half by the IBT)  15 Table of Contentsand cover collectively-bargained employees of multiple unrelated employers. Due to the inherent nature of multiemployer pension plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets received by the plans are not segregated by employer, and contributions made by one employer can be and are used to provide benefits to current and former employees of other employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If a participating employer in a multiemployer pension plan completely withdraws from the plan, it owes to the plan its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits, referred to as a withdrawal liability. A complete withdrawal generally occurs when the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan. A withdrawal liability is also owed in the event the employer withdraws from a plan in connection with a mass withdrawal, which generally occurs when all or substantially all employers withdraw from the plan pursuant to an agreement in a relatively short period of time. Were ABF Freight to completely withdraw from certain multiemployer pension plans, whether in connection with a mass withdrawal or otherwise, under current law, it would have material liabilities for its share of the unfunded vested liabilities of each such plan.  The 25 multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes vary greatly in size and in funded status. ABF Freight’s contribution obligations to these plans are specified in the ABF NMFA, which was implemented on November 3, 2013 and extends through March 31, 2018. The funding obligations to the multiemployer pension plans are intended to satisfy the requirements imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “PPA”), which was permanently extended by the Reform Act under the CFCAA. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s contribution obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. However, we cannot determine with any certainty the contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements for our contractual employees.  Several of the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes are underfunded and, in some cases, significantly underfunded. The underfunded status of these plans developed over many years, and we believe that an improved funded status will also take time to be achieved. In addition, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact the viability of contributing employers. The reduction or loss of contributions by member employers, the impact of market risk on plan assets and liabilities, and the effect of any one or combination of the aforementioned business risks, which are outside our control, have the potential to adversely affect the funded status of the multiemployer pension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities, and our future contribution requirements.  Based on the most recent annual funding notices we have received, most of which are for plan years ended December 31, 2014, approximately 64% of ABF Freight’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans are made to plans that are in “critical status” (generally less than 65% funded), including the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension Plan (the “Central States Pension Plan”), and approximately 3% of our contributions are made to plans that are in “endangered status” (generally more than 65% but less than 80% funded), as defined by the PPA. Approximately one-half of ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension contributions are made to the Central States Pension Plan. The funded percentage of the Central States Pension Plan, as set forth in information provided by the Central States Pension Plan, was 47.9%, 48.4%, and 47.6% as of January 1, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In 2005, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) granted an extension of the period of time over which the Central States Pension Plan amortizes unfunded liabilities by ten years, subject to the condition that a targeted funding ratio is maintained by the plan. Based on information currently available to us, the Central States Pension Plan has not received notice of revocation of the ten-year amortization extension granted by the IRS. In the unlikely event that the IRS were to revoke the extension, the revocation would apply retroactively to the 2004 plan year, which would result in a material liability for ABF Freight’s share of the resulting funded deficiency, the extent of which is currently unknown to us.  We operate in a highly competitive industry, and our business could suffer if we are unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors that could adversely affect our profitability and ability to compete in the transportation industry. We face significant competition in local, regional, national, and, to a lesser extent, international markets. ABF Freight competes with many other LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads. Our Panther and ABF Logistics businesses compete with domestic and global logistics service providers which compete in one or more segments of the transportation industry. Numerous factors could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively in the transportation and logistics industry, retain our existing  16 Table of Contentscustomers, or attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These competitive factors include, but are not limited to, the following:  ·Some of our competitors have greater capital resources, a lower cost structure, greater market share, or a broader coverage network than we do or have other competitive advantages. ·Our nonunion competitors generally have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling and driving personnel than union carriers, and our nonunion competitors may have greater operating flexibility. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors allow for a lower cost structure than ours and may impact our competitiveness in the LTL industry. ·Some of our competitors, such as railroads, are outside the motor carrier freight transportation industry, and certain challenges specific to the motor carrier freight transportation industry, including the competitive freight rate environment; capacity restraints in times of growing freight volumes; increased costs and potential shortages of commercial truck drivers; changes to driver hours-of-service requirements; increased costs of fuel and other operating expenses; and costs of compliance with existing and potential legal and environmental regulations, could result in the service offerings of these competitors being more competitive. ·Some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices. If customers select transportation service providers based on price alone rather than the total value offered, we may be unable to maintain our operating margins or to maintain or grow tonnage levels. ·Customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors. ·Customers may reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. ·Certain of our competitors may offer a broader portfolio of services or more effectively bundle their service offerings, which could impair our ability to maintain or grow our share of one or more markets in which we compete. ·Competition in the LTL industry from asset-light logistics and freight brokerage companies may adversely affect customer relationships and prices in our ABF Freight operations. Conversely, our ABF Logistics and Panther businesses may be adversely impacted if customers develop their own logistics operations, thus reducing demand for our services, or if shippers shift business to truckload brokerage companies or asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies’ trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight industry-wide capacity. ·The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger LTL carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size. ABF Freight could experience some competitive difficulties if the remaining LTL carriers, in fact, realize advantages because of their size. Industry consolidations could also result in our competitors providing a more comprehensive set of services at competitive prices, which could adversely affect our results of operations. ·Based on economic conditions and industry trends, customers may transition traditional LTL business to truckload shipments. Under certain economic conditions, shipment sizes can increase, prompting shippers to utilize truckload carriers rather than LTL carriers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if our long-haul LTL business is reduced by the trend toward truckload consolidation, whereby a customer gathers groups of shipments, which were traditionally transported by long-haul LTL, into full loads which are tendered to a truckload carrier that will transport them to a distant distribution point where they are then transferred to various carriers as short-haul LTL shipments to the ultimate consignees. ·Advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher freight rates to cover the costs of these investments. Our business operations are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and costs of compliance with, or liability for violations of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, operations of ocean freight forwarders and ocean transportation intermediaries, safety, contract compliance, insurance and bonding requirements, tariff and trade policies, customs, import and export, employment practices, licensing and registration, taxation, environmental matters, data privacy and security, and financial reporting. We could become subject to new or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to engine emissions,  17 Table of Contentsdrivers’ hours of service, occupational safety and health, ergonomics, or cargo security. Increases in costs to comply with such regulations or the failure to comply, which could subject us to penalties or revocation of our permits or licenses, could increase our operating expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Such regulations could also influence the demand for transportation services. Our failures, or the failures of our contracted owner operators and third-party carriers, to comply with DOT safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety rating could cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time could materially increase insurance costs or we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage. The FMCSA’s final rule on ELDs became effective in February 2016 and carriers are required to be in compliance with the mandate by December 2017. We have incurred significant costs to equip our fleet with ELDs and we will continue to incur costs to comply with the ELD mandate, which will increase our operating expenses. Further, many states have initiated enforcement programs to evaluate the classification of independent contractors, and class actions and other lawsuits have arisen in our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers’ compensation, wage-and-hour, and health care coverage. There can be no assurance that legislative, judicial, or regulatory authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations resulting in the reclassification of the owner operators of our Panther segment as employees. In the event of such reclassification of our owner operators, we could be exposed to various liabilities and additional costs and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. These liabilities and additional costs could include exposure, for both future and prior periods, under federal, state, and local tax laws, and workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, and employment laws, as well as potential liability for penalties and interest, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of our Panther segment. Our asset-light logistics segments utilize third-party service providers who are subject to similar regulation requirements as previously mentioned. If the operations of these providers are impacted to the extent that a shortage of quality third-party service providers occurs, there could be a material adverse effect on the operating results and business growth of our asset-light logistics segments. Also, activities by these providers that violate applicable laws or regulations could result in government or third party actions against us. Although third-party service providers with whom we contract agree to abide by our policies and procedures, we may not be aware of, and may therefore be unable to remedy, violations by them. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. The costs of compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations may be significant and could adversely impact our results of operations. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials and similar matters. We may transport or arrange for the transportation of hazardous materials and explosives, and we operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. At certain ABF Freight facilities, we store fuel in underground and aboveground tanks and/or we operate with non-discharge certifications or stormwater permits under the federal Clean Water Act. We may be subject to substantial fines or civil penalties if we fail to obtain proper certifications or permits or if we do not comply with required testing provisions. Our operations involve the risks of, among others, fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal. Under certain environmental laws, we could be subject to strict liability for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the cleanup of accidents involving our vehicles. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, violations of applicable laws or regulations may subject us to cleanup costs and liabilities not covered by insurance or in excess of our applicable insurance coverage, including substantial fines, civil penalties, or civil and criminal liability, as well as bans on making future shipments in particular geographic areas, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, if any damage or injury occurs as a result of our transportation of hazardous materials or explosives, we may be subject to claims from third parties and bear liability for such damage or injury. Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant and increasing legislative and regulatory efforts to limit carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, and some form(s) of federal, state, or regional climate change legislation is possible in the future. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future  18 Table of Contentsclimate change legislation. However, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could impose substantial costs on us that may adversely impact our results of operations. Such regulatory actions have also required vendors to introduce new engines, and the maintenance demands and reliability of vehicles equipped with these newly designed engines, as well as the residual values realized from the disposition of these vehicles, is uncertain. Such regulatory actions may also require changes in our operating practices and impair equipment productivity. We are also subject to increasing customer sensitivity to sustainability issues, and we may be subject to additional requirements related to customer-led initiatives or their efforts to comply with environmental programs. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future regulation or customer requirements become known, we cannot predict their effect on our cost structure or our operating results. Furthermore, although we are committed to mandatory and voluntary sustainability practices, increased awareness and any adverse publicity about greenhouse gas emissions emitted by companies in the transportation industry could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our services. We may be unsuccessful in realizing all or any part of the anticipated benefits of any recent or future acquisitions. As part of our long-term strategy to ensure we are positioned to serve our customers within the changing marketplace by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services, we have strategically invested in our asset-light logistics businesses with the acquisitions of Smart Lines Transportation Group, LLC and Bear Transportation Services, L.P. during 2015. We continue to evaluate acquisition candidates and may acquire assets and businesses that we believe complement our existing assets and business or enhance our service offerings. The processes of evaluating acquisitions and performing due diligence procedures include risks which may adversely impact the success of our selection of candidates, pricing of the transaction, and ability to integrate critical functional areas of the acquired business. Further, we may not be able to acquire any additional companies at all or on terms favorable to us. Certain of our larger, better capitalized competitors may seek to acquire some of the companies we may be interested in, and competition for acquisitions would likely increase acquisition prices and result in us having fewer acquisition opportunities. Acquisitions may require substantial capital or the incurrence of substantial indebtedness or may involve the dilutive issuance of equity securities. If we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. We may be unable to generate sufficient revenue from the operation of an acquired business to offset our acquisition or investment costs. The degree of success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and growth opportunities. Our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depends, in part, upon the successful integration of any acquired businesses. The possible difficulties of integration include, among others: retention of customers, key employees, and third-party service providers; unanticipated issues in the assimilation and consolidation of information, communications, and other systems; consolidation of corporate and administrative infrastructures; difficulties managing businesses that are outside our historical core competency; inefficiencies and difficulties that arise because of unfamiliarity with potentially new markets or geographic areas and new assets and the businesses associated with them; the effect on internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities. The risks involved in successful integration could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition or multiple acquisitions within a short period of time. The diversion of management’s attention from our current operations to the acquired operations and any difficulties encountered in combining operations, including underestimation of the resources required to support the acquisitions, could prevent us from realizing the full benefits anticipated from the acquisitions and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Also, following an acquisition, we may discover previously unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business for which we have no recourse under applicable indemnification provisions. If acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows, we may incur impairments of goodwill, intangibles, and other assets in the future. We depend on our employees to support our business operations and future growth opportunities. If our relationship with our employees deteriorates; if we have difficulty attracting and retaining employees and/or independent owner operators for Panther’s operations; or if ABF Freight is unable to reach agreement on future collective bargaining agreements, we could be faced with labor inefficiencies, disruptions, or stoppages, or delayed growth, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reduce our operating results, and place us at a further disadvantage relative to nonunion competitors. As of December 2015, approximately 77% of ABF Freight’s employees were covered under the ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT which extends through March 31, 2018. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements or the inability to agree on acceptable terms for the next contract period may result in a work  19 Table of Contentsstoppage, the loss of customers, or other events that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. We could also experience a loss of customers or a reduction in our potential share of business in the markets we serve if shippers limit their use of unionized freight transportation service providers because of the risk of work stoppages. ABF Freight operates in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion motor carriers. ABF Freight’s nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure and less stringent labor work rules, and certain carriers also have lower wage rates for their freight-handling and driving personnel. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors also allow for a lower cost structure than that of ABF Freight. Under its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry, which continues to adversely impact our operating results relative to our competitors. We have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel for ABF Freight, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels, and the available pool of drivers has been declining. Difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and freight-handling personnel or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect our profitability and our ability to grow. Government regulations or the adverse impact of certain legislative actions which result in shortages of qualified drivers could also impact our ability to grow the company. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business. In addition to difficulties we may experience in driver retention, if we are unable to effectively manage our relationship with the IBT, we could be less effective in ongoing relations and future negotiations, which could lead to operational inefficiencies and increased operating costs. The driver fleet of our Panther segment is made up of independent owner operators and individuals. We face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified owner operators from the available pool of drivers and fleets, and we may be required to increase owner operator compensation or take other measures to remain an attractive option for owner operators, which may negatively impact our results of operations. If we are not able to maintain our delivery schedules due to a shortage of drivers or if we are required to increase our rates to offset increases in labor costs, our services may be less competitive which could have an adverse effect on our business. Our ability to maintain and grow our business will also depend, in part, on our ability to retain and attract additional sales representatives and other key operational personnel and properly incentivize them to obtain new customers, maintain existing customer relationships, and efficiently manage our business. If we are unable to maintain or expand our sales and operational workforce, our ability to increase our revenues and operate our business could be negatively impacted. Our business is cyclical in nature, and we are subject to general economic factors and instability in financial and credit markets that are largely beyond our control, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business is cyclical in nature and tends to reflect general economic conditions. Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles, downturns in customers’ business cycles, and changes in their business practices. Our tonnage and shipment levels are directly affected by industrial production and manufacturing, distribution, residential and commercial construction, and consumer spending, in each case, primarily in the North American economy, as well as our customers’ inventory levels and capacity in the trucking industry. Recessionary economic conditions may result in a general decline in demand for freight transportation and logistics services. The pricing environment generally becomes more competitive during periods of slow economic growth and economic recessions, which adversely affects the profit margin for our services. Economic conditions could adversely affect our customers’ business levels, the amount of transportation services they require, and their ability to pay for our services, thus negatively impacting our working capital and our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and covenants of our financing arrangements. Because a portion of our costs are fixed, it may be difficult for us to quickly adjust our structure proportionately with fluctuations in volume levels. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greater potential for uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increase our allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. For our asset-light logistics businesses, our obligation to pay third-party service providers is not contingent upon payment from our customers, and we extend credit to certain of these customers which increases our exposure to uncollectible receivables.  We depend on suppliers for equipment, parts, and services that are critical to our operations. A disruption in the availability or a significant increase in the cost to obtain these supplies, resulting from the effect of adverse economic conditions or  20 Table of Contentsrelated financial constraints on our suppliers’ business levels or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. We are affected by the instability in the financial and credit markets that from time to time has created volatility in various interest rates and returns on invested assets in recent years. We are subject to market risk due to variable interest rates on our accounts receivable securitization program and the revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) outstanding under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Although we have an interest rate swap agreement to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk by effectively converting $50.0 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility, of which $70.0 million remains outstanding at the end of February 2016, from variable-rate interest to fixed-rate interest, changes in interest rates may increase our financing costs related to our Credit Facility, future borrowings against our accounts receivable securitization program, new capital lease or note payable arrangements, or additional sources of financing. Furthermore, future financial market disruptions may adversely affect our ability to refinance our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program, maintain our letter of credit arrangements or, if needed, secure alternative sources of financing. If any of the financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to us are adversely affected by economic conditions, disruption to the capital and credit markets, or increased regulation, they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to borrow additional funds, and thus have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. (See Note G to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our financing arrangements.) Our qualified nonunion defined benefit pension plan trust holds investments in equity and debt securities. Declines in the value of plan assets resulting from instability in the financial markets, general economic downturn, or other economic factors beyond our control could further diminish the funded status of the nonunion defined benefit pension plan and potentially increase our requirement to make contributions to the plan. A change in the interest rates used to calculate our funding requirements under the PPA may impact contributions required to fund our plan. Significant plan contribution requirements could reduce the cash available for working capital and other business needs and opportunities. An increase in required pension plan contributions may adversely impact our financial condition and liquidity. Substantial future investment losses on pension plan assets would increase pension expense in the years following the losses. In addition, a change in the discount rate used to calculate our obligations for our nonunion defined benefit pension plan and postretirement health benefit plan for financial statement purposes would impact the accumulated benefit obligation and expense for these plans. An increase in expense for these pension and postretirement plans may adversely impact our results of operations. We could also experience losses on investments related to our cash surrender value of variable life insurance policies, which may negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, it is not possible to predict the effects of actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, or political and/or civil unrest on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States or the impact, if any, on our future results of operations or financial condition. Our total assets include goodwill and intangibles. If we determine that these items have become impaired in the future, our earnings could be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2015, we had recorded goodwill of $96.5 million and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $76.8 million. Our goodwill and intangible assets resulted from acquisitions in the asset-light logistics segments, including the acquisition of Panther on June 15, 2012. Panther and ABF Logistics are each evaluated as a separate reporting unit for the impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets. Our annual impairment evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2015, 2014, and 2013 produced no indication of impairment of the recorded balances. However, significant declines in business levels or other changes in cash flow assumptions or other factors that negatively impact the fair value of the operations of Panther or ABF Logistics could result in impairment and a resulting non-cash write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. We depend on services provided by third parties, and increased costs or disruption of these services, and claims arising from these services, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and customer relationships. A reduction in the availability of rail services or services provided by third-party capacity providers to meet customer requirements, as well as higher utilization of third-party agents to maintain service levels in periods of tonnage growth, could increase purchased transportation costs which we may be unable to pass along to our customers. If a disruption or  21 Table of Contentsreduction in transportation services from our rail or other third-party service providers were to occur, we could be faced with business interruptions that could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate competitive contracts with railroads to expand our capacity, add additional routes, obtain multiple providers, or obtain railroad services at costs which are acceptable to us or our customers, any of which could limit our ability to provide this service. If these situations occur, our results of operations, cash flows, and customer relationships could be adversely impacted. Our ability to secure the services of such third-party service providers is affected by many risks beyond our control. The inability to obtain the services of reliable third parties at competitive prices; the shortage of quality third-party providers, including owner operators for Panther and drivers of contracted truckload carriers for the brokerage operations of ABF Logistics; shortages in available cargo capacity; equipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers; changes in regulations impacting transportation; labor disputes; or a significant interruption in service or stoppage in third-party transportation services could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our asset-light logistics businesses.  Third-party providers can be expected to increase their prices based on market conditions or to cover increases in operating expenses. These providers are subject to industry regulations which may have a significant impact on their operations, causing them to increase prices or exit the industry. Increased industry demand for these transportation services may reduce available capacity and such a reduction or other changes in these services offered by third parties may increase pricing or otherwise change the services we are able to offer to our customers. If we are unable to correspondingly increase the prices we charge to our customers, or if we are unable to secure sufficient third-party services to meet our commitments to our customers, there could be a material adverse impact on the operations, revenues, and profitability of our asset-light logistics businesses and our customer relationships. In addition, we may be subject to claims arising from services provided by third parties, particularly in connection with our Panther and ABF Logistics operations, which are dependent on third-party contract carriers. From time to time, the drivers who are employees, owner operators, or independent contractors working for third-party carriers that we contract with are involved in accidents that may result in cargo loss or damage, other property damage, or serious personal injuries. As a result, claims may be asserted against us for actions by such drivers or for our actions in retaining them. We may also incur claims in connection with third-party vendors utilized in FleetNet’s operations. Our third-party contract carriers and other vendors may not agree to bear responsibility for such claims or we may become responsible if they are unable to pay the claims, for example, due to bankruptcy proceedings, and such claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance at all. We are subject to litigation risks that could result in significant expenditures and have other material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, competitive matters, personal injury, property damage, cargo claims, safety and contract compliance, environmental liability, and other matters. We are subject to risk and uncertainties related to liabilities which may result from the cost of defending against class-action litigation, such as alleged violations of anti-trust laws, wage-and-hour, and discrimination claims, and any other legal proceedings. Some or all of our expenditures to defend, settle, or litigate these matters may not be covered by insurance or could impact our cost and ability to obtain insurance in the future. Also, litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and could require a substantial amount of time and effort by our management team.  Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our business reputation and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, and employees may also be adversely impacted by our involvement in legal proceedings. For more information related to the Company’s legal proceedings, see Note O to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We establish reserves based on our assessment of legal matters and contingencies. Subsequent developments related to legal claims asserted against us may affect our assessment and estimates of our recorded legal reserves and may require  22 Table of Contentsus to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Claims expenses or the cost of maintaining our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Claims may be asserted against us for accidents or for cargo loss or damage, property damage, personal injury, and workers’ compensation occurring in our operations. Claims may also be asserted against us for accidents involving the operations of third-party service providers that we utilize for our asset-light logistics segments, for our actions in retaining their services, or for loss or damage to our customers’ goods for which we are determined to be responsible. Such claims against us may not be covered by insurance policies or may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. We have established liabilities which are adjusted to reflect our claims experience; however, actual claims costs and legal expenses may exceed our estimates. If the frequency and/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results. We are self-insured for workers’ compensation, third-party casualty loss, and cargo loss or damage claims for the operations of ABF Freight and certain of our other subsidiaries. We also self-insure for medical benefits for our eligible nonunion personnel. Because we self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure and related expenses, our insurance and claims expense may be volatile. If we lose our ability to self-insure for any significant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event. ABF Freight’s self-insurance program for third-party casualty claims is conducted under a federal program administered by a government agency. If the government were to terminate the program or if ABF Freight were to be excluded from the program, our insurance costs could increase. Additionally, if our third-party insurance carriers or underwriters leave the trucking sector, it could materially increase our insurance costs or collateral requirements, or create difficulties in finding insurance in excess of our self-insured retention limits. We could also experience additional increases in our insurance premiums or deductibles in the future due to market conditions or if our claims experience worsens. If our insurance or claims expense increases, or if we decide to increase our insurance coverage in the future, and we are unable to offset any increase in expense with higher revenues, our earnings could be adversely affected. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Significant increases in health care costs related to medical inflation, claims experience, current and future federal and state laws and regulations, and other cost components that are beyond our control could significantly increase the costs of our self-insured medical plans and postretirement medical costs, or require us to adjust the level of benefits offered to our employees. In particular, with the passage in 2010 of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “PPACA”), we are required to provide health care benefits to all full-time employees that meet certain minimum requirements of coverage and affordability, or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria set forth in the PPACA. Many of these requirements have been phased in over time, with the majority of the most impactful provisions affecting us having begun in the second quarter of 2015. The PPACA also requires individuals to obtain coverage or face individual penalties, so employees who are currently eligible but have elected not to participate in our health care plans may ultimately find it more advantageous to do so. In general, implementing the requirements of health care reform is likely to impose additional administrative costs. The costs of maintaining and monitoring compliance and reports and other effects of these new healthcare requirements, including any failure to comply, may significantly increase our health care coverage costs and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We have programs in place with multiple surety companies for the issuance of unsecured surety bonds in support of our self-insurance program for workers’ compensation and third-party casualty. Estimates made by the states and the surety companies of our future exposure for our self-insurance liabilities could influence the amount and cost of additional letters of credit and surety bonds required to support our self-insurance program, and we may be required to maintain secured surety bonds in the future which could increase the amount of our cash equivalents and short-term investments restricted for use and unavailable for operational or capital requirements. We depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, changes in fuel prices, and the inability to collect fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. A disruption in our fuel supply resulting from natural or man-made disasters, armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, actions by producers, or other political,  23 Table of Contentseconomic, and market factors that are beyond our control could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We maintain fuel storage and pumping facilities at our distribution centers and certain other terminals; however, we may experience shortages in the availability of fuel at certain locations and may be forced to incur additional expense to ensure adequate supply on a timely basis to prevent a disruption to our service schedules. Fuel represents a significant operating expense for us, and we do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts or any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to factors beyond our control, such as political events, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, and hurricanes and other natural or man-made disasters, and fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Significant increases in fuel prices or fuel taxes resulting from these or other economic or regulatory changes which are not offset by base freight rate increases or fuel surcharges could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Our ABF Freight and Panther segments charge a fuel surcharge based on an index of national diesel fuel prices. Although revenues from fuel surcharges generally more than offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs, we incur certain fuel costs that cannot be recovered with fuel surcharges, and other operating costs have been, and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of energy prices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. We cannot predict, with reasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of energy prices on other cost elements, recoverability of fuel costs through fuel surcharges, and the effect of fuel surcharges on our overall rate structure or the total price that we will receive from our customers. Whether fuel prices fluctuate or remain constant, operating results may be adversely affected if competitive pressures limit our ability to recover fuel surcharges. Throughout 2015, the fuel surcharge mechanism generally continued to have market acceptance among our customers; however, certain nonstandard pricing arrangements have limited the amount of fuel surcharge recovered. The negative impact on operating margins of capped fuel surcharge revenue during periods of increasing fuel costs is more evident when fuel prices remain above the maximum levels recovered through the fuel surcharge mechanism on certain accounts. Also, because our fuel surcharge recovery lags behind changes in fuel prices, our fuel surcharge recovery may not capture in any particular period the increased costs we pay for fuel, especially in periods in which fuel prices rapidly increase. In periods of declining fuel prices, which we have experienced since third quarter 2014, our fuel surcharge percentages also decrease, which negatively impacts our revenues, and the revenue decline may be disproportionate to our fuel costs. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer. When fuel surcharges constitute a higher proportion of the total freight rate paid, our customers are less receptive to increases in base freight rates. Prolonged periods of inadequate base rate improvements could adversely impact operating results as elements of costs, including contractual wage rates, continue to increase. Further, during periods of low freight volumes, shippers can use their negotiating leverage to impose less compensatory fuel surcharge policies. Higher fuel prices cause customers of our FleetNet segment to seek cost savings throughout their businesses which may result in a reduction of miles driven and/or a deferral of maintenance practices that may reduce the volume of our maintenance service events, resulting in an adverse impact on the segment’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Increased prices for, or decreases in the availability of, new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipment, as well as higher costs of equipment-related operating expenses, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In recent years, manufacturers have raised the prices of new revenue equipment significantly due to increased costs of materials and, in part, to offset their costs of compliance with new tractor engine and emissions system design requirements intended to reduce emissions, which have been mandated by the EPA, the NHTSA, and various state agencies such as those described in “Environmental and Other Government Regulations” of the Freight Transportation (ABF Freight) Segment section of “Business” in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Greenhouse gas emissions regulations are likely to continue to impact the design and cost of equipment utilized in our operations. A number of states have mandated, and California and certain other states may continue to individually mandate, additional emission-control requirements for equipment which could increase equipment costs for entire fleets that operate in interstate commerce. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. Our third-party capacity providers, including Panther’s owner operators, are also subject to increased regulations and higher equipment prices which will, in turn, increase our costs for utilizing their services or may cause certain providers to exit the industry which could lead to a capacity shortage and further increase our costs of securing third-party services. If we  24 Table of Contentsare unable to fully offset any such increases in expenses with freight rate increases and/or improved fuel economy, our results of operations could be adversely affected.   Reduced fuel demand due to improved fuel economy may result in legislative efforts to increase fuel taxes which, if enacted, could significantly increase our costs. If we are not able to adequately increase our freight rates, recover fuel surcharges, or recognize fuel economy savings to offset increases in equipment and maintenance costs, and if we are not able to offset fuel tax increases through reductions in other excise taxes or through increases in the rates we charge our customers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We may face difficulty in purchasing new equipment due to decreased supply. From time to time, some original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of tractors and trailers may reduce their manufacturing output due to, for example, lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of component parts. Component suppliers may either reduce production or be unable to increase production to meet OEM demand, creating periodic difficulty for OEMs to react in a timely manner to increased demand for new equipment and/or increased demand for replacement components as economic conditions change. At times, market forces may create market situations in which demand outstrips supply. In those situations, we may face reduced supply levels and/or increased acquisition costs. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers for our ABF Freight operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. During prolonged periods of decreased tonnage levels, we and other trucking companies may make strategic fleet reductions, which could result in an increase in the supply of used equipment. When the supply exceeds the demand for used revenue equipment, the general market value of used revenue equipment decreases. Used equipment prices are also subject to substantial fluctuations based on availability of financing and commodity prices for scrap metal. If market prices for used revenue equipment decline, corresponding decreases in our established salvage values on equipment being used in our ABF Freight operations would increase our depreciation expense, and we could incur impairment losses on assets held for sale which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  Our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and other key employees and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of key employees or inability to execute our succession planning strategies could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability if we are unable to secure replacement personnel that have sufficient experience in our industry and in the management of our business.  If we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation and the ABF, Panther, U-Pack and other brands and related intellectual property, our business may suffer.  The costs and resources expended to enforce or protect our trademarks or other intellectual property could adversely impact our results of operations. ABF Freight is recognized as an industry leader for its commitment to quality, customer service, safety, and technology. Our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the image of the ABF brand as it applies to both ABF Freight and ABF Logistics. The Panther brand is also synonymous with premium service. Service, performance, and safety issues, whether actual or perceived and whether as a result of our actions or those of our third-party contract carriers and their drivers and owner operators, could adversely impact our customers’ image of the ABF companies, Panther, and U‑Pack and result in the loss of business or impede our growth initiatives. Adverse publicity regarding labor relations, legal matters, environmental concerns, and similar matters, which are connected to ABF Freight, whether or not justified, could have a negative impact on our reputation and may result in the loss of customers and our inability to secure new customer relationships, as well as hinder the growth of our asset-light logistics businesses. Our business and our image could also be negatively impacted by a breach of our corporate policies by employees or vendors. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our services and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.  We have registered “ArcBest Corporation,” “ABF,” “FleetNet America,” “Panther,” and “U-Pack” and various related marks or designs, such as “The Skill & The Will” and “U-Pack We Drive. You Save.” as trademarks in the United States and, for some marks, we have registered or are pursuing registration in certain other countries. At times, competitors may adopt service names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market  25 Table of Contentsconfusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered trademarks. From time to time, we have acquired or attempted to acquire Internet domain names held by others when such names have caused consumer confusion or had the potential to cause consumer confusion. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. Our initiatives to grow our business operations or to manage our cost structure to business levels may take longer than anticipated or may not be successful. Developing service offerings requires ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure, including operating and management information systems. Depending upon the timing and level of revenues generated from our growth initiatives, the related results of operations and cash flows we anticipate from these initiatives and additional service offerings may not be achieved. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. Our growth plans place significant demands on our management and operating personnel and we may not be able to hire, train, and retain the appropriate personnel to manage and grow these services. In addition, as we focus on growing our asset-light logistics businesses, we may encounter difficulties in adapting our corporate structure or in developing and maintaining effective partnerships among our operating segments which could hinder our operational, financial, and strategic objectives. Furthermore, we may invest significant resources to enter or expand our services in markets with established competitors, and we may not be able to successfully gain market share which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. We also face challenges and risks in implementing initiatives to manage our cost structure to business levels. We periodically evaluate and modify the ABF Freight network to reflect changes in customer demands and to reconcile ABF Freight’s infrastructure with tonnage levels and the proximity of customer freight, and there can be no assurance that these network changes, to the extent such network changes are made, will result in a material improvement of ABF Freight’s results of operations. Our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program contain customary financial and other customary restrictive covenants that may limit our future operations. A default under these financing arrangements or changes in regulations which impact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which governs our Credit Facility, contains representations and warranties, conditions, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type including, but not limited to, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a maximum adjusted leverage ratio, and limitations on incurrence of debt, investments, liens on assets, certain sale and leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Our accounts receivable securitization program also contains affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are customary for financings of this type, including a maximum adjusted leverage ratio and requirements to maintain certain characteristics of the receivables, such as rates of delinquency, default, and dilution. If we default under the terms of our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or our accounts receivable securitization program and fail to obtain appropriate amendments to or waivers under the applicable financing arrangement, our borrowings under such facilities could be immediately declared due and payable. In the event of a default under either of these facilities, we could automatically default on the other of these facilities and on our outstanding notes payable and other financing agreements, unless the lenders to these facilities choose not to exercise remedies or to otherwise allow us to cure the default. If we fail to pay the amount due under our Credit Facility or accounts payable securitization program, the lenders could proceed against the collateral by which our Credit Facility is secured, our borrowing capacity may be limited, or the facilities could be terminated. If acceleration of outstanding borrowings occurs or if the facilities are terminated, we may have difficulty borrowing additional funds sufficient to refinance the accelerated debt or entering into new credit or debt arrangements, and, if available, the terms of the financing may not be acceptable. A default under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or accounts receivable securitization program or changes in regulations which  26 Table of Contentsimpact the availability of funds or our costs to borrow under our financing arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition. In addition, failing to achieve certain financial ratios as required by our Credit Facility and accounts receivable securitization program could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions or investments, or plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations or obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms or properly forecast capital needs to correspond with business volumes. We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash from operations in the future, our growth could be limited; it may be necessary for us to utilize our existing financing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing or financing arrangements, possibly on less favorable terms; or our revenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increased expenditures for maintenance. Forecasting business volumes involves many factors, including general economic trends and the impact of competition, which are subject to uncertainty and beyond our control. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, especially for revenue equipment, in relation to corresponding business levels, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity. In addition, our Credit Facility contains provisions that could limit our level of annual capital expenditures. If we were unable to properly forecast capital needs and/or were unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, obtain adequate financing at acceptable terms, or if our capital spending was otherwise limited, there could be an adverse effect on our business, profitability, and growth.  Our results of operations could be impacted by seasonal fluctuations or adverse weather conditions. Our operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels and, consequently, revenues and operating results. Freight shipments and operating costs of the ABF Freight and ABF Logistics operating segments can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The first quarter of each year generally has the lowest tonnage levels; at the same time, operating expenses may increase due to, among other things, a decline in fuel economy because of higher fuel density in colder temperatures, and higher accident frequency, increased claims, and potentially higher equipment repair expenditures caused by harsh weather. Expedited shipments of the Panther segment may decline due to post-holiday slowdowns during winter months and plant shutdowns during summer months. Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are influenced by seasonal variations, and service event volume is generally lower during mild weather conditions. Business levels of the ABF Moving segment are generally lower in the non-summer months when demand for moving services is typically lower. In addition to the impact of weather on seasonal business trends, severe weather events and natural disasters, such as harsh winter weather, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes, could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers or disrupt fuel supplies or increase fuel costs, each of which could adversely affect our business levels and operating results. Climate change may have an influence on the severity of weather conditions, which could adversely affect our freight shipments and level of services provided by our asset-light logistics segments and, consequently, our operating results. We are subject to certain risks arising from our international business. We provide transportation and logistics services to and from international locations and are, therefore, subject to risks of international business, including, but not limited to, changes in the economic strength of certain foreign countries; social, political, and economic instability; the ability to secure space on third-party aircraft, ocean vessels, and other modes of transportation; burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States regulations and export and import laws as well as different liability standards and less developed legal systems; difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights; changes in foreign exchange rates; and restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by foreign governments, and changes in international tax laws and regulations. In addition, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, and insurrections could impede our ability to provide satisfactory services to customers in international locations. We are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and hold Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT’) status for businesses within our ABF Freight, Panther, and ABF Logistics segments. Failure to comply with the FCPA and local regulations in the conduct of our international business operations may result in criminal and civil penalties against us. If we are unable to maintain our C-TPAT status, we may face a loss of certain  27 Table of Contentsbusiness due to customer requirements to deal only with C-TPAT participating carriers, because of the enhanced levels of supply chain security provided by participating in the C-TPAT program. In addition, loss of C-TPAT status for Panther may result in significant border delays for the segment, which could cause its international operations to be less efficient than competitors also operating internationally.  Our business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures. As a result of actual or threatened terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state, and municipal authorities have implemented and may implement in the future various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. Although many companies would be adversely affected by any slowdown in the availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our business disproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. If security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased costs in order to do so. Additional security measures may also reduce productivity of our drivers and third-party transportation service providers, which would increase our operating costs. There can be no assurance that new antiterrorism measures will not be implemented and that such new measures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.   28 Table of Contents"

14,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2009-02-20,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  continuedAs previously mentioned, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact theviability of contributing employers. The effect of any one or combination of these business risks,which are outside our control, has the potential to affect the funding status of the multiemployerpension plans, potential withdrawal liabilities and our future contribution requirements.Our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that are beyond our control.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating ourbusiness. These systems include our communications and data processing systems. Our informationsystems are protected through physical and software safeguards. However, they are still vulnerableto fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins andsimilar events. To mitigate the potential for such occurrences to disrupt business operations atour corporate headquarters, we have implemented various systems including redundanttelecommunication facilities; a fire suppression system to protect our on-site data center; and agenerator that is able to adequately supply power to the headquarters building in the event ofpower outages. We have a catastrophic disaster recovery plan and alternate processing capability,which is designed so that critical data processes should be fully operational within 48 hours. Thisplan provides for work space, phones, and desktop computers for employees who are critical to basicoperations within 48 hours of a catastrophe which renders our corporate headquarters unusable. Anemergency communications Web site has also been constructed to provide information to our employeesand customers during such a disaster. We have business interruption insurance, including, incertain circumstances, insurance against terrorist attacks under the federal Terrorism RiskInsurance Act of 2002, which would offset losses up to certain coverage limits in the event of acatastrophe.

5,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2008-02-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSEach of the following risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results andfinancial condition. Our operations include our primary operating subsidiary, ABF. For 2007, ABFrepresented 96.4% of the Companys consolidated revenues.The transportation industry is affected by business risks that are largely out of our control, anyof which could significantly reduce our operating margins and income.The factors that could have a negative impact on our performance in the future include generaleconomic factors; loss of key employees; antiterrorism measures; an increasingly competitivefreight rate environment; volatile fuel prices and the inability to collect fuel surcharges orobtain sufficient fuel supplies; loss of third-party rail service providers; increasing capitalrequirements; increases in new equipment costs and decreases in the amount we are able to obtainfor sales of our used equipment; emissions-control regulations; decreases in the availability ofnew equipment; increases in the frequency and/or the severity of workers compensation and/orthird-party casualty claims; increases in workers compensation and/or third-party casualtyinsurance premiums; violation of federal regulations and increasing costs for compliance withregulations; a workforce stoppage by our employees covered under our collective bargainingagreement; difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and/or dockworkers; increasesin the required contributions under our collective bargaining agreements with the IBT for wagecontributions and/or benefits contributions to multiemployer plans; a failure of our informationsystems; a violation of an environmental law or regulation; and/or weather or seasonalfluctuations.We are subject to general economic factors that are largely beyond our control, any of which couldsignificantly reduce our operating margins and income.Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers businesscycles and changes in their business practices. Economic conditions could adversely affect ourcustomers business levels, the amount of transportation services they need and their ability topay for our services. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greaterpotential for uncollectible accounts receivable, and, as a result, we may be required to increaseour allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. In addition, customers could reduce thenumber of carriers they use by selecting so-called core carriers as approved transportationservice providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.It is not possible to predict the effects of armed conflicts or terrorist attacks and subsequentevents on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States, or the impact, if any, on ourfuture results of operations or financial condition.Our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair oursuccess.We benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and depend on theircontinued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of keyemployees could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability. We continue to developand retain a core group of officers and managers although future retention cannot be assured.10Table of ContentsOur business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures.Since the terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state and municipal authorities haveimplemented and are implementing various security measures, including checkpoints and travelrestrictions on large trucks. Although many companies will be adversely affected by any slowdown inthe availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our businessdisproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. Ifthe new security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of ourcustomers or could incur increased costs in order to do so.We operate in a highly competitive industry and our business could suffer if our operatingsubsidiaries were unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors thatcould adversely affect their ability to compete with other companies.Numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability. Thesefactors include:  We compete with many other LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union andnonunion LTL carriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads.   Our nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for theirfreight-handling and driving personnel than union carriers. However, we believe that wehave lower turnover rates and higher labor efficiency rates than some of our competitors.Our competitors could reduce their freight rates to gain market share, especially duringtimes of reduced growth rates in the economy. This could limit our ability to maintain orincrease freight rates, maintain our operating margins or grow tonnage levels.   The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to createlarger LTL carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantagesrelating to their size. We could experience some difficulty if the remaining LTL carriers,in fact, have a competitive advantage because of their size.Our new service and growth initiatives may not be accepted by our customers.Our continuing development of more second-day service lanes, overnight lanes and same-day servicewill require ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure. In addition, the level of revenuesexpected to be generated from these service initiatives may be impacted by actions of ourcompetitors and by general economic conditions. Depending on the timing and level of revenuesgenerated from these service initiatives, our results of operations and cash flows may benegatively impacted.We depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, increases in fuelcosts and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or obtain sufficient fuel supplies could have amaterial adverse effect on our operating results.The transportation industry is dependent upon the availability of adequate fuel supplies. We havenot experienced a lack of available fuel but could be adversely impacted if a fuel shortage were todevelop. Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. ABF charges a fuel surchargebased on changes in diesel fuel prices compared to a national index. The ABF fuel surcharge rate ineffect is available on the ABF Web site at abf.com. Although revenues from fuel surchargesgenerally more than offset increases in direct diesel fuel costs; other operating costs have been,and may continue to be, impacted by fluctuating fuel prices. The total impact of higher energyprices on other nonfuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. ABF cannot predict, withreasonable certainty, future fuel price fluctuations, the impact of higher energy prices on othercost elements, recoverability of higher fuel costs through fuel surcharges, the effect of fuel surcharges on ABFs overall ratestructure or the total price that ABF will receive from its customers. During periods of changingdiesel fuel prices, the fuel11Table of Contentssurcharge and associated direct diesel fuel costs also vary bydifferent degrees. Depending upon the rates of these changes and the impact on costs in other fuel-and energy-related areas, operating margins could be impacted. During 2007, the fuel surchargemechanism continued to have strong market acceptance among ABF customers. Whether fuel pricesfluctuate or remain constant, ABFs operating income may be adversely affected if competitivepressures limit its ability to recover fuel surcharges. ABFs ability to recover future fuelsurcharges may be affected as a result. However, lower fuel surcharge levels may over time improveABFs ability to increase other elements of margin although there can be no assurances in thisregard. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in ABFs overall rate structure, theactual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces based on value provided to the customer.We do not have any long-term fuel purchase contracts and have not entered into any hedgingarrangements to protect against fuel price increases. Significant changes in diesel fuel prices andthe associated fuel surcharge may increase volatility in our reported revenues. Volatile fuelprices will continue to impact our results of operations.We depend on transportation provided by rail services and a disruption of this service couldadversely affect our operations.In 2007, ABFs rail utilization was 12.7% of total miles. If a disruption in transportationservices from the rail service providers occurred, we could be faced with business interruptionsthat could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. If these situations occurred, ourresults of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect profitability if we were unableto generate sufficient cash from operations.We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we were not able to generate sufficient cashfrom operations in the future, our growth could be limited, we could have to utilize our existingfinancing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing arrangements, or ourrevenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increasedmaintenance costs. If these situations occurred, there could be an adverse effect on ourprofitability.Increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipmentcould adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.Manufacturers have raised the prices of new equipment significantly, in part, to offset their costsof compliance with new EPA tractor engine design requirements intended to reduce emissions.Following requirements that were put into place in 2002, new EPA engine design requirements becameeffective on January 1, 2007. More restrictive EPA emission-control design requirements will takeeffect in 2010. Further equipment price increases may result from these requirements. If newequipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higher depreciation and rentalexpenses than anticipated. If we were unable to offset any such increases in expenses with freightrate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. If the market value ofrevenue equipment being used in our operations were to decrease, we could incur impairment lossesand our cash flows could be adversely affected.12Table of ContentsThe engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions-control regulations, whichcould substantially increase operating expenses.Tractor engines that comply with the EPA emission-control design requirements that took effect onJanuary 1, 2007 are generally less fuel-efficient and have increased maintenance costs compared toengines in tractors manufactured before these requirements became effective. In addition,compliance with the more stringent EPA requirements that are scheduled to be effective in 2010could result in further declines in fuel efficiency and increases in maintenance costs. If we areunable to offset resulting increases in fuel expenses or maintenance costs with higher freightrates, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Decreases in the availability of new tractors and trailers could have a material adverse effect onour operating results.From time to time, some tractor and trailer vendors have reduced their manufacturing output due,for example, to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of componentparts. As conditions changed, some of those vendors have had difficulty fulfilling increased demandfor new equipment. Also, vendors must meet the EPA emission-control design requirements that tookeffect on January 1, 2007 and those that are scheduled to be effective in 2010. Some carriers mayseek to purchase large numbers of tractors with pre-2010 engines, which could lead to tractorshortages. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors or trailers couldhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We operate in a highly regulated industry and costs of compliance with, or liability for violationsof, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportationbusiness, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrieroperations, safety, insurance requirements and financial reporting. We could also become subject tonew or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers hoursof service or ergonomics. Compliance with such regulations could substantially reduce equipmentproductivity, and the costs of compliance could increase our operating expenses.In April 2003, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) announced rules regulating drivingtime for commercial truck drivers. The rules, which were implemented in January 2004, have had aminimal impact upon our operations. However, future changes in these rules could materially andadversely affect our operating efficiency and increase costs.Our drivers and dockworkers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated bythe DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. TheTransportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has adoptedregulations that will require all drivers who carry hazardous materials to undergo backgroundchecks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation when they obtain or renew their licenses.Failures to comply with DOT safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have amaterial adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety ratingcould cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for anysignificant period of time could materially increase insurance costs. In addition, we couldexperience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of coverage in that event.Increases in license and registration fees could also have an adverse effect on our operatingresults.13Table of ContentsOngoing claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Our self-insurance retention levels are currently $1.0 million for each workers compensation loss,$1.0 million for each cargo loss and generally $1.0 million for each third-party casualty loss. Formedical benefits, we currently self-insure up to $175,000 per person, per claim year. We maintaininsurance for liabilities above the amounts of self-insurance to certain limits. If the frequencyand/or severity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timingof the incurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating resultscompared to prior periods. In addition, if we were to lose our ability to self-insure for anysignificant period of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experiencedifficulty in obtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event.Increased insurance premium costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.In the last several years, insurance carriers have increased premiums for many companies, includingtransportation companies. Although our recent insurance renewals did not result in significantchanges in premiums, we could experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in thefuture. If our insurance or claims expenses increase and we were unable to offset the increase withhigher freight rates, our earnings could be adversely affected.We depend on our employees to support our operating business and future growth opportunities. Ifour relationship with our employees were to deteriorate, we could be faced with labor disruptionsor stoppages, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and reduce our operatingresults and place us at a disadvantage relative to nonunion competitors.Most of ABFs union employees are covered under a five-year collective bargaining agreement withthe IBT which expires on March 31, 2008. During February 2008, the Company announced that the IBThas ratified a new five-year collective bargaining agreement. The new agreement, which will beeffective April 1, 2008, provides for compounded annual contractual wage and benefit increases of3.8%, subject to wage rate cost-of-living adjustments.We compete against both union and nonunion LTL carriers. Union companies typically have somewhathigher wage costs and significantly higher fringe benefit costs than nonunion companies. Unioncompanies typically experience lower employee turnover and higher productivity compared to somenonunion companies. Due to our national reputation, working conditions, and wages and benefits, wehave not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting or retainingqualified drivers, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certain situations,such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels. Difficulty in attracting and retainingqualified drivers or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affect ourprofitability and our ability to grow. If we were unable to continue to attract and retainqualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business.We could be obligated to make additional contributions to multiemployer pension plans.Under the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act, retirement and health care benefits for ABFscontractual employees are provided by a number of multiemployer plans. The trust funds for theseplans are administered by trustees, an equal number of whom generally are appointed by the IBT andcertain management carrier organizations or other appointing authorities for employer trustees asset forth in the funds trust agreements. ABF is not directly involved in the administration of thetrust funds. ABF contributes to these plans monthly based on the time worked by its contractualemployees, as specified in the collective bargaining agreement and other supporting supplementalagreements. No amounts are required to be paid beyond ABFs monthly contractual obligations basedon the time worked by its employees, except as discussed below. Approximately 50% of ourcontributions are made to the Central States Southeast and Southwest Area Pension Fund (CentralStates Pension Fund). We recognize as expense the contractually required contribution for theperiod and recognize as a liability any contributions due and unpaid. We intend to meet ourobligations to the multiemployer pension plans under our collective bargaining agreement with theIBT.14Table of ContentsIn the event of the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or if we withdraw from amultiemployer pension plan, we would have liabilities for our share of the unfunded vestedliabilities of such plan. ABF has no current intention of withdrawing from any multiemployerpension plan. Based on December 31, 2006, multiemployer pension plan information which is the mostrecently available information, the estimate of ABFs contingent withdrawal liabilities for theseplans is approximately $800 million to $850 million, on a pre-tax basis. Though the bestinformation available to us was used in computing this estimate, it is calculated with numerousassumptions, changes periodically and has not been verified by us or our independent pensioncounsel.In 2006, the Pension Protection Act (the PPA) became law and together with related regulationsestablished certain minimum funding requirements for multiemployer pension plans. The PPA mandatesthat multiemployer plans that are below certain funding levels or that have projected fundingdeficiencies adopt a funding improvement plan or a rehabilitation program to improve the fundinglevels over a defined period of time. The Act also accelerates the timing of annual funding noticesand requires additional disclosures from certain multiemployer plans. Under the PPA, the fundingstatus of such plans is determined by a number of factors including: investment returns, changes inmember benefits, the number of participating employees, the number of employers who contribute andtheir related contractual contributions and the number of employees or retirees participating inthe plan who no longer have a contributing employer. If any multiemployer pension plan fails to:(i) meet minimum funding requirements; (ii) meet a required funding improvement or rehabilitationplan required by the PPA for underfunded plans; (iii) obtain from the IRS certain changes to orwaivers of the requirements used by a particular plan to calculate funding levels; or, (iv) reducepension benefits to a level where the requirements are met, the PPA could impose additionalcontribution requirements on ABF in the form of a surcharge of an additional five to ten percent.However, under our new five-year collective bargaining agreement with the IBT, which will beeffective April 1, 2008, any surcharges required by the Act will be included in the contractualcontribution rate and should not increase ABFs overall contribution obligation.In July 2007, the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee for the Central StatesPension Fund Supplemental Agreement reallocated $0.40 per hour of a previously negotiated $0.70per hour rate increase for health and welfare to the Central States Pension Fund. Thisreallocation will have a positive effect on the funded status of the Central States Pension Fund. In addition, as a result of a withdrawal by a large contributing employer, the CentralStates Pension Fund received $6.1 billion in cash in December 2007, which should have a positiveeffect on its near-term funded status.Despite these events, based on currently available information, we believe that the Central StatesPension Fund and a number of other plans in which ABF participates will have to adopt either afunding improvement plan or a rehabilitation program depending on their current funding status asrequired by the PPA. However, the funding levels of these multiemployer plans in 2008 could varyfrom the December 31, 2006 funded status.As previously mentioned, the highly competitive industry in which we operate could impact theviability of contributing employers. Any one or combination of these items, which are outside ourcontrol, has the potential to affect the funding status of these plans, potential withdrawalliabilities and our future contribution requirements.Our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that are beyond our control.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating ourbusiness. These systems include our communications and data processing systems. Our informationsystems are protected through physical and software safeguards. However, they are still vulnerableto fire, storm, flood, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins andsimilar events. We have a catastrophic disaster recovery plan and alternate processing capability,which is designed so that critical data processes should be fully operational within 48 hours. We have business interruption insurance, including, in certaincircumstances, insurance against terrorist attacks under the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Actof 2002, which would offset15Table of Contentslosses up to certain coverage limits in the event of a catastrophe.However, a significant system failure, security breach, disruption by a virus or other damage couldstill interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation and cause a loss of customers.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of whichcould result in substantial fines or penalties.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardousmaterials and similar matters. We operate in industrial areas where truck terminals and otherindustrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmentalcontamination could occur. We also store fuel in underground tanks at some facilities. Ouroperations involve the risks of fuel spillage or leakage, environmental damage and hazardous wastedisposal, among others. If we were involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardoussubstances, or if we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could havea material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply withapplicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and tocivil and criminal liability.Our results of operations can be impacted by seasonal fluctuations or adverse weather conditions.We can be impacted by seasonal fluctuations which affect tonnage and shipment levels. Freightshipments, operating costs and earnings can also be affected adversely by inclement weatherconditions.We are also subject to risks and uncertainties that affect many other businesses, including:Any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class-action litigation, such asalleged violations of anti-trust laws, wage-and-hour and discrimination claims, and any other legalproceedings;Widespread outbreak of an illness, such as avian influenza (bird flu), severe acute respiratorysyndrome (SARS) or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis; andOperational or market disruptions arising from natural calamities, such as hurricanes, and fromillegal acts including terrorist attacks.Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by an unfavorableoutcome resulting from these risks and uncertainties"
1,ARCB,ARCBEST CORP,2007-02-23,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSEach of the following risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results andfinancial condition. Our operations include our primary operating subsidiary, ABF. For 2006, ABFrepresented 97.3% of the Companys consolidated revenues.The transportation industry is affected by business risks that are largely out of our control, anyof which could significantly reduce our operating margins and income.The factors that could have a negative impact on our performance in the future include generaleconomic factors; loss of key employees; antiterrorism measures; an increasingly competitivefreight rate environment; volatile fuel prices and the inability to collect fuel surcharges orobtain sufficient fuel supplies; loss of third-party rail service providers; increasing capitalrequirements; increases in new equipment costs and decreases in the amount we are able to obtainfor sales of our used equipment; emissions-control regulations; decreases in the availability ofnew equipment; increases in the frequency and/or the severity of workers compensation and/or thirdparty casualty claims; increases in workers compensation and/or third-party casualty insurancepremiums; violation of federal regulations and increasing costs for compliance with regulations; aworkforce stoppage by our employees covered under our collective bargaining agreement; difficultyin attracting and retaining qualified drivers and/or dockworkers; increases in the requiredcontributions under our collective bargaining agreements with the IBT for wage contributions and/orbenefits contributions to multiemployer plans; a failure of our information systems; a violation ofan environmental law or regulation; and/or weather or seasonal fluctuations.We are subject to general economic factors that are largely beyond our control, any of which couldsignificantly reduce our operating margins and income.Our performance is affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers businesscycles and changes in their business practices. Economic conditions could adversely affect ourcustomers business levels, the amount of transportation services they need and their ability topay for our services. Customers encountering adverse economic conditions represent a greaterpotential for uncollectible accounts receivable, and as a result, we may be required to increaseour allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable. In addition, customers could reduce thenumber of carriers they use by selecting so-called core carriers as approved transportationservice providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected.It is not possible to predict the effects of armed conflicts or terrorist attacks and subsequentevents on the economy or on consumer confidence in the United States, or the impact, if any, on ourfuture results of operations or financial condition.Our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key employees could impair oursuccess.We benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and depend on theircontinued services to successfully implement our business strategy. The unexpected loss of keyemployees could have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability. We continue to developand retain a core group of officers and managers although future retention cannot be assured.10Table of ContentsOur business could be harmed by antiterrorism measures.Since the terrorist attacks on the United States, federal, state and municipal authorities haveimplemented and are implementing various security measures, including checkpoints and travelrestrictions on large trucks. Although many companies will be adversely affected by any slowdown inthe availability of freight transportation, the negative impact could affect our businessdisproportionately. For example, we offer specialized services that guarantee on-time delivery. Ifthe new security measures disrupt the timing of deliveries, we could fail to meet the needs of ourcustomers or could incur increased costs in order to do so.We operate in a highly competitive industry and our business could suffer if our operatingsubsidiaries were unable to adequately address downward pricing pressures and other factors thatcould adversely affect their ability to compete with other companies.Numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability. Thesefactors include:We compete with many other LTL carriers of varying sizes, including both union and nonunion LTLcarriers and, to a lesser extent, with truckload carriers and railroads.Our nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure for their freight-handling anddriving personnel than union carriers. However, we believe that we have lower turnover rates andhigher labor efficiency rates than some of our competitors. Our competitors could reduce theirfreight rates to gain market share, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy.This could limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates, maintain our operating marginsor grow tonnage levels.The trend toward consolidation in the transportation industry could continue to create larger LTLcarriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size.We could experience some difficulty if the remaining LTL carriers, in fact, have a competitiveadvantage because of their size.Our new service and growth initiatives may not be accepted by our customers.Our continuing development of more second-day service lanes, overnight lanes and same-day servicewill require ongoing investment in personnel and infrastructure. In addition, the level of revenuesexpected to be generated from these service initiatives may be impacted by actions of ourcompetitors. Depending on the timing and level of revenues generated from these serviceinitiatives, our results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.We depend heavily on the availability of fuel for our trucks. Fuel shortages, increases in fuelcosts and the inability to collect fuel surcharges or obtain sufficient fuel supplies could have amaterial adverse effect on our operating results.Fuel prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. However, consistent with industrypractice, we charge a fuel surcharge based on changes in diesel fuel prices compared to a nationalindex. Customer acceptance of the fuel surcharges has been good; however, we cannot be certain thatcollection of fuel surcharges will continue in the future. Although fuel costs increasedsignificantly in recent years, increased revenues from diesel fuel surcharges more than offsetthese higher diesel fuel costs. We have experienced cost increases in other operating costs as aresult of increased fuel prices. However, the total impact of higher energy prices on othernon-fuel-related expenses is difficult to ascertain. As diesel fuel prices decline, the fuelsurcharge and associated direct diesel fuel costs also decline by different degrees. Depending uponthe rates of these declines and the impact on costs in other fuel and energy-related areas,operating margins could be negatively impacted. However, lower fuel surcharge levels may, overtime, improve ABFs ability to increase other elements of margin, since the total price is governedby marketforces, although there can be no assurances in this regard. We do not have any long-term11Table of Contentsfuelpurchase contracts and have not entered into any hedging arrangements to protect against fuel priceincreases. Significant changes in diesel fuel prices and the associated fuel surcharge may increasevolatility in our reported revenues. Volatile fuel prices will continue to impact our results ofoperations.We depend on transportation provided by rail services and a disruption of this service couldadversely affect our operations.In 2006, ABFs rail utilization was 15.5% of total miles. If a disruption in transportationservices from the rail service providers occurred, we could be faced with business interruptionsthat could cause us to fail to meet the needs of our customers. If these situations occurred, ourresults of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect profitability if we were unableto generate sufficient cash from operations.We have significant ongoing capital requirements. If we were not able to generate sufficient cashfrom operations in the future, our growth could be limited, we could have to utilize our existingfinancing arrangements to a greater extent or enter into additional leasing arrangements, or ourrevenue equipment may have to be held for longer periods, which would result in increasedmaintenance costs. If these situations occurred, there could be an adverse effect on ourprofitability.Increased prices for new revenue equipment and decreases in the value of used revenue equipmentcould adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.Manufacturers have raised the prices of new equipment significantly, in part, to offset their costsof compliance with new EPA tractor engine design requirements intended to reduce emissions. Theinitial requirements took effect October 1, 2002, and more restrictive EPA engine designrequirements became effective on January 1, 2007. Further equipment price increases may result fromthese requirements. If new equipment prices increase more than anticipated, we could incur higherdepreciation and rental expenses than anticipated. If we were unable to offset any such increasesin expenses with freight rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Ifthe market value of revenue equipment being used in our operations were to decrease, we could incurimpairment losses and our cash flows could be adversely affected.The engines used in our newer tractors are subject to new emissions-control regulations, whichcould substantially increase operating expenses.Tractor engines that comply with the EPA emission-control design requirements that took effect onJanuary 1, 2007 are generally less fuel-efficient and may result in increased maintenance coststhan engines in tractors manufactured before these requirements became effective. If we are unableto offset resulting increases in fuel expenses or maintenance costs with higher freight rates, ourresults of operations could be adversely affected.Decreases in the availability of new tractors and trailers could have a material adverse effect onour operating results.From time to time, some tractor and trailer vendors have reduced their manufacturing output due,for example, to lower demand for their products in economic downturns or a shortage of componentparts. As conditions changed, some of those vendors have had difficulty fulfilling any increaseddemand for new equipment. Also, vendors must meet the new EPA emission-control design requirementsthat took effect on January 1, 2007, possibly leading totractor shortages. An inability to continue to obtain an adequate supply of new tractors ortrailers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.12Table of ContentsOngoing claims expenses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Our self-insurance retention levels are currently $1.0 million for each workers compensation loss,$1.0 million for each cargo loss and generally $1.0 million for each third-party casualty loss. Formedical benefits, we self-insure up to $150,000 per person, per claim year. We maintain insurancefor liabilities above the amounts of self-insurance to certain limits. If the frequency and/orseverity of claims increase, our operating results could be adversely affected. The timing of theincurrence of these costs could significantly and adversely impact our operating results comparedto prior periods. In addition, if we were to lose our ability to self-insure for any significantperiod of time, insurance costs could materially increase and we could experience difficulty inobtaining adequate levels of insurance coverage in that event.Increased insurance premium costs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.In the last several years, insurance carriers have increased premiums for many companies, includingtransportation companies. We could experience additional increases in our insurance premiums in thefuture. If our insurance or claims expenses increase and we were unable to offset the increase withhigher freight rates, our earnings could be adversely affected.We operate in a highly regulated industry and costs of compliance with, or liability for violationsof, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Various federal and state agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportationbusiness, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrieroperations, safety, insurance requirements and financial reporting. We could also become subject tonew or more restrictive regulations, such as regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers hoursof service or ergonomics. Compliance with such regulations could substantially reduce equipmentproductivity, and the costs of compliance could increase our operating expenses.On August 19, 2005, the DOT issued new rules regulating work and sleep schedules for commercialtruck drivers. The new rules replaced Hours-of-Service Regulations that were last updated in 2003.The new rules, which were effective October 1, 2005, have had a minimal impact upon our operations.However, future changes in these rules could materially and adversely affect our operatingefficiency and increase costs.Our drivers and dockworkers also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated bythe DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service. TheTransportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has adoptedregulations that will require all drivers who carry hazardous materials to undergo backgroundchecks by the Federal Bureau of Investigation when they obtain or renew their licenses.Failures to comply with DOT safety regulations or downgrades in our safety rating could have amaterial adverse impact on our operations or financial condition. A downgrade in our safety ratingcould cause us to lose the ability to self-insure. The loss of our ability to self-insure for anysignificant period of time could materially increase insurance costs. In addition, we couldexperience difficulty in obtaining adequate levels of coverage in that event.Increases in license and registration fees could also have an adverse effect on our operatingresults.We depend on our employees to support our operating business and future growth opportunities. Ifour relationship with our employees were to deteriorate, we could be faced with labor disruptionsor stoppages,which could have a material adverse affect on our business and reduce our operating results andplace us at a disadvantage relative to nonunion competitors.13Table of ContentsMost of ABFs union employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement with the IBT.This agreement expires in March 2008. Negotiations on a new agreement are expected to begin priorto March 2008. If an agreement is not reached before the expiration of the current agreement, wecould be faced with a union workforce disruption or stoppage and, as a result, our results ofoperations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.We compete against both union and nonunion LTL carriers. Union companies typically have somewhathigher wage costs and significantly higher fringe benefit costs than nonunion companies. Unioncompanies typically experience lower employee turnover and higher productivity compared to somenonunion companies. Due to our national reputation, our working conditions and wages and benefits,we have not historically experienced any significant long-term difficulty in attracting orretaining qualified drivers, although short-term difficulties have been encountered in certainsituations, such as periods of significant increases in tonnage levels. Difficulty in attractingand retaining qualified drivers or increases in compensation or fringe benefit costs could affectour profitability and our ability to grow. If we were unable to continue to attract and retainqualified drivers, we could incur higher driver recruiting expenses or a loss of business.We could be obligated to make significant payments to cover withdrawal liabilities to multiemployerpension plans if we were to cease making our contractual monthly contributions to those plans. Inaddition, if a plan were found to have a funding deficiency under federal tax law, we would berequired to make additional contributions to that plan to avoid excise taxes related to the fundingdeficiency.Retirement and health care benefits for ABFs contractual employees are provided by a number ofmultiemployer plans, under the provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act. The multiemployer pension plansand their related trust funds are administered by trustees, an equal number of whom generally areappointed by the IBT and certain management carrier organizations or other appointing authoritiesfor employer trustees as set forth in the funds trust agreements. We are not directly involved inthe administration of the multiemployer pension plans or their related trust funds. We contributeto these plans monthly based on the hours worked by our contractual employees, as specified in theNational Master Freight Agreement and other supporting supplemental agreements. Approximately 50%of our contributions are made to the Central States Southeast and Southwest Area Pension Fund(Central States). No amounts are required to be paid beyond our monthly contractual obligationsbased on the hours worked by our employees, except as discussed below. Significant increases inrequired contributions to the multiemployer plans could adversely impact our liquidity and resultsof operations.We have contingent liabilities for our share of the unfunded liabilities of each multiemployerpension plan to which ABF contributes. Our contingent liability for a plan would become payable ifwe were to withdraw from that plan. We have gathered data from the majority of these plans andcurrently estimate our total contingent withdrawal liabilities for these pension plans to beapproximately $600 to $650 million on a pre-tax basis. The increase over the prior year withdrawalliability estimate primarily reflects changes in mortality assumptions used by the Central Statesplan. Though the best information available to us was used in computing this estimate, it iscalculated with numerous assumptions, is not current and is continually changing. The fundingstatus of these plans also may be impacted by investment returns as well as the number ofparticipating employees, the number of employers who contribute and their related contributionamounts and the number of employees or retirees participating in the plans who no longer have acontributing employer. If we did incur withdrawal liabilities, those amounts would generally bepayable over a period of 10 to 15 years.Aside from the withdrawal liabilities, we would only have an obligation to pay an amount beyondABFs contractual obligations to these pension plans if we received official notification of afunding deficiency. ABF has not received notification of a funding deficiency for any of the plansto which it contributes. The amount of anypotential funding deficiency, if it were to materialize in the future, should be substantially lessthan the full withdrawal liability for each pension plan.14Table of ContentsIn August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Act) became law. The Act mandates thatmultiemployer plans that are below certain funding levels adopt a rehabilitation program to improvethe funding levels over a defined period of time. Based on currently available information, webelieve that a number of plans in which the Company participates, including Central States, may bebelow the required funding levels when the Act becomes effective in 2008 and therefore would haveto adopt rehabilitation programs for future plan years. However, the funding levels of thesemultiemployer plans in 2008 could vary from the current funding status. The Act preserves theInternal Revenue Service ten-year extension, previously received by Central States, of the periodover which unfunded liabilities are amortized. Information to determine the actual impact the Actwill have on the Company is not available at this time.Under the current IBT collective bargaining agreement, which extends through March 31, 2008 asdescribed above, ABF is obligated to continue contributions to the multiemployer pension plans. Weintend to meet our obligations under the agreement. Contract negotiations for periods subsequent toMarch 31, 2008 are expected to begin later in 2007. The financial condition of the plans, theeffect of the Pension Protection Act of 2006 on the plans, and the methodology (includingparticipation in the plans) and level of ABFs funding required to provide retirement benefits forits union employees, will all be significant matters to be addressed in the contract negotiations.Because of uncertainties regarding these negotiations and the financial condition of the plans,either changes in our funding methodologies as a result of the negotiations or continuedparticipation could have a material impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results ofoperations.Our information technology systems are subject to certain risks that are beyond our control.We depend on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems in operating ourbusiness. These systems include our communications and data processing systems. Our informationsystems are protected through physical and software safeguards.
