Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise could have a significant effect on the airline industry. In order to address aircraft carbon dioxide emissions, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations specialized agency, formally adopted a global, market-based emission offset program known as CORSIA. This program establishes a goal for the aviation industry to achieve carbon-neutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021 through the use of carbon offsets and/or lower carbon aviation fuel. ICAO set the baseline for establishing airlines’ obligations under CORSIA for 2021 to 2023 based on 2019 travel, and in 2022 set a new, more stringent CORSIA baseline of 85% of 2019, which will apply from 2024 through 2035. Because certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the initial phases of the program, the impact of CORSIA cannot be predicted at this time. However, CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally. In addition to CORSIA, we may face a patchwork of regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad and could become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions. For example, in 2023, the EU adopted updated legislation on the EU Emissions Trading System (“ETS”). The new legislation continues in effect the so-called “stop-the-clock” provision whereby EU ETS does not apply to flights to or from locations outside the EEA, Switzerland or the UK until 2027. However, the legislation provides for a review of the effectiveness of CORSIA in 2026 that could, if CORSIA is not deemed sufficiently effective, lead to the application of EU ETS to all flights departing the EU and EEA. Also in 2023, the EU adopted legislation that will impose a SAF mandate on fuel supplied at EU airports. The mandate initially requires that, of the jet fuel supplied in the EU, 2% must be SAF beginning in 2025, and the percentage increases incrementally over time to 70% in 2050. This mandate is expected to increase the cost of SAF in the EU. Additional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for the airline industry, including Delta. In addition to direct costs, such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations. While the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict, new laws or regulations related to environmental matters adopted in the U.S. or other countries could impose significant additional costs on or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Certain airports have also adopted, and others could in the future adopt, greenhouse gas emission or climate-related goals and requirements that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or investments in our infrastructure.In addition to risks from potential changes to environmental regulation and policy, the transition to lower-carbon technologies, such as SAF, or changes in consumer preferences resulting from a negative perception of the environmental impact of air travel could materially adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, lower-carbon technologies such as SAF and direct air capture technologies are currently not available at scale and may take decades to develop, and the cost to transition to them could be prohibitively expensive without appropriate government policies and incentives in place.Because of the global nature of our business, unfavorable economic or political conditions in the markets in which we operate or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, our business is subject to economic and political conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the economy in the U.S. or abroad, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business using technological alternatives. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations.Our international operations are an important part of our route network. Political disruptions and instability around the world can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel. Additionally, any deterioration in global trade relations, such as increased tariffs or other trade barriers, could result in a decrease in the demand for international air travel"

The airline industry is subject to many forms of environmental regulation, including increased regulation to reduce emissions and other risks associated with climate change. Failure to comply with existing or future environmental regulations or to otherwise manage the risks of climate change effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.Many aspects of our operations are subject to evolving and increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws governing the protection of the environment. Compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations could require capital investment and increase operational costs, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties and reputational harm.Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. In order to address aircraft carbon dioxide emissions, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations specialized agency, formally adopted a global, market-based emission offset program known as CORSIA. This program establishes a medium-term goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbon-neutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021, based on a 2019 baseline. Certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program, and thus the impact of CORSIA cannot be fully predicted at this time.

 Relating to DeltaWe are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners.An aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare, alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business.Breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.As a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including information necessary for our operations, personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Our information systems and those of our service providers are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information, or those of our service providers, including through fraud or other means of deception. Hardware or software we develop, acquire or use in connection with our systems may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. For example, we were notified in 2018 that a third-party vendor of chat services for Delta and other companies determined it had been involved in a cyber incident for a short period in 2017. We have incurred remedial, legal and other costs in connection with this incident but the costs are not material to our financial position or results of operations.The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. As a result of these types of risks and regular attacks on our systems, we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data. In addition to continuously risk assessing and reviewing our procedures, processes and technologies, we also continue to monitor, review and update the process and control requirements we expect our third parties and vendors to leverage and implement for the protection of Delta information that is in their care. However, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all information security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, our information or that of our customers, employees or business partners or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. The costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material. In addition, as cybercriminals become more sophisticated, the cost of proactive defensive measures may increase.13Disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.Disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. The operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our network, including third-party networks we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. While we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans (including the creation of a back-up data center) and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans, these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and any material adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.Failure of our technology to perform effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, application of biometric technology, airport information displays and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. We are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems. The performance, reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers. If our technology does not perform effectively, our business and operations would be negatively affected, which could be material.Our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.An important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers, including through joint ventures. We expect to continue exploring ways to expand our relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy. These investments and relationships involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment or that they may not generate the expected financial results. These events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.In addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. While we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. To the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period or their actions have a significant adverse effect on our operations, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In certain circumstances, we also may be subject to consequences of the failure of these carriers to comply with laws and regulations, including U.S. laws to which they may be subject. For example, we may be subject to consequences from improper behavior of our joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Such a result could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements, include financial and other covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default.Our primary credit facility has various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a minimum asset coverage ratio. We have other smaller facilities, some of which are secured and also contain collateral coverage ratios. A decline in the value of our assets supporting these facilities from factors that are not under our control could affect one or more of the ratios. In addition, the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result.14The credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable and where applicable, repossess collateral, which may include aircraft or other valuable assets. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. The acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate, repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements.Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may have a material adverse effect on our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 19% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. The collective bargaining agreement with our pilots became amendable on December 31, 2019 and we are in discussions with representatives of the pilots regarding terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the NLRA, which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.If we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third-party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Our results of operations are impacted by severe weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters (or other environmental events) can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in our international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. An extended disruption in services provided by third parties, including third-party regional carriers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third-party carriers in the Delta Connection program and ground operations at some airports. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. In particular, some third-party regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines. If this shortage becomes more widespread, third-party regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us. To the extent that a significant disruption in services occurs because third party providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased, resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.15Our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Over the last decade, fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile. In 2019, our average fuel price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedges, was $2.02, an 8.2% decrease from our average fuel price in 2018. In 2018, our average fuel price per gallon was $2.20, a 31.0% increase from our average fuel price in 2017 of $1.68. Fuel costs represented 21.1%, 23.0% and 19.2% of our operating expense in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary, Monroe, and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with third parties. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.The competitive nature of the airline industry may affect our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers. In addition, because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase. At times in the past, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs, and we may not be able to do so in the future.Significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from Monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or taxes, changes in refining capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.Because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.If Monroe's cost of producing non-jet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.An environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the Monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results if insurance is unable to cover a significant liability. In addition, such an incident could damage our reputation.Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities, and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position. In addition, because of our ownership of Monroe, the occurrence of an environmental or other incident could result in damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.16The operation of the refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. Monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. In addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for Monroe or restrict its operations. In particular, under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has adopted RFS that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into Transportation Fuels. RINs are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs.Because Monroe blends only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. As a result, Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Market prices for RINs have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. Purchasing RINs at elevated prices could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.Existing laws or regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.If we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.Our reputation and brand could be damaged if we are exposed to significant adverse publicity.We operate in a highly visible, public environment with significant exposure to traditional and social media. Adverse publicity, whether justified or not, can rapidly spread, including through social or digital media. In particular, passengers can use social media to provide feedback about their interaction with us in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent we are unable to respond timely and appropriately to adverse publicity, our brand and reputation may be damaged. Significant damage to our overall reputation and brand image could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. 17Risk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryTerrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of any of these events, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. Despite significant security measures at airports and airlines, the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups. We constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals, including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically, with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry. In addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. Security events, primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats, also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations. These events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of any of these events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying, leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds. In addition, potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring, reputational harm and other costs. If any or all of these types of events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and loyalty programs. Consolidation in the airline industry, the rise of subsidized government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures.Our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and other discount or ultra low-cost carriers, including Spirit Airlines, Frontier Airlines and Allegiant Air, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. Point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hubs and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Competition from government-owned and subsidized carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, is significant. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and have increased service to the U.S. These carriers are government-subsidized, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines.Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In addition, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.18Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate or the extended grounding of a type of aircraft or engine we operate could have a material adverse effect on our operations.The airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the United States and throughout the world. An extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the airline industry is heavily dependent on a limited number of aircraft and engine manufacturers whose products are subject to extensive regulatory requirements. The long-term grounding of an aircraft or engine type that we operate could have a significant impact on our operations if we are not able to substitute or replace the affected aircraft or engine type and could, in any event, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations. Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. Additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations. Airport slot access is subject to government regulation and changes in slot regulations or allocations could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in airports subject to such regulations or allocations. In addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. As an international carrier, we are subject to a wide variety of U.S. and foreign laws that affect trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. On October 2, 2019, an arbitration tribunal of the World Trade Organization ruled in a long-standing dispute that the United States could impose $7.5 billion in retaliatory tariffs in response to European Union subsidies to Airbus. Effective October 18, 2019, the U.S. Trade Representative imposed tariffs on certain products imported from the European Union, including an ad valorem duty of 10% on commercial aircraft originating in France and Germany. Some of the Airbus aircraft that we have on order would be subject to these tariffs if imported as new aircraft. We are pursuing strategies to minimize the impact of these tariffs on our aircraft deliveries but if we are unsuccessful or if the tariffs are increased, these tariffs could substantially increase the cost to us of the affected aircraft, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, some of our operations are in high-risk legal compliance environments. Failure to comply with trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws or regulations could result in litigation, assessment of damages, imposition of penalties or other consequences, any or all of which could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial results.We and other U.S. carriers are subject to U.S. and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the U.S., certain European government agencies have recently updated privacy regulations applicable to private industry, including airlines. Ongoing compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and any future expansion. 19The airline industry is subject to many forms of environmental regulation, including increased regulation to reduce emissions. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Many aspects of our operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international laws governing the protection of the environment. Compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties. Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. In order to address aircraft emissions, ICAO, a UN specialized agency, formally adopted a global, market-based emission offset program known as CORSIA. This program establishes a medium-term goal for the aviation industry of achieving carbon-neutral growth in international aviation beginning in 2021, based on a 2019-2020 baseline. Certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program, and thus the impact of CORSIA cannot be fully predicted. However, CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally. In addition to CORSIA, we may face additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad and become subject to further taxes, charges or additional requirements to obtain permits or purchase allowances or emission credits for greenhouse gas emissions in various jurisdictions. Additional regulation could result in taxation, regulatory or permitting requirements from multiple jurisdictions for the same operations and significant costs for us and the airline industry. In addition to direct costs, such regulation could result in increased fuel costs passed through from fuel suppliers affected by any such regulations. While the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict, new laws or regulations related to environmental matters adopted in the U.S. or other countries could impose significant additional costs on our operations.Because of the global nature of our business, unfavorable global economic conditions or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, with approximately 30% of our revenues from operations outside of the U.S., our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business using technological alternatives. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations.Economic conditions following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business.Following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the U.K. approved an exit (often referred to as Brexit) from the European Union, the U.K.’s withdrawal became effective on January 31, 2020. A transition period will apply until the end of 2020 (or later, if extended) during which the pre-Brexit legal regime will continue to apply (including with respect to aviation) while the U.K. and European Union negotiate rules that will apply to their future relationship. It is unknown how that future relationship will be structured. Regardless of what happens between the U.K. and European Union, the U.S. - European Union Open Skies air services agreement will continue to apply to air services between the U.S. and the European Union and a new U.S.-U.K. Open Skies agreement will apply to air services between the U.S. and the U.K.Currently, it is uncertain what will be the terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union on matters such as trade, customs, financial services and the movement of goods and people. Furthermore, post-Brexit ambiguity or changes in regulations could diminish the value of route authorities, slots or other assets owned by us or our joint venture partners and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and financial condition.20The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness such as a novel coronavirus, or fear of such an event, can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As a result of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, we have temporarily ceased operations in China and the continued spread of the virus could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for air travel and, as a result, our financial results. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations"
9,DAL,DELTA AIR LINES INC,2019-02-15,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Factors
 Relating to DeltaOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Over the last decade, fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile. In 2018, our average fuel price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedges, was $2.20, a 31.0% increase from our average fuel price in 2017. In 2017, our average fuel price per gallon was $1.68, a 12.8% increase from our average fuel price in 2016. In 2016, our average fuel price per gallon was $1.49, a 21.6% decrease from our average fuel price in 2015. Fuel costs represented 23.0%, 19.2% and 18.3% of our operating expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. In addition, because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase. At times in the past, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs, and we may not be able to do so in the future. We acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary, Monroe, and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with third parties. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.Significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from Monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation, taxes or marketing, changes in refining capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.Because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.If Monroe's cost of producing non-jet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. The effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and mark-to-market adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results.To the extent that we may reduce the financial impact of changes in the price of jet fuel through a hedging program, we may utilize different contract and commodity types in the program and test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. Any hedging program may not be successful in providing price protection due to market conditions and the choice of hedging instruments. We closely monitor any hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates. In addition, we record mark-to-market adjustments (""MTM adjustments"") on our fuel hedges. MTM adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. Losses from rebalancing or MTM adjustments (or both) may have a negative impact on our financial results. 12Our fuel hedge contracts may contain margin funding requirements, which require us to post margin to counterparties or cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. If fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.An important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers. We expect to continue exploring ways to expand our relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy. These investments and relationships involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. These events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.In addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. While we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. To the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations or adversely affect our operations, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We also may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners.An aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare, alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business.Breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.As a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Our information systems and those of our service providers are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information or those of our service providers, including through fraud or other means of deception. Hardware or software we develop, acquire or use in connection with our systems may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. We were notified in 2018 that a third-party vendor of chat services for Delta and other companies determined it had been involved in a cyber incident for a short period in 2017. We have incurred remedial, legal and other costs in connection with this incident but the costs are not material to our financial position or results of operations.The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. As a result of these types of risks and regular attacks on our systems, we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data. In addition to continuously risk assessing and reviewing our procedures, processes and technologies, we also continue to monitor, review and update the process and control requirements we expect our third parties and vendors to leverage and implement for the protection of Delta information that is in their care. However, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data.  13The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, customers', employees' or business partners' information or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business. The costs to remediate breaches and similar system compromises that do occur could be material. In addition, as cybercriminals become more sophisticated, the cost of proactive defensive measures may increase.Disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.Disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. For example, we experienced a power outage at our data center in 2016 that disrupted our operations even though it was quickly addressed. The operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our network, including third-party networks we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. While we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans (including the creation of a back-up data center since 2016) and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans, these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.Failure of our technology to perform effectively could have an adverse effect on our business. We are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, application of biometric technology, airport information displays and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. We are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems. The performance, reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers. If our technology does not perform effectively, our business and operations would be negatively affected, which could be material.Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements, include financial and other covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default.Our primary credit facility has various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratios and a minimum asset coverage ratio. We have other smaller facilities, some of which are secured and also contain collateral coverage ratios. A decline in the value of our assets supporting these facilities from factors that are not under our control could affect one or more of the ratios. In addition, the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result.The credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. The acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate, repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements.Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 19% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the NLRA, which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires. 14If we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third-party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.Our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Our results of operations are impacted by severe weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters (or other environmental events) can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in our international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. An extended disruption in services provided by third parties, including third-party regional carriers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third-party carriers in the Delta Connection program and ground operations at some airports. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. In particular, some third-party regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines. If this shortage becomes more widespread, third-party regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us. To the extent that a significant disruption in services occurs because third party providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased, resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the Monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities, and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position. The operation of the refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. Monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for Monroe or restrict its operations.  15In particular, under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has adopted RFS that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into Transportation Fuels. RINs are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs.Because Monroe blends only a small amount of renewable fuels, it must purchase the majority of its RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. As a result, Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Market prices for RINs have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. Purchasing RINs at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.Existing laws or regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.If we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.Our reputation and brand could be damaged if we are exposed to significant adverse publicity through social media.We operate in a highly visible, public environment with significant exposure to social media. Adverse publicity, whether justified or not, can rapidly spread through social or digital media. In particular, passengers can use social media to provide feedback about their interaction with us in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent we are unable to respond timely and appropriately to adverse publicity, our brand and reputation may be damaged. Significant damage to our overall reputation and brand image could have a negative impact on our financial results.  16Risk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryTerrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of any of these events, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. Despite significant security measures at airports and airlines, the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups. We constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals, including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically, with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry. In addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. Security events, primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats, also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations. These events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of any of these events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying, leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds. In addition, potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring, reputational harm and other costs. If any or all of these types of events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and loyalty programs. Consolidation in the airline industry, the rise of subsidized government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures.Our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and other discount or ultra low-cost carriers, including Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. Point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hub and key airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and key airports. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Competition from government-owned and subsidized carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways, is significant. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and have increased service to the U.S. These carriers are government-subsidized, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines.Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In addition, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 17Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations.The airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the United States and throughout the world. An extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations. Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. Additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations. Airport slot access is subject to government regulation and changes in slot regulations or allocations could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in airports subject to such regulations or allocations. In addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. While the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict, new environmental laws or regulations adopted in the U.S. or other countries could impose significant additional costs on our operations, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs that our suppliers pass along to us.We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the U.S., certain European government agencies have recently updated privacy regulations applicable to private industry, including airlines. Ongoing compliance with these evolving regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion. Because of the global nature of our business, unfavorable global economic conditions or volatility in currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, with approximately 30% of our revenues from operations outside of the U.S., our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations. 18Economic conditions following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.Following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union (often referred to as Brexit), the U.K.’s withdrawal is scheduled to become effective March 29, 2019 but there is substantial uncertainty regarding the terms of the withdrawal. Regardless of what happens with Brexit, the U.S.-EU Open Skies air services agreement will remain in effect and the recently signed U.S.-U.K. Open Skies agreement will take effect, maintaining the current liberal air services regime in the transatlantic market. The imposition of restrictions on flying rights between the EU and U.K. in connection with Brexit could negatively impact Virgin Atlantic, our joint venture partner in which we have 49% ownership, and could impact the planned integration of our transatlantic joint ventures.The exit of the U.K. from the EU without agreement on matters such as trade, customs, financial services and the movement of goods and people between the EU and the U.K. could adversely impact the demand for air travel in the U.K. and increase costs for us and our joint venture partners. Furthermore, post-Brexit ambiguity or changes in regulations could diminish the value of route authorities, slots or other assets owned by us or our joint venture partners and, therefore, could adversely impact on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness, or fear of such an event, can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations"

 Relating to DeltaOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Over the last decade, fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile during the last several years. In 2017, our average fuel price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedges, was $1.68, a 12.8% increase from our average fuel price in 2016. In 2016, our average fuel price per gallon was $1.49, a 21.6% decrease from our average fuel price in 2015. In 2015, our average fuel price per gallon was $1.90, a 45.2% decrease from our average fuel price in 2014. Fuel costs represented 19.2%, 18.3% and 23.0% of our operating expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. Because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase. At times in the past, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs, and we may not be able to do so in the future. We acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary, Monroe, and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with third parties. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.Fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. The effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and mark-to-market adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results.We have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of fuel as fuel prices are subject to potential volatility. We may utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. We closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates. Our hedging program may not be successful in providing price protection due to market conditions and the choice of hedging instruments. In addition, we record mark-to-market adjustments (""MTM adjustments"") on our fuel hedges. MTM adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. Losses from rebalancing or MTM adjustments (or both) may have a negative impact on our financial results.Our fuel hedge contracts may contain margin funding requirements, which require us to post margin to counterparties or cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. If fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from Monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation, taxes or marketing, changes in refining capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. 12Table of ContentsBecause we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.If Monroe's cost of producing non-jet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.An important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers. We expect to continue exploring ways to expand our relationships with other carriers as part of our global business strategy. These investments and relationships involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. These events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.In addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. While we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. To the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations, our results of operations may be adversely affected. We also may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft or aircraft of our airline partners.An aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare, alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business.Breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.As a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy.  13Table of ContentsOur information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information, including through fraud or other means of deception. Hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. As a result of these types of risks and regular attacks, we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data. However, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, customers', employees' or business partners' information or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business.Disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.Disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. The operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our network, including third-party networks we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. While we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans, these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.Failure of our technology to perform effectively could have an adverse effect on our business. We are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in customer facing technology such as delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, airport information displays and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. We are also investing in significant upgrades to technology infrastructure and other supporting systems. The performance, reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers. If our technology does not perform effectively, our business and operations would be negatively affected, which could be material.Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements, include financial and other covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default.Our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures. These changes could result from factors that are not under our control. A decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where it may be difficult to maintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. The credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. The acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate, repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements. 14Table of ContentsEmployee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 19% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the NLRA, which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.If we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third-party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.Our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Our results of operations are impacted by severe weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters (or other environmental events) can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. An extended disruption in services provided by third parties, including third-party regional carriers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third-party carriers in the Delta Connection program. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. In particular, some third-party regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines. If this shortage becomes more widespread, third-party regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us. To the extent that a significant disruption in services occurs because third party providers, including regional carriers, are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 15Table of ContentsThe failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the Monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities, and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position. The operation of the refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. Monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for Monroe or restrict its operations. In particular, under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has adopted RFS that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into Transportation Fuels. RINs are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs.Because the refinery operated by Monroe does not blend renewable fuels, it must purchase its RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. As a result, Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Market prices for RINs have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases and decreases. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. Purchasing RINs at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.Existing laws or regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.If we lose senior management and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.Our reputation and brand could be damaged if we are exposed to significant adverse publicity through social media.We operate in a highly visible, public environment with significant exposure to social media. Adverse publicity, whether justified or not, can rapidly spread through social or digital media. In particular, passengers can use social media to provide feedback about their interaction with us in a manner that can be quickly and broadly disseminated. To the extent we are unable to respond timely and appropriately to adverse publicity, our brand and reputation may be damaged. Significant damage to our overall reputation and brand image could have a negative impact on our financial results.  16Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryTerrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of such events, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. Despite significant security measures at airports and airlines, the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups. We constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals, including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically, with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry. In addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. Security events, primarily from external sources but also from potential insider threats, also pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations. These events could include random acts of violence and could occur in public areas that we cannot control.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of such events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying, leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds. In addition, potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring, reputational harm and other costs. If any or all of these types of events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. Consolidation in the airline industry, the rise of well-funded government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures.Our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. Point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers, including Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air, place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. As a result, we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Competition is significant from government-owned and -funded carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the U.S. from their hubs in the Middle East. Several of these carriers, along with carriers from China, India and Southeast Asia, are government-subsidized, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In addition, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 17Table of ContentsExtended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports in which we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations.The airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the United States and throughout the world. An extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring significant expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations. Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. Additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations. Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace, particularly in the Northeast U.S., have included concepts such as ""congestion-based"" landing fees, ""slot auctions"" or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. In addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. While the specific nature of future actions is hard to predict, new environmental laws or regulations adopted in the U.S. or other countries could impose significant additional costs on our operations, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs that our suppliers pass along to us.We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the U.S., certain European government agencies are reviewing airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion. Prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, with approximately 30% of our revenues from operations outside of the U.S., our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations. 18Table of ContentsEconomic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union (""EU""), theU.K. government has initiated a process to leave the EU (often referred to as Brexit) and begun negotiating the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU. The airline industry faces substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the exit of the U.K. from the EU. Adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation of the airline industry or bilateral agreements governing air travel could have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness, or fear of such an event, can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations"

 Relating to DeltaTerrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of such events, could have a significant adverse effect on our business. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the aftermath materially impacted the business, financial condition and operating results of our company, as it did for the rest of the airline industry. Despite significantly heightened security measures at airports and airlines, the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups. We constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals, including from violent extremists both internationally and domestically, both with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry. In addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. Security events, whether from external or internal sources, also pose a significant risk to our operations. These events can include random acts of violence and can occur in public areas that we cannot control.  Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of such events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying leading to decreased ticket sales and increased refunds. In addition, potential costs from these types of events include increased security costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring, reputational harm and other costs. If any or all of these types of events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Over the last decade, fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile during the last several years. In 2016, our average fuel price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedges, was $1.49, a 21.6% decrease from our average fuel price in 2015. In 2015, our average fuel price per gallon was $1.90, a 45.2% decrease from our average fuel price in 2014. In 2014, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.47, which was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier. Fuel costs represented 18.3%, 23.0% and 35.4% of our operating expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. At times in the past, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs, and we may not be able to do so in the future. Because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase.We acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly owned subsidiary, Monroe, and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with third parties. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.Fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. The effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and mark-to-market adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results.We have recently managed our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel as jet fuel prices are subject to potential volatility. We utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. We closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates. Our hedging program may not be successful in providing price protection due to market conditions and the choice of hedging instruments. In addition, we record mark-to-market adjustments (""MTM adjustments"") on our fuel hedges. MTM adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. Losses from rebalancing or MTM adjustments (or both) may have a negative impact on our financial results. 12Table of ContentsOur fuel hedge contracts typically contain margin funding requirements. The margin funding requirements may require us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. If fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from Monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation, taxes or marketing, changes in refining capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.Because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.If Monroe's cost of producing non-jet fuel products exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.An important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers. We expect to continue exploring similar non-controlling investments in, and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances with, other carriers as part of our global business strategy. These investments involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. These events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.In addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. While we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. We may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. To the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft.An aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare, alliance or joint venture partners could create a negative public perception about safety, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business. 13Table of ContentsAgreements governing our debt, including credit agreements, include financial and other covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default.Our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures. These changes could result from factors that are not under our control. A decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where it may be difficult to maintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. The credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. The acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate, repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements.Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 19% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the NLRA, which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.If we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third-party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub, gateway or key airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our other hub, gateway or key airports, including Amsterdam, Boston, Detroit, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City, Seattle and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to other major cities and to other Delta hubs and gateways. A significant extended interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs, gateways or other key airports could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Breaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.As a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy.  14Table of ContentsOur information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deception. Hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. As a result of these types of risks, we regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data. However, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, customers', employees' or business partners' information or failure to comply with regulatory or contractual obligations with respect to such information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business.Disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.Disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. The operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our network, including third-party networks we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. While we have in place initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans and continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans, these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.Failure of our technology to perform reliably could have an adverse effect on our business. We are dependent on technology initiatives to provide customer service and operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks, customer service applications, airport information displays and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. The performance, reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to serve customers. If our technology does not perform reliably, our business and operations would be negatively affected, which could be material.Our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Our results of operations are impacted by severe weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters (or other environmental events) can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.  15Table of ContentsAn extended disruption in services provided by our third-party regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third-party carriers in the Delta Connection program. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. In particular, some third-party regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines. If this shortage becomes more widespread, third-party regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us. To the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the Monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities, and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position. The operation of the refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. Monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for Monroe or restrict its operations. In particular, under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has adopted RFS that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into Transportation Fuels. RINs are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs.Because the refinery operated by Monroe does not blend renewable fuels, it must purchase its RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. As a result, Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Market prices for RINs have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. Purchasing RINs at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.Existing laws or regulations could change, and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.If we lose senior management personnel and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future. 16Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. Consolidation in the airline industry, the rise of well-funded government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry, resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures.Our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. Point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers, including Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air, place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. As a result, we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Competition is increasing from government-owned and -funded carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the U.S. from their hubs in the Middle East. Several of these carriers, along with carriers from China, India and Southeast Asia, are government-subsidized, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In addition, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations. Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. Additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations.  17Table of ContentsProposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace, particularly in the Northeast U.S., have included concepts such as ""congestion-based"" landing fees, ""slot auctions"" or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. In addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. For example, the European Commission adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union, including flights to and from the U.S. While enforcement of the scheme has been deferred until 2017, we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the European Union if fully implemented. Other environmental laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system. We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the U.S., certain European government agencies are reviewing airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion. Prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, with approximately 30% of our revenues from operations outside of the U.S., our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations.Economic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union (""EU""), the U.K. government is expected to initiate a process to leave the EU (often referred to as Brexit) and begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU. The airline industry faces substantial uncertainty regarding the impact of the likely exit of the U.K. from the EU. Adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation of the airline industry or bilateral agreements governing air travel could have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness, or fear of such an event, can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we have significant operations may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 18Table of Contents"
6,DAL,DELTA AIR LINES INC,2016-02-05,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Factors
 Relating to DeltaTerrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Potential terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of such events, may reduce demand for air travel and cause increases in costs and declines in revenue. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the aftermath materially impacted the business, financial condition and operating results of our company, as it did for the rest of the airline industry. Despite significantly heightened security measures at airports and airlines, the airline industry remains a high profile target for terrorist groups. Terrorist activity, such as the attacks in Paris in November 2015, generally can also impact our industry by discouraging air travel. We constantly monitor threats from terrorist groups and individuals, including from violent extremists in the U.S., both with respect to direct threats against our operations and in ways not directly related to the airline industry. In addition, the impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of commercial aircraft by parties to those conflicts can be significant. Security events, whether from external or internal sources, also pose a significant risk to our operations.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security events, or fear of such events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could have significant negative impact on us by discouraging passengers from flying and requiring changes in our operations. For example, heightened terrorist activity or geopolitical conflict may discourage air travel and reduce ticket purchases. In addition to losing revenue from decreased ticket sales and increased refunds, potential costs include increased security costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring, reputational harm and other costs. If any or all of these types of events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Over the last decade, fuel prices have increased substantially at times and have been highly volatile during the last several years. In 2015, our average fuel price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedges, was $1.90, a 45.2% decrease from our average fuel price in 2014. In 2014, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.47, a 15.7% increase from our average fuel price in 2013. In 2013, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.00, which was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier. Fuel costs represented 23.0%, 35.4% and 33.3% of our operating expense in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our ability to pass along rapidly increasing fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. At times in the past, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future. This is particularly the case when fuel prices increase rapidly. Because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase.We acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe, and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with third parties. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts alone do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.Our fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. The effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio and mark-to-market adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results.We actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel. We utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. We closely monitor the hedge portfolio and rebalance the portfolio based on market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates. In addition, we record mark-to-market adjustments (“MTM adjustments”) on our fuel hedges. MTM adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. Losses from rebalancing or MTM adjustments (or both) may have a negative impact on our financial results. 12Table of ContentsOur fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements. The margin funding requirements may require us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. If fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from Monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation, taxes or marketing, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.Because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.Under a strategic agreement that Monroe has with a significant counterparty, Monroe is exchanging non-jet fuel products for jet fuel for use in our airline operations. Monroe is required to deliver specified quantities of non-jet fuel products to the counterparty and the counterparty is required to deliver specified quantities of jet fuel to us. If either party does not have the specified quantity or type of product available, that party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the agreement. If the refinery experiences a significant interruption in operations, Monroe may be required to expend substantial amounts to purchase the products it is required to deliver, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations.In addition, the strategic agreements utilize market prices for the products being exchanged. If Monroe's cost of producing the non-jet fuel products that it is required to deliver under these agreements exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.An important part of our strategy to expand our global network has been to make significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expand our commercial relationships with these carriers. We expect to continue exploring similar non-controlling investments in, and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances with, other carriers as part of our global business strategy. These transactions and relationships involve significant challenges and risks, including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. These events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.In addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. While we work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. We may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. To the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 13Table of ContentsWe are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft.An aircraft crash or other serious accident could expose us to significant liability. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a negative public perception about safety, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business.Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements, include financial and other covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default.Our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures. These changes could result from factors that are not under our control. A decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where it may be difficult to maintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. The credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. The acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate, repay or refinance the obligations under the credit facilities or other financing arrangements.Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 18% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the NLRA, which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.If we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third-party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub, gateway or key airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our other hub, gateway or key airports in Amsterdam, Boston, Detroit, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City, Seattle and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to other major cities and to other Delta hubs and gateways. A significant extended interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or gateways could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  14Table of ContentsBreaches or lapses in the security of our technology systems and the data we store could compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.As a regular part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deception. Hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. We regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information and inadvertent misuse of data. However, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, customers', employees' or business partners' information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business.Disruptions of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, possibly having a material adverse effect on our business.Disruptions in our information technology network could result from a technology error or failure impacting our internal systems, whether hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure support on which we depend, such as power, telecommunications or the internet. The operation of our technology systems and the use of related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of other sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our network, including third-party networks we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, initiatives to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.Failure of our technology to perform reliably could have an adverse effect on our business. We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to enhance customer service, reduce costs and increase operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. The performance, reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. If our technology does not perform reliably, our business and operations could be negatively affected.Our results can fluctuate due to the effects of weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Our results of operations are impacted by severe weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which could result in loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.  15Table of ContentsAn extended disruption in services provided by our third-party regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third-party carriers in the Delta Connection program. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. In particular, some third-party regional carriers are facing a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines. If this shortage becomes more widespread, third-party regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us. To the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the Monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position. The operation of the refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. Monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for Monroe or restrict its operations. In particular, under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has adopted RFS that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into Transportation Fuels. RINs are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs.Because the refinery operated by Monroe does not blend renewable fuels, it must purchase its entire RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. As a result, Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Market prices for RINs have been volatile, marked by periods of sharp increases. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. Purchasing RINs at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.Existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.If we lose senior management personnel and other key employees and they are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and these persons are not replaced by individuals with comparable skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future. 16Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. Consolidation in the airline industry, the rise of well-funded government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures.Our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. Point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers, including Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air, place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. As a result, we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Competition is increasing from government-owned and -funded carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the United States from their hubs in the Middle East. Several of these carriers, along with carriers from China, India and Southeast Asia, are government-subsidized, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In addition, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations. Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. Additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations.  17Table of ContentsProposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace, particularly in the Northeast U.S., have included concepts such as “congestion-based” landing fees, “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. In addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. For example, the European Commission adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union, including flights to and from the U.S. While enforcement of the scheme has been deferred until April 2017, we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the European Union if fully implemented. Other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system. We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the U.S., certain European government agencies are reviewing airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion. Prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, with almost 35% of our revenues from operations outside of the U.S., our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable or volatile economic conditions in the global economy, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness, or fear of such an event, can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations"
13,DAL,DELTA AIR LINES INC,2015-02-11,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Factors
 Relating to DeltaOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and have been highly volatile during the last several years. In 2014, our average fuel price per gallon, including the impact of fuel hedges, was $3.47, a 16% increase from our average fuel price in 2013. In 2013, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.00, an 8% decrease from our average fuel price in 2012. In 2012, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.25, a 6% increase from our average fuel price in 2011, which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier. Fuel costs represented 35%, 33% and 36% of our operating expense in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our ability to pass along the higher fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. Until recently, we often were not able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs and we may not be able to do so in the future. This is particularly the case when fuel prices increase rapidly. Because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant rapid increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase.We acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe, and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with third parties. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.Significant extended disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from Monroe, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and operating results.Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation, taxes or marketing, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may impact crude oil and fuel supply and could result in shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.Because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits we expect to achieve from the operation of the refinery could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.Under one of the strategic agreements that Monroe has with a significant counterparty, Monroe is exchanging non-jet fuel products for jet fuel for use in our airline operations. Monroe is required to deliver specified quantities of non-jet fuel products to the counterparty and the counterparty is required to deliver specified quantities of jet fuel to us. If either party does not have the specified quantity or type of product available, that party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the agreement. If the refinery experiences a significant interruption in operations, Monroe may be required to expend substantial amounts to purchase the products it is required to deliver, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations. 12In addition, the strategic agreements utilize market prices for the products being exchanged. If Monroe's cost of producing the non-jet fuel products that it is required to deliver under these agreements exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Our fuel hedging activities are intended to manage the financial impact of the volatility in the price of jet fuel. The effects of rebalancing our hedge portfolio or mark-to-market adjustments may have a negative effect on our financial results.We actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel. We utilize different contract and commodity types in this program and frequently test their economic effectiveness against our financial targets. We rebalance the hedge portfolio from time to time according to market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates. In addition, we record mark-to-market adjustments (“MTM adjustments”) on our fuel hedges. MTM adjustments are based on market prices at the end of the reporting period for contracts settling in future periods. Losses from rebalancing or MTM adjustments (or both) may have a negative impact on our financial results.Our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements. The margin funding requirements may require us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. If fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from a serious accident involving our aircraft.An aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant liability. Although we believe that our insurance coverage is appropriate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident in the event that the coverage was not sufficient. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a negative public perception, which could harm our reputation, resulting in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and therefore harm our business.Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements, include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations. Our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time due to required appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures. These changes could result from factors that are not under our control. Although we are in compliance with covenant and collateral requirements, a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. We cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements.  13Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 18% of our workforce, primarily pilots, was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the NLRA, which generally allows self help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.If we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third-party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub or gateway airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our other hub or gateway airports in Amsterdam, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City, Seattle and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to other major cities and to other Delta hubs and gateways. A significant extended interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or gateways could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise passenger or employee information and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer.A serious internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third-party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our technology network. A significant individual, sustained or repeated failure of our network, including third-party networks we utilize and on which we depend, could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. Our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business. In addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our passengers and employees and information of our business partners. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy.  14Our information systems are subject to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or information through fraud or other means of deception. Hardware or software we develop or acquire may contain defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving, and may be difficult to anticipate or to detect for long periods of time. We regularly review and update procedures and processes to prevent and protect against unauthorized access to our systems and information. However, the constantly changing nature of the threats means that we may not be able to prevent all data security breaches or misuse of data. The compromise of our technology systems resulting in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of, or access to, customers', employees' or business partners' information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disruption to our operations and damage to our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business.We are dependent on technology in our operations. If our technology does not perform reliably, our business may be adversely affected. We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to enhance customer service, reduce costs and increase operational effectiveness in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in delta.com, mobile device applications, check-in kiosks and related initiatives, including security for these initiatives. The performance, reliability and security of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. If our technology does not perform reliably, our business and operations could be negatively affected.Our business is subject to the effects of weather, natural disasters and seasonality, which can cause our results to fluctuate. Our results of operations are impacted by severe weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in the frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. An extended disruption in services provided by our third-party regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third parties in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third-party carriers in the Delta Connection program. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over their operations. In particular, third-party regional carriers may face a shortage of qualified pilots due to government mandated increases in flight experience required for pilots working for airlines. If this shortage occurs, third-party regional carriers may not be able to comply with their obligations to us. To the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 15The failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to an environmental or other incident associated with the operation of the Monroe refinery could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe could incur substantial losses, including cleanup costs, fines and other sanctions and third-party claims, and its operations could be interrupted, as a result of such an incident. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations or consolidated financial position. The operation of the refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. Monroe could incur fines and other sanctions, cleanup costs and third-party claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental, health and safety requirements, which if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for Monroe or restrict its operations. Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the EPA has adopted RFS that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into Transportation Fuels. RINs are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs.Because the refinery operated by Monroe does not blend renewable fuels, it must purchase its entire RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. As a result, Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Market prices for RINs have recently been volatile, increasing significantly during 2013 before returning to more moderate levels and then increasing again in late 2014. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. Purchasing RINs at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.Existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.If we lose senior management personnel and other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to design and execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and these persons are not replaced by individuals with equal or greater skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future. 16Risk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe global airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. Consolidation in the domestic airline industry, the rise of well-funded government sponsored international carriers, changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized joint ventures have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and competitive cost structures.Our domestic operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers, including American Airlines and United Airlines, national point-to-point carriers, including Alaska Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines, and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. Point-to-point, discount and ultra low-cost carriers, including Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air, place significant competitive pressure on network carriers in the domestic market. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers. Competition is increasing from well-funded carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the United States from their hubs in the Middle East. Several of these carriers, along with carriers from China, India and Latin America, are government supported or funded, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In addition, several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Other joint ventures that have received antitrust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among United Airlines, Air Canada and Lufthansa German Airlines, a transpacific joint venture between United Airlines and All Nippon Airways, a transatlantic joint venture among American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia and a transpacific joint venture between American Airlines and Japan Air Lines.Increased competition in both the domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations. Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. The federal government adopted a significant increase in the per ticket tax effective in July 2014 and has proposed additional fees. Additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations.  17Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace, particularly in the Northeast U.S., have included concepts such as “congestion-based” landing fees, “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. In addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. For example, the European Commission adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union, including flights to and from the U.S. While enforcement of the scheme has been deferred until April 2017, if fully implemented, we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the European Union. Other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system. We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the U.S., certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion. Prolonged periods of stagnant or weak economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. As a result of the discretionary nature of air travel, the airline industry has been cyclical and particularly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Because we operate globally, with almost 35% of our revenues from operations outside of the U.S., our business is subject to economic conditions throughout the world. During periods of unfavorable economic conditions in the global economy, demand for air travel can be significantly impacted as business and leisure travelers choose not to travel, seek alternative forms of transportation for short trips or conduct business through videoconferencing. If unfavorable economic conditions occur, particularly for an extended period, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial conditions and results of operations.Terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security breaches may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Potential terrorist attacks, geopolitical conflict or security breaches, or fear of such events, even if not made directly on or involving the airline industry, could negatively affect us and the airline industry. The potential negative effects include increased security, insurance costs, impacts from avoiding flight paths over areas in which conflict is occurring, reputational harm and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales. If any or all of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness, or fear of such an event, can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational issues resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in a part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations"
15,DAL,DELTA AIR LINES INC,2014-02-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Factors
 Relating to DeltaOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and have been extremely volatile during the last several years. In 2013, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.00, an 8% decrease from our average fuel price in 2012. In 2012, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.25, a 6% increase from our average fuel price in 2011. In 2011, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.06, a 31% increase from our average fuel price in 2010, which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier. Fuel costs represented 33%, 36% and 36% of our operating expense in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Volatility in fuel costs has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our ability to pass along the higher fuel costs to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. Until recently, we often have not been able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increases in fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future. This is particularly the case when fuel prices increase rapidly. Because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase.We acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe, and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with BP and Phillips 66. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements remains subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on industry standard market price indices.Our business and results of operations are also dependent on the availability of aircraft fuel. Significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from our wholly-owned subsidiary, would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible to predict the future availability of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation, taxes or marketing, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in crude oil and fuel supply shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.Because we acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits we expect to achieve from buying fuel from Monroe could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.Under a strategic agreement that Monroe has with Phillips 66, Monroe is exchanging non-jet fuel products for jet fuel for use in our airline operations. Monroe is required to deliver specified quantities of non-jet fuel products to Phillips 66 and Phillips 66 is required to deliver specified quantities of jet fuel to us. If either party does not have the specified quantity or type of product available, that party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the exchange agreements. If the refinery experiences a significant interruption in operations, Monroe may be required to expend substantial amounts to purchase the products it is required to deliver, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations. 12In addition, the strategic agreements utilize market prices for the products being exchanged. If Monroe's cost of producing the non-jet fuel products that it is required to deliver under these agreements exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Our fuel hedging activities are intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel. Our obligation to post collateral in connection with our hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our short-term liquidity. We actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel. This fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types. The economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets. The hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates and may have a negative impact on our financial results. Our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements. The margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. If fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material adverse impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our funding obligation with respect to defined benefit pension plans we sponsor is significant and can vary materially because of changes in investment asset returns and values.As of December 31, 2013, our defined benefit pension plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately $19.1 billion and were funded through assets with a value of approximately $8.9 billion. The benefit obligation is significantly affected by investment asset returns and changes in interest rates, neither of which is in our control. We estimate that our funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plans, which are governed by ERISA and have been frozen for future accruals, is approximately $675 million in 2014. Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control, including, among other things, the market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations.Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements, include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations. Our credit facilities have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time, which may be reflected in appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures. These changes could result from factors that are not under our control. A decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The credit facilities also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. We cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements.  13Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2013, approximately 18% of our workforce was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the National Labor Relations Act (""NLRA""), which generally allows self-help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.If we or our subsidiaries are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub or gateway airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our other hub or gateway airports in Amsterdam, Cincinnati, Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City, Seattle and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub or gateway to other major cities and to other Delta hubs and gateways. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or gateways could have a serious impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on technology in our operations, and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology, our business may be adversely affected. We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in delta.com, check-in kiosks, mobile device applications and related initiatives. The performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. Because of the rapid pace of new developments, these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure. If we are unable to make these investments, our business and operations could be negatively affected. Disruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise customer information and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer.Any internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. Our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.  14In addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our customers and employees. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Any compromise of our technology systems resulting from attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance could result in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to customers', employees' or business partners' information. Any such loss, disclosure, misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and damage our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business.Our primary credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances. The initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.Most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards. Our primary credit card processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances, including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash. If circumstances were to occur that would allow American Express or our VISA/MasterCard processor to initiate a holdback, the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft.An aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant liability. In the event that the insurance that we carry to cover damages arising from future accidents is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business.Our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters and seasonality, which can cause our results to fluctuate. Our results of operations will reflect fluctuations from weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in delays and cancellations, turbulence-related injuries, and fuel consumption to avoid such weather, any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. The seasonal shifting of demand causes our financial results to vary on a seasonal basis. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. An extended disruption in services provided by our third party regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third party providers in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third party carriers in the Delta Connection program. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over the operations of these carriers. To the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 15The failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to hazards associated with the operation of a refinery by Monroe would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations. The operation of a refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation. Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. If Monroe violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, Monroe could be fined or otherwise sanctioned, which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for environmental matters for Monroe. Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has adopted Renewable Fuel Standards (“RFS”) that mandate the blending of renewable fuels into gasoline and on-road diesel (""Transportation Fuels""). Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) are assigned to renewable fuels produced or imported into the U.S. that are blended into Transportation Fuels to demonstrate compliance with this obligation. A refinery may meet its obligation under RFS by blending the necessary volumes of renewable fuels with Transportation Fuels or by purchasing RINs in the open market or through a combination of blending and purchasing RINs.Because the refinery operated by Monroe does not blend renewable fuels, it must purchase its entire RINs requirement in the secondary market or obtain a waiver from the EPA. Monroe is exposed to the market price of RINs. Market prices for RINs have recently become volatile and increased significantly during 2013 before returning to more moderate levels. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. Purchasing RINs at elevated prices could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.Existing laws or regulations could change and the minimum volumes of renewable fuels that must be blended with refined petroleum products may increase. Increases in the volume of renewable fuels that must be blended into Monroe's products could limit the refinery's production if sufficient numbers of RINs are not available for purchase or relief from this requirement is not obtained, which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.If we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, and these persons are not replaced by individuals with equal or greater skills, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future. 16Risk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. Our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hub and gateway airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City and Seattle either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs and gateways. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operations of other carriers. Discount carriers, including Southwest, JetBlue, Spirit and Allegiant have placed significant competitive pressure on us in the United States and on other network carriers in the domestic market. In addition, network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In particular, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including SkyTeam, the Star Alliance (among United, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have significantly increased competition in international markets. Increased competition has also emerged from well-funded carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad and Qatar. These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the United States from their hubs in the Middle East. Several of these carriers, along with carriers from China, India and Latin America, are government supported or funded, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines. In addition, the adoption of liberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world, including in particular the Open Skies Treaties that the U.S. has with the Member States of the European Union and Japan, could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets. Several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including our transatlantic and transpacific joint ventures, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Other joint ventures that have received anti-trust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among United, Air Canada and Lufthansa, a transpacific joint venture among United and All Nippon Airways, a transatlantic joint venture among American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia and a transpacific joint venture between American Airlines and Japan Air Lines. Consolidation in the domestic airline industry, changes in international alliances and the rise of well-funded government sponsored international carriers have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and altered cost structures. The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations.  17Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. The federal government has adopted a significant increase in the per ticket tax effective in July 2014 and has recently proposed additional fees. The ticket tax increase and additional taxes and fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations. Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace, particularly in the Northeast United States, have included concepts such as “congestion-based” landing fees, “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. In addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Events related to extreme weather delays caused the Department of Transportation to promulgate regulations imposing potentially severe financial penalties upon airlines that have flights experiencing extended tarmac delays. These regulations could have a negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances. Future regulatory action concerning climate change, aircraft emissions and noise emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. For example, the European Commission adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union, including flights to and from the United States. While enforcement of the scheme has been deferred until April 2014, if fully implemented, we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the European Union. Other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system. We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the United States, certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion. In addition, a security breach in which passenger or employee data is exposed could result in disruption to our operations, damage to our reputation and significant costs. Terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry, including substantial revenue declines and cost increases, which resulted in industry-wide liquidity issues. Potential terrorist attacks or security breaches or fear of such events, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect us and the airline industry. The potential negative effects include increased security (including as a result of our global operations), insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales. Our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the United States.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 18Reductions in coverage or lack of access to war risk insurance coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly (1) reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims from acts of terrorism, war or similar events and (2) increased the premiums for such coverage. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government has been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The U.S. Secretary of Transportation has extended coverage through September 30, 2014, and we expect the coverage to be further extended. The withdrawal of government support of airline war-risk insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially. Such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than currently provided by the U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism or, may result in a material increase to our operating expense"
12,DAL,DELTA AIR LINES INC,2013-02-13,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Factors
 Relating to DeltaOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases, including in the cost of crude oil, could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and have been extremely volatile during the last several years. In 2012, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.25, a 6% increase from our average fuel price in 2011. In 2011, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.06, a 31% increase from our average fuel price in 2010. In 2010, our average fuel price per gallon was $2.33, an 8% increase from an average fuel price of $2.15 in 2009, which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier. Fuel costs represented 36%, 36% and 30% of our operating expense in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Volatility in fuel costs has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. We often have not been able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future. This is particularly the case when fuel prices increase rapidly. Because passengers often purchase tickets well in advance of their travel, a significant increase in fuel price may result in the fare charged not covering that increase.We expect to acquire a significant amount of jet fuel from our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe, and through strategic agreements that Monroe has with BP and Phillips 66. The cost of the fuel we purchase under these arrangements will remain subject to volatility in the cost of crude oil and jet fuel. In addition, we will continue to purchase a significant amount of aircraft fuel in addition to what we obtain from Monroe. Our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases as these contracts typically establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price.Our business and results of operations are also dependent on the availability of aircraft fuel. Significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel, including from our wholly-owned subsidiary, would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible to predict the future availability of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation, taxes or marketing, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in crude oil and fuel supply shortages in the future. Shortages in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition.Because we plan to acquire a large amount of our jet fuel from Monroe, the disruption or interruption of production at the refinery could have an impact on our ability to acquire jet fuel needed for our operations. Disruptions or interruptions of production at the refinery could result from various sources including a major accident or mechanical failure, interruption of supply or delivery of crude oil, work stoppages relating to organized labor issues, or damage from severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism. If the refinery were to experience an interruption in operations, disruptions in fuel supplies could have negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the financial benefits we expect to achieve from buying fuel from Monroe could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.Under a strategic agreement that Monroe has with Phillips 66, Monroe is exchanging non-jet fuel products for jet fuel for use in our airline operations. Monroe is required to deliver specified quantities of non-jet fuel products to Phillips 66 and Phillips 66 is required to deliver specified quantities of jet fuel to us. If either party does not have the specified quantity or type of product available, that party is required to procure any such shortage to fulfill its obligation under the exchange agreements. If the refinery experiences a significant interruption in operations, Monroe may be required to expend substantial amounts to purchase the products it is required to deliver, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations.12In addition, the strategic agreements utilize market prices for the products being exchanged. If Monroe's cost of producing the non-jet fuel products that it is required to deliver under these agreements exceeds the value it receives for those products, the financial benefits we expect to achieve through the ownership of the refinery and our consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Our fuel hedging activities are intended to reduce the financial impact from changes in the price of jet fuel. Our obligation to post collateral in connection with our hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our short-term liquidity. We actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to reduce the financial impact on us from changes in the price of jet fuel. This fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types. The economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets. The hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates and may have a negative impact on our financial results. Our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements. The margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. If fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material adverse impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our funding obligation with respect to defined benefit pension plans we sponsor is significant and can vary materially because of changes in investment asset returns and values.As of December 31, 2012, our defined benefit pension plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately $21.5 billion and were funded through assets with a value of approximately $8.2 billion. The benefit obligation is significantly affected by investment asset returns and changes in interest rates, neither of which is in our control. We estimate that our funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plans, which are governed by ERISA and have been frozen for future accruals, is approximately $675 million in 2013. Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control, including, among other things, the market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations.Our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs. We have substantial indebtedness, which could: •make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events; •limit our ability to borrow additional money for working capital, restructurings, capital expenditures, research and development, investments, acquisitions or other purposes, if needed, and increasing the cost of any of these borrowings; •limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures; and/or •limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition and demand for new services, placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt, and making us more vulnerable than our competitors who have less debt to a downturn in our business, industry or the economy in general. In addition, a substantial level of indebtedness, particularly because a significant portion of our assets are currently subject to liens, could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business. These liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance and many other factors not within our control. 13Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements and indentures, include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations. Our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time, which may be reflected in appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures. These changes could result from factors that are not under our control. A decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders or the trustee could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. We cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements. Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 15% of our workforce was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Monroe's relations with unions representing its employees are governed by the National Labor Relations Act (""NLRA""), which generally allows self-help after a collective bargaining agreement expires.If we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act or the NLRA, as the case may be. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups in current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in Amsterdam, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs could have a serious impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 14We are dependent on technology in our operations, and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology, our business may be adversely affected. We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in delta.com, check-in kiosks, mobile device applications and related initiatives. The performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. Because of the rapid pace of new developments, these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure. If we are unable to make these investments, our business and operations could be negatively affected. Disruptions or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations, compromise customer information and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and reputation to suffer.Any internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third party locations, or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. Our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business. In addition, as a part of our ordinary business operations, we collect and store sensitive data, including personal information of our customers and employees. The secure operation of the networks and systems on which this type of information is stored, processed and maintained is critical to our business operations and strategy. Any compromise of our technology systems resulting from attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance could result in the loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to customers', employees' or business partners' information. Any such loss, disclosure, misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations and damage our reputation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business.Our primary credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances. The initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.Most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards. Our primary credit card processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances, including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash. If circumstances were to occur that would allow American Express or our VISA/MasterCard processor to initiate a holdback, the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft.An aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability. In the event that the insurance that we carry to cover damages arising from future accidents is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business.15Our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters and seasonality, which can cause our results to fluctuate. Our results of operations will reflect fluctuations from weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in fuel consumption to avoid such weather, turbulence-related injuries, delays and cancellations, any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. An extended disruption in services provided by our third party regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third party providers in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third party carriers in the Delta Connection program. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over the operations of these carriers. To the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The failure or inability of insurance to cover a significant liability related to hazards associated with the operation of a refinery by Monroe would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.Monroe's refining operations are subject to various hazards unique to refinery operations, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions and natural catastrophes. Monroe's insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities and Monroe could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts greater than its insurance coverage. In addition, Monroe's ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which it has no control. If Monroe were to incur a significant liability for which it is not fully insured or for which insurance companies do not or are unable to provide coverage, this could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results of operations. The operation of a refinery by Monroe is subject to significant environmental regulation.  Failure to comply with environmental regulations or the enactment of additional regulation could have a negative impact on our consolidated financial results. Monroe's operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and extensive regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures and greenhouse gas emissions. If Monroe violates or fails to comply with these laws and regulations, Monroe could be fined or otherwise sanctioned, which if significant could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. In addition, the enactment of new environmental laws and regulations, including any laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could significantly increase the level of expenditures required for environmental matters for Monroe. If we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.16Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (“NOLs”), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).As of December 31, 2012, Delta reported a consolidated federal pretax NOL carryforward of approximately $16.3 billion. Both Delta and Northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the merger, Northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change. Delta also experienced a subsequent ownership change on December 17, 2008 as a result of the merger, the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactions involving the sale of our common stock within the testing period.The Delta and Northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability to utilize pre-change NOLs that were not subject to limitation, and could further limit the ability to utilize NOLs that were already subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on the ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated subsequent to December 17, 2008 are not limited.17Risk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. Our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK and Salt Lake City either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operators. Discount carriers, including Southwest, AirTran (now owned by Southwest),  JetBlue, Spirit and Allegiant have placed significant competitive pressure on us in the United States and on other network carriers in the domestic market. In addition, other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization. American Airlines has recently filed for bankruptcy protection, which may enable it to substantially reduce its costs. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In particular, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including SkyTeam, the Star Alliance (among United, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have significantly increased competition in international markets. Increased competition has also emerged from well-funded carriers in the Gulf region, including Emirates, Etihad and Qatar.  These carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the United States from their hubs in the Middle East. Several of these carriers,  along with carriers from China, India and Latin America, are government supported or funded, which has allowed them to grow quickly, reinvest in their product and expand their global presence at the expense of U.S. airlines. In addition, the adoption of liberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world, including in particular the Open Skies Treaties that the U.S. has with the Member States of the European Union and Japan, could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets. Several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including our transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Other joint ventures that have received anti-trust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among United, Air Canada and Lufthansa, a transpacific joint venture among United and All Nippon Airways, a transatlantic joint venture among American Airlines, British Airways and Iberia and a transpacific joint venture between American Airlines and Japan Air Lines. Consolidation in the domestic airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and altered cost structures. The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations. 18Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. The federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax and has recently proposed additional departure fees. A ticket tax increase or additional fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations. Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace, particularly in the Northeast United States, have included concepts such as “congestion-based” landing fees, “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. In addition, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Events related to extreme weather delays caused the Department of Transportation to promulgate regulations imposing potentially severe financial penalties upon airlines that have flights experiencing extended tarmac delays. These regulations could have a negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances. Future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. For example, the European Commission has adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union, including flights to and from the United States. If fully implemented, we expect that this system would impose additional costs on our operations in the European Union. Other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system. We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the United States, certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion. In addition, a security breach in which passenger or employee data is exposed could result in disruption to our operations, damage to our reputation and significant costs. Terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry, including substantial revenue declines and cost increases, which resulted in industry-wide liquidity issues. Potential terrorist attacks or security breaches or fear of such events, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect us and the airline industry. The potential negative effects include increased security (including as a result of our global operations), insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales. Our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the United States.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations.19Our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly (1) reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims from acts of terrorism, war or similar events and (2) increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government has been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The U.S. Secretary of Transportation has extended coverage through September 30, 2013, and we expect the coverage to be further extended. The withdrawal of government support of airline war-risk insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially, if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than currently provided by the U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material increase to our operating expense or may not be obtainable at all, resulting in an interruption to our operations"
10,DAL,DELTA AIR LINES INC,2012-02-10,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Risk Factors
 Relating to DeltaOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs or cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. Likewise, significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations and operating results.Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decade and have been extremely volatile during the last several years. In 2011, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.06, a 31% increase from an average fuel price of $2.33 in 2010. In 2010, our average fuel price per gallon was $2.33, an 8% increase from an average fuel price of $2.15 in 2009. In 2008, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.16, a 41% increase from an average price of $2.24 in 2007, which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier. Fuel costs represented 36%, 30% and 29% of our operating expense in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Volatility in fuel costs has had a significant negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers may be affected by the competitive nature of the airline industry. We often have not been able to increase our fares to offset fully the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in the future. In addition, our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection against price increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our aircraft fuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources and under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price. We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible to predict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, natural disasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future. Additional increases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us.Our fuel hedging activities are intended to provide an offset against increases in jet fuel prices. Our obligation to post collateral in connection with our hedge contracts may have a substantial impact on our short-term liquidity.We actively manage our fuel price risk through a hedging program intended to provide an offset against increases in jet fuel prices. This fuel hedging program utilizes several different contract and commodity types, which are used together to create a risk mitigating hedge portfolio. The economic effectiveness of this hedge portfolio is frequently tested against our financial targets. The hedge portfolio is rebalanced from time to time according to market conditions, which may result in locking in gains or losses on hedge contracts prior to their settlement dates and may have a negative impact on our financial results. Our fuel hedge contracts contain margin funding requirements, which are driven by changes in price of the underlying commodity and the contracts used. The margin funding requirements may cause us to post margin to counterparties or may cause counterparties to post margin to us as market prices in the underlying hedged items change. If fuel prices decrease significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into fuel hedge contracts, we may be required to post a significant amount of margin, which could have a material adverse impact on the level of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.Our funding obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans we sponsor is significant and can vary materially because of changes in investment asset returns and values.As of December 31, 2011, our defined benefit pension plans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately $19.3 billion and were funded through assets with a value of approximately $7.8 billion. The benefit obligation is significantly affected by investment asset returns and changes in interest rates, neither of which is in the control of Delta. We estimate that our funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plans, which are governed by ERISA and have been frozen for future accruals, is approximately $700 million in 2012. Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual funding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside our control, including, among other things, the market performance of assets; statutory requirements; and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and the rate of participant attrition. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a material impact on our future funding obligations.11Our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.We have substantial indebtedness, which could:•make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions or catastrophic external events;•limit our ability to borrow additional money for working capital, restructurings, capital expenditures, research and development, investments, acquisitions or other purposes, if needed, and increasing the cost of any of these borrowings;•limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures; and/or•limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition and demand for new services, placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt, and making us more vulnerable than our competitors who have less debt to a downturn in our business, industry or the economy in general.In addition, a substantial level of indebtedness, particularly because a significant portion of our assets are currently subject to liens, could limit our ability to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business. These liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions, industry trends, performance and many other factors not within our control.Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements and indentures, include financial and other covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations.Our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and other covenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed charge coverage ratios, minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The value of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time, which may be reflected in appraisals of collateral required by our credit agreements and indentures. These changes could result from factors that are not under our control. A decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where we may not be able to maintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings. If we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. These covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications.The credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for such financings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders or the trustee could, among other things, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. We cannot provide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings or notes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default. In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements.Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants, aircraft maintenance technicians, ground support personnel and other personnel. As of December 31, 2011, approximately 16% of our workforce was unionized. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after a collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargaining processes required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted. Our agreement with our pilots becomes amendable in December 2012. All of our agreements with workgroups at our airline subsidiary, Comair, are currently amendable. Comair is in discussions with representatives of the respective unions and we cannot predict the outcome of those discussions.12If we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionized work groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements or if additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act. Strikes or labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct business. Likewise, if third party regional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement with their unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on our operations.Extended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverse impact on our operations.Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our other hub airports in Amsterdam, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these hub operations includes flights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities and to other Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs could have a serious impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations, and if our technology fails or we are unable to continue to invest in new technology, our business may be adversely affected.We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have made and continue to make significant investments in delta.com, check-in kiosks and related initiatives. The performance and reliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and our ability to compete effectively. Because of the rapid pace of new developments, these initiatives will continue to require significant capital investments in our technology infrastructure. If we are unable to make these investments, our business and operations could be negatively affected. If we are unable to manage these challenges effectively, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.In addition, any internal technology error or failure impacting systems hosted internally at our data centers or externally at third party locations or large scale external interruption in technology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology could impact our customer service and result in increased costs. Our technology systems and related data may also be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial and reputational consequences to our business.Our primary credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certain circumstances. The initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.Most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards. Our primary credit card processing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except in certain circumstances, including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash. If circumstances were to occur that would allow American Express or our VISA/MasterCard processor to initiate a holdback, the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft.An aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability. In the event that the insurance that we carry to cover damages arising from future accidents is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that is operated by an airline that is one of our regional carriers or codeshare partners could create a public perception that our aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business.13Our business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters and seasonality, which can cause our results to fluctuate.Our results of operations will reflect fluctuations from weather, natural disasters and seasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service and create air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. In addition, increases in frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons or other severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result in increases in fuel consumption to avoid such weather, turbulence-related injuries, delays and cancellations, any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and higher costs. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters, particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periods than during the remainder of the year. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather, natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.An extended disruption in services provided by our third party regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We utilize the services of third party providers in a number of areas in support of our operations that are integral to our business, including third party carriers in the Delta Connection program. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected service performance, we do not have direct control over the operations of these carriers. To the extent that a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers are unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced or our expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadership and other key employees, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (“NOLs”), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).As of December 31, 2011, Delta reported a consolidated federal pretax NOL carryforward of approximately $16.8 billion. Both Delta and Northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the merger, Northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change. Delta also experienced a subsequent ownership change on December 17, 2008 as a result of the merger, the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactions involving the sale of our common stock within the testing period.The Delta and Northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability to utilize pre-change NOLs that were not subject to limitation, and could further limit the ability to utilize NOLs that were already subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on the ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated subsequent to December 17, 2008 are not limited.14Risk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.The airline industry is highly competitive, marked by significant competition with respect to routes, fares, schedules (both timing and frequency), services, products, customer service and frequent flyer programs. Our domestic operations are subject to competition from both traditional network and discount carriers, some of which may have lower costs than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, we face significant competition at our domestic hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-JFK and Salt Lake City either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operators.Discount carriers, including Southwest, AirTran (now owned by Southwest) and JetBlue, have placed significant competitive pressure on us in the United States and on other network carriers in the domestic market. In addition, other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over the last several years through restructuring and bankruptcy reorganization. American has recently filed for bankruptcy protection, which may enable it to substantially reduce its costs. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our international operations are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers. Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to and beyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities through these relationships. In particular, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, including SkyTeam, the Star Alliance (among United Air Lines, Continental Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, Air Canada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas and others) have significantly increased competition in international markets. The adoption of liberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world, including in particular the Open Skies Treaties that the U.S. has with the Member States of the European Union and Japan, could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets.Several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including our transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Other joint ventures that have received anti-trust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among United, Continental, Air Canada and Lufthansa, a transpacific joint venture among United, Continental and All Nippon Airways, a transatlantic joint venture among American, British Airways and Iberia, and a transpacific joint venture between American and Japan Air Lines.Consolidation in the domestic airline industry and changes in international alliances have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and altered cost structures.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The rapid spread of a contagious illness can have a material adverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations.15Terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in the airline industry, including substantial revenue declines and cost increases, which resulted in industry-wide liquidity issues. Potential terrorist attacks or security breaches or fear of such events, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect us and the airline industry. The potential negative effects include increased security (including as a result of our global operations), insurance and other costs and lost revenue from increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales. Our financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the United States.The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations may increase our operating costs.Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAA's regulations.Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from time to time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. For example, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. The federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax and has recently proposed additional departure fees. A ticket tax increase or additional fees, if implemented, could negatively impact our results of operations.Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace, particularly in the Northeast United States, have included concepts such as “congestion-based” landing fees, “slot auctions” or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on the airlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines to respond to competitive actions by other airlines. In contrast, the failure of the federal government to upgrade the U.S. air traffic control system has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain congested markets. The failure to improve the air traffic control system could lead to increased delays and inefficiencies in flight operations as demand for U.S. air travel increases, having a material adverse effect on our operations. Failure to update the air traffic control system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of an updated system that may be imposed on air carriers, may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Events related to extreme weather delays caused the DOT to promulgate regulations imposing potentially severe financial penalties upon airlines that have flights experiencing extended tarmac delays. These regulations could have a negative impact on our operations in certain circumstances.Future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have a significant effect on the airline industry. For example, the European Commission has adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union, including flights to and from the United States. We expect that this system will impose additional costs on our operations in the European Union. Other laws or regulations such as this emissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations and financial results, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur under such a system.We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. In addition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the United States, certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operating costs and could impact our operations and any future expansion. In addition, a security breach in which passenger or employee data is exposed could result in disruption to our operations, damage to our reputation and significant costs.16Our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly (1) reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events and (2) increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government has been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, to passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The coverage currently extends through September 30, 2012, and we expect the coverage to be further extended. The withdrawal of government support of airline war-risk insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially, if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently provided by the U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable at all, resulting in an interruption to our operations"

 Relating to DeltaOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraftfuel. High fuel costs or cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operatingresults. Likewise, significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materiallyadversely affect our operations and operating results.     Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability ofaircraft fuel. Fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decadeand spiked at record high levels in 2008 before falling dramatically during the latter part of2008. In 2010, our average fuel price per gallon was $2.33, an 8% increase from an average fuelprice of $2.15 in 2009. In 2008, our average fuel price per gallon was $3.16, a 41% increase froman average price of $2.24 in 2007, which in turn was significantly higher than fuel prices just afew years earlier. Fuel costs represented 30%, 29%, and 38% of our operating expense in 2010, 2009and 2008, respectively. Total operating expense for 2008 reflects a $7.3 billion non-cash chargefrom an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and $1.1 billion in primarily non-cashmerger-related charges. Including these charges, fuel costs accounted for 28% of total operatingexpense in 2008. Volatility in fuel costs has had a significant negative effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition.     Our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers may be affected by thecompetitive nature of the airline industry. We often have not been able to increase our fares tooffset fully the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in thefuture.     In addition, our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection againstprice increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our aircraftfuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchaseaircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources and under contracts that permit therefiners to set the price. In an effort to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices, we usederivative instruments, which generally consist of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collarand call option contracts, though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure.Depending on the type of hedging instrument used, our ability to benefit from declines in fuelprices may be limited.12Table of Contents     We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible topredict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, naturaldisasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmentalpolicy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft fuelproduction capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additionalfuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future. Additional increases in fuel costs ordisruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us.Our funding obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans we sponsor is significantand can vary materially because of changes in investment asset returns and values.     The recent financial crisis and economic downturn resulted in broadly lower investment assetreturns and values, including in the defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor for eligibleemployees and retirees. As of December 31, 2010, the defined benefit pension plans had an estimatedbenefit obligation of approximately $17.5 billion and were funded through assets with a value ofapproximately $8.2 billion. The benefit obligation is significantly affected by investment asset returns and changes in interest rates, neither of which is in the control of Delta. We estimate that our funding requirement for our defined benefitpension plans, which are governed by ERISA and have been frozen for future accruals, isapproximately $600 million in 2011. The significant level of required funding is due primarily tothe decline in the investment markets in 2008, which negatively affected the value of our pensionassets. Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actual fundingrequirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factors outside ourcontrol, including, among other things, the market performance of assets; statutory requirements;and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and the rate ofparticipant attrition. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have a materialimpact on our future funding obligations.Our obligation to post collateral in connection with our hedge contracts may have a substantialimpact on our short-term liquidity.     Under hedge contracts that we may enter into from time to time, counterparties to thosecontracts can require us to fund the margin associated with any loss position on the contracts. Iffuel prices fall significantly below the levels at the time we enter into fuel hedging contracts,we may be required to post a significant amount of collateral, which could have an impact on thelevel of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.Our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adverselyaffect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.     We have substantial indebtedness, which could:  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations tothe payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds availablefor operations and future business opportunities;   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligationsunder our indebtedness;   limit our ability to borrow additional money for working capital,restructurings, capital expenditures, research and development, investments, acquisitionsor other purposes, if needed, and increasing the cost of any of these borrowings;   make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions orcatastrophic external events;   limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures;   reduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business andeconomic conditions; and/or   limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economicconditions, including increased competition and demand for new services, placing us at adisadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt, and making us morevulnerable than our competitors who have less debt to a downturn in our business, industryor the economy in general.13Table of Contents     In addition, a substantial level of indebtedness, particularly because substantially all ofour assets are currently subject to liens, could limit our ability to obtain additional financingon acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporatepurposes. We have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business.These liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions,industry trends, performance and many other factors not within our control.Agreements governing our debt, including credit agreements and indentures, include financial andother covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations.     Our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and othercovenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed chargecoverage ratios, minimum unrestricted cash reserves and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. Thevalue of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time, including dueto factors that are not under our control, resulting in a situation where we may not be able tomaintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities and indentures containother negative covenants customary for such financings. If we fail to comply with these covenantsand are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. These covenantsare subject to important exceptions and qualifications.     The credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for suchfinancings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders or the trustee could, among otherthings, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. We cannotprovide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings ornotes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default.In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilitiesor the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements.Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.     Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants andother personnel. As of December 31, 2010, approximately 17% of our workforce was unionized. Strikesor labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conductbusiness. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by theRailway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and alabor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway LaborAct generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after acollective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargainingprocesses required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted.     In addition, if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionizedwork groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements orif additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptionsor stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act. Likewise, if third partyregional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement withtheir unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of theircollective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages,subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on ouroperations.Completion of the integration of the Delta and Northwest Airlines workforces may present challenges.     The successful integration of the pre-merger NWA operations into Delta and achievement of theanticipated benefits of the combination depend on integrating the pre-merger Deltaand NWA employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations. While integration of anumber of the workgroups (including pilots, aircraft maintenance technicians, dispatchers, meteorologists, simulator technicians and office and clerical staff) has beencompleted, completion of the integration of certain workgroups (including flight attendants,airport employees and reservations employees) of the two pre-merger airlines will require the finalresolution of union representation issues. We cannot predict when or how these remainingrepresentation issues will be resolved. Unexpected delay, expense or other challenges tointegrating the workforces could affect our financial performance.14Table of ContentsExtended interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have amaterial adverse impact on our operations.     Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our otherhub airports in Amsterdam, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-JFK,Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City and Tokyo-Narita.

Theinsurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In theevent that the insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from anaccident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that isoperated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception thatour aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelersbeing reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business.15Table of ContentsOur business is subject to the effects of weather and natural disasters and seasonality, whichcan cause our results to fluctuate.     Our results of operations will reflect fluctuations from weather, natural disasters andseasonality. Severe weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly disrupt service andcreate air traffic control problems. These events decrease revenue and can also increase costs. Inaddition, increases in frequency, severity or duration of thunderstorms, hurricanes, typhoons orother severe weather events, including from changes in the global climate, could result inincreases in fuel consumption to avoid such weather, turbulence-related injuries, delays andcancellations, any of which would increase the potential for greater loss of revenue and highercosts. In addition, demand for air travel is typically higher in the June and September quarters,particularly in international markets, because there is more vacation travel during these periodsthan during the remainder of the year. Because of fluctuations in our results from weather,natural disasters and seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarilyindicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period arenot necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.An extended disruption in services provided by our third party regional carriers could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations.     We utilize the services of third party providers in a number of areas in support of ouroperations that are integral to our business, including third party carriers in the DeltaConnection program. While we have agreements with these providers that define expected serviceperformance, we do not have direct control over the operations of these carriers. To the extentthat a significant disruption in our regional operations occurs because any of these providers areunable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time, our revenue may be reduced orour expenses may be increased resulting in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S.federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.     In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporationthat undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize itspre-change net operating losses (NOLs), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownershipchange occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders,applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over suchstockholders lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).     As of December 31, 2010, Delta reported a consolidated federal and state pretax NOLcarryforward of approximately $17.5 billion. Both Delta and Northwest experienced an ownershipchange in 2007 as a result of their respective plans of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the merger, Northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change.Delta also experienced a subsequent ownership change on December 17, 2008 as a result of themerger, the issuance of equity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactionsinvolving the sale of our common stock within the testing period.     The Delta and Northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability toutilize pre-change NOLs that were not subject to limitation, and could further limit the ability toutilize NOLs that were already subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on the ability to useNOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier thanotherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expireunused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules andlimitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated subsequent to December 17, 2008are not limited.16Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in themarketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materiallyadversely affected.     We face significant competition with respect to routes, services and fares. Our domesticroutes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers, some of which have lowercosts than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, weface significant competition at our domestic hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis,Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-JFK and Salt Lake City either directly at those airports or at thehubs of other airlines that are located in close proximity to our hubs. We also face competition insmaller to medium-sized markets from regional jet operators.     Discount carriers, including Southwest, AirTran and JetBlue, have placed significantcompetitive pressure on us in the United States and on other network carriers in the domesticmarket. In addition, other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over thelast several years. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintaina competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.     Our international routes are subject to competition from both domestic and foreign carriers.Through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers, U.S.carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation, such as services to andbeyond traditional European and Asian gateway cities. Similarly, foreign carriers have obtainedincreased access to interior U.S. passenger traffic beyond traditional U.S. gateway cities throughthese relationships. In particular, alliances formed by domestic and foreign carriers, includingthe Star Alliance (among United Air Lines, Continental Airlines, Lufthansa German Airlines, AirCanada and others) and the oneworld alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways, Qantas andothers) have significantly increased competition in international markets. The adoption ofliberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world,including in particular the Open Skies Treaties with the Member States of the European Union andJapan, could significantly increase competition among carriers serving those markets.     Several joint ventures among U.S. and foreign carriers, including our transatlantic jointventure with Air France-KLM and Alitalia, have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing theparticipating carriers to coordinate schedules, pricing, sales and inventory. Other joint venturesthat have received anti-trust immunity include a transatlantic alliance among United, Continental,Air Canada and Lufthansa, a transpacific joint venture among United, Continental and All NipponAirways, a transatlantic joint venture among American, British Airways and Iberia, and atranspacific joint venture between American and Japan Air Lines.     Consolidation in the domestic airlineindustry and changes in international alliances have altered andwill continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation ofairlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks andaltered cost structures.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business andresults of operations.     The rapid spread of a contagious illness can have a material adverse effect on the demand forworldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees are quarantined asthe result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions or operationalproblems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of the world in whichwe operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations.17Table of ContentsTerrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and operating results.     The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in theairline industry, including substantial revenue declines and cost increases, which resulted inindustry-wide liquidity issues. Potential terrorist attacks or security breaches or fear of such events, even if notmade directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect us and the airline industry. Thepotential negative effects include increased security (including as a result of our global operations), insurance and other costs and lost revenuefrom increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales. Our financial resources might not besufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other internationalhostilities involving the United States.The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations mayincrease our operating costs.     Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result insignificant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and other regulationsrelating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. Weexpect to continue incurring expenses to comply with the FAAs regulations.     Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from timeto time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. The industry is heavily taxed. For example,the Aviation and Transportation Security Act mandates the federalization of certain airportsecurity procedures and imposes security requirements on airports and airlines, most of which arefunded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax on airlines. The federal government has onseveral occasions proposed a significant increase in the per ticket tax. A ticket tax increase, ifimplemented, could negatively impact our results of operations.     Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace,particularly in the Northeast United States, have included concepts such as congestion-basedlanding fees, slot auctions or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on theairlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines torespond to competitive actions by other airlines. Furthermore, events related to extreme weatherdelays have caused Congress and the DOT to consider proposals related to airlines handling oflengthy flight delays. The recent enactment of such a regulation by the DOT could have a negativeimpact on our operations in certain circumstances.     Future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have asignificant effect on the airline industry. For example, the European Commission has adopted anemissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union, includingflights to and from the United States. We expect that such a system will impose significant costson our operations in the European Union. Other laws or regulations such as this emissions tradingscheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect our operations andfinancial results, either through direct costs in our operations or through increases in costs forjet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increased costs that they incur undersuch a system.     We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy ofpassenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. Inaddition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the UnitedStates, certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacypractices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operatingcosts and could impact our operations and any future expansion.18Table of ContentsOur insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the September 11, 2001 terroristattacks, and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have amaterial adverse impact on our business and operating results.     As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantly(1) reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers forliability to persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims resulting from acts ofterrorism, war or similar events and (2) increased the premiums for such coverage and for aviationinsurance in general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government has been providing U.S.airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, topassengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The coverage currently extendsthrough September 30, 2011, and we expect the coverage to be further extended. The withdrawal ofgovernment support of airline war-risk insurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurancecoverage commercially, if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantially lessdesirable coverage than that currently provided by the U.S. government, may not be adequate toprotect our risk of loss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a material increase to ouroperating expenses or may not be obtainable at all, resulting in an interruption to our operations"
3,DAL,DELTA AIR LINES INC,2010-02-24,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisk Factors
 Relating to DeltaOur business and results of operations are dependent on the price and availability of aircraftfuel. High fuel costs or cost increases could have a materially adverse effect on our operatingresults. Likewise, significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel would materiallyadversely affect our operations and operating results.     Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability ofaircraft fuel. Fuel prices have increased substantially since the middle part of the last decadeand spiked at record high levels in 2008 before falling dramatically during the latter part of2008. In 2009, our average fuel price per gallon was $2.15. In 2008, our average fuel price pergallon was $3.16, a 41% increase from an average price of $2.24 in 2007, which in turn wassignificantly higher than fuel prices just a few years earlier. Fuel costs represented 29%, 38%,and 31% of our operating expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Total operating expense for2008 reflects a $7.3 billion non-cash charge from an impairment of goodwill and other intangibleassets and $1.1 billion in primarily non-cash merger-related charges. Including these charges, fuelcosts accounted for 28% of total operating expense in 2008. Fuel costs have had a significantnegative effect on our results of operations and financial condition.     Our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to our customers is limited by thecompetitive nature of the airline industry. We often have not been able to increase our fares tooffset the effect of increased fuel costs in the past and we may not be able to do so in thefuture.     In addition, our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not provide material protection againstprice increases or assure the availability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of our aircraftfuel under contracts that establish the price based on various market indices. We also purchaseaircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sources and under contracts that permit therefiners to set the price. In an effort to manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices, we usederivative instruments, which are comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel swap, collar andcall option contracts, though we may not be able to successfully manage this exposure. Depending onthe type of hedging instrument used, our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may belimited.     We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraft fuel, but it is impossible topredict the future availability or price of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, naturaldisasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmentalpolicy concerning aircraft fuel production, transportation or marketing, changes in aircraft fuelproduction capacity, environmental concerns and other unpredictable events may result in additionalfuel supply shortages and fuel price increases in the future. Additional increases in fuel costs ordisruptions in fuel supplies could have additional negative effects on us.The global economic recession has resulted in weaker demand for air travel and may createchallenges for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.     As the effects of the global economic recession have been felt in our domestic andinternational markets, we have experienced significantly weaker demand for air travel. Our demandbegan to slow during the December 2008 quarter and global economic conditions in 2009 substantiallyreduced U.S. airline industry revenues in 2009 compared to 2008. As a result, we reduced ourconsolidated capacity by 6% in 2009 compared to the combined capacity of Delta and Northwest during2008. Demand for air travel could remain weak if an economic recovery is slow or even fall furtherif a recession returns, and overall demand could fall lower than we are able prudently to reducecapacity. The weakness in the United States and international economies is having a significantnegative impact on our results of operations and could continue to have a significant negativeimpact on our future results of operations.The global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in waysthat we currently cannot predict.     The credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continueto have an impact on our business and our financial condition. In particular, the financial crisisand economic downturn resulted in broadly lowerinvestment asset returns and values, including in the defined benefit pension plans that wesponsor for eligible employees and13Table of Contentsretirees. As of December 31, 2009, the defined benefit pensionplans had an estimated benefit obligation of approximately $17.0 billion and were funded throughassets with a value of approximately $7.6 billion. We estimate that our funding requirements forour defined benefit pension plans, which are governed by ERISA and have been frozen for futureaccruals, are approximately $720 million in 2010. The significant level of required funding is dueprimarily to the decline in the investment markets in 2008, which negatively affected the value ofour pension assets. Estimates of pension plan funding requirements can vary materially from actualfunding requirements because the estimates are based on various assumptions concerning factorsoutside our control, including, among other things, the market performance of assets; statutoryrequirements; and demographic data for participants, including the number of participants and therate of participant attrition. Results that vary significantly from our assumptions could have amaterial impact on our future funding obligations.Our obligation to post collateral in connection with our fuel hedge contracts may have asubstantial impact on our short-term liquidity.     Under fuel hedge contracts that we may enter into from time to time, counterparties to thosecontracts may require us to fund the margin associated with any loss position on the contracts. Forexample, at December 31, 2008, our counterparties required us to fund $1.2 billion of fuel hedgemargin. However, at December 31, 2009, counterparties were required to fund us a net $10 million.If fuel prices fall significantly below the levels at the time we enter into hedging contracts, wemay be required to post a significant amount of collateral, which could have an impact on the levelof our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.Our substantial indebtedness may limit our financial and operating activities and may adverselyaffect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.     We have substantial indebtedness, which could:  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations tothe payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds availablefor operations and future business opportunities;   make it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligationsunder our indebtedness;   limit our ability to borrow additional money for working capital,restructurings, capital expenditures, research and development, investments, acquisitionsor other purposes, if needed, and increasing the cost of any of these borrowings;   make us more vulnerable to economic downturns, adverse industry conditions orcatastrophic external events;   limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures;   reduce our flexibility in planning for or responding to changing business andeconomic conditions; and/or   limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economicconditions, including increased competition and demand for new services, placing us at adisadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt, and making us morevulnerable than our competitors who have less debt to a downturn in our business, industryor the economy in general.     In addition, a substantial level of indebtedness, particularly because substantially all ofour assets are currently subject to liens, could limit our ability to obtain additional financingon acceptable terms or at all for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporatepurposes. We have historically had substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business.These liquidity needs could vary significantly and may be affected by general economic conditions,industry trends, performance and many other factors not within our control.14Table of ContentsAgreements governing our debt, including credit agreements and indentures, include financial andother covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations.     Our credit facilities and indentures for secured notes have various financial and othercovenants that require us to maintain, depending on the particular agreement, minimum fixed chargecoverage ratios, minimum unrestricted cash reserves and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. Thevalue of the collateral that has been pledged in each facility may change over time, including dueto factors that are not under our control, resulting in a situation where we may not be able tomaintain the collateral coverage ratio. In addition, the credit facilities and indentures containother negative covenants customary for such financings. If we fail to comply with these covenantsand are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, an event of default would result. These covenantsare subject to important exceptions and qualifications.     The credit facilities and indentures also contain other events of default customary for suchfinancings. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders or the trustee could, among otherthings, declare outstanding amounts due and payable, and our cash may become restricted. We cannotprovide assurance that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance the borrowings ornotes under any of the credit facilities if such amounts were accelerated upon an event of default.In addition, an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilitiesor the indentures could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements.Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect our operations.     Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers of pilots, flight attendants andother personnel. As of December 31, 2009, approximately 39% of our workforce was unionized. Strikesor labor disputes with our unionized employees may adversely affect our ability to conductbusiness. Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by theRailway Labor Act, which provides that a collective bargaining agreement between an airline and alabor union does not expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date. The Railway LaborAct generally prohibits strikes or other types of self-help actions both before and after acollective bargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until the collective bargainingprocesses required by the Railway Labor Act have been exhausted.     In addition, if we or our affiliates are unable to reach agreement with any of our unionizedwork groups on future negotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargaining agreements orif additional segments of our workforce become unionized, we may be subject to work interruptionsor stoppages, subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act. Likewise, if third partyregional carriers with whom we have contract carrier agreements are unable to reach agreement withtheir unionized work groups on current or future negotiations regarding the terms of theircollective bargaining agreements, those carriers may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages,subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act, which could have a negative impact on ouroperations.The ability to realize fully the anticipated benefits of our merger with Northwest may depend onthe successful integration of the businesses of Delta and Northwest.     Our merger with Northwest involved the combination of two companies which operated asindependent public companies prior to the merger. We are devoting significant attention andresources to integrating our business practices and operations in order to achieve the benefits ofthe merger, including expected synergies. If we are unable to integrate our business practices andoperations in a manner that allows us to achieve the anticipated revenue and cost synergies, or ifachievement of such synergies takes longer or costs more than expected, the anticipated benefits ofthe merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. Inaddition, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees,diversion of managements attention, the disruption or interruption of, or the loss of momentum inour ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any ofwhich could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees orour ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, or could reduce our earnings orotherwise adversely affect our business and financial results. We expect to incur total cash costsof approximately $500 million over approximately three years to integrate the two airlines.15Table of ContentsCompletion of the integration of the Delta and NWA workforces may present significant challenges.     The successful integration of the pre-merger Northwest operations into Delta and achievementof the anticipated benefits of the combination depend significantly on integrating the pre-mergerDelta and NWA employee groups and on maintaining productive employee relations. While integrationof a number of the workgroups (including pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians) has beensuccessfully completed, completion of the integration of certain workgroups (including flightattendants, airport employees and reservations employees) of the two pre-merger airlines willrequire the resolution of potentially difficult issues, including but not limited to the process andtiming for determining whether the combined post-merger workgroups wish to have unionrepresentation. Unexpected delay, expense or other challenges to integrating the workforces couldimpact the expected synergies from the merger and affect our financial performance.Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub airports could have a material adverseimpact on our operations.     Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at the Atlanta airport and at our otherhub airports in Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City,Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam and Tokyo-Narita. Each of these hub operations includes flightsthat gather and distribute traffic from markets in the geographic region surrounding the hub toother major cities and to other Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption in service atthe Atlanta airport or at one of our other hubs could have a serious impact on our business,financial condition and results of operations.We are increasingly dependent on technology in our operations, and if our technology fails or weare unable to continue to invest in new technology or integrate the systems and technologies ofDelta and Northwest, our business may be adversely affected.     We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiatives to reduce costs and to enhancecustomer service in order to compete in the current business environment. For example, we have madesignificant investments in delta.com, check-in kiosks and related initiatives. The performance andreliability of the technology are critical to our ability to attract and retain customers and ourability to compete effectively. These initiatives will continue to require significant capitalinvestments in our technology infrastructure. If we are unableto make these investments, our business and operations could be negatively affected. In addition,we may face challenges associated with integrating complex systems and technologies that supportedthe separate operations of Delta and Northwest. If we are unable to manage these challengeseffectively, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.     In addition, any internal technology error or failure or large scale external interruption intechnology infrastructure we depend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet, maydisrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained or repeated failure of technology couldimpact our customer service and result in increased costs. Our technology systems and related datamay be vulnerable to a variety of sources of interruption due to events beyond our control,including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses,hackers and other security issues. While we have in place, and continue to invest in, technologysecurity initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may not be adequate or implementedproperly to prevent a business disruption and its adverse financial consequences to our business.If we experience losses of senior management personnel and other key employees, our operatingresults could be adversely affected.     We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers and other keyemployees to execute our business plans. If we experience a substantial turnover in our leadershipand other key employees, our performance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore, wemay be unable to attract and retain additional qualified executives as needed in the future.16Table of ContentsOur credit card processors have the ability to take significant holdbacks in certaincircumstances. The initiation of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect onour liquidity.     Most of the tickets we sell are paid for by customers who use credit cards. Our credit cardprocessing agreements provide that no holdback of receivables or reserve is required except incertain circumstances, including if we do not maintain a required level of unrestricted cash. Ifcircumstances were to occur that would allow American Express or our Visa/MasterCard processor toinitiate a holdback, the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be material.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming from any accident involving our aircraft.     An aircraft crash or other accident could expose us to significant tort liability. Theinsurance we carry to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate. In theevent that the insurance is not adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses from anaccident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraft that we operate or an aircraft that isoperated by an airline that is one of our codeshare partners could create a public perception thatour aircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm our reputation, result in air travelersbeing reluctant to fly on our aircraft and harm our business.Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S.federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.     In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporationthat undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize itspre-change net operating losses (NOLs), to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownershipchange occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders,applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over suchstockholders lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).     As of December 31, 2009, Delta reported a consolidated federal and state NOL carryforward ofapproximately $17.3 billion. Both Delta and Northwest experienced an ownership change in 2007 as aresult of their respective plans of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Asa result of the merger, Northwest experienced a subsequent ownership change. Delta also experienceda subsequent ownership change on December 17, 2008 as a result of the merger, the issuance ofequity to employees in connection with the merger and other transactions involving the sale of ourcommon stock within the testing period.     The Delta and Northwest ownership changes resulting from the merger could limit the ability toutilize pre-change NOLs that were not subject to limitation, and could further limit the ability toutilize NOLs that were already subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on the ability to useNOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier thanotherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expireunused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules andlimitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated subsequent to December 17, 2008are not limited.Our merger with Northwest affects the comparability of our historical financial results.     On October 29, 2008, a subsidiary of Delta merged with and into Northwest. Our historicalfinancial results under GAAP include the results of Northwest for periods after October 29, 2008,but not for periods before October 29, 2008. Accordingly, while our financial results for the yearended December 31, 2009 include the results of Northwest for the entire period, our financialresults for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the results of Northwest only for the periodfrom October 30 to December 31, 2008. This complicates your ability to compare our results ofoperations and financial condition for periods that include Northwests results with periods thatdo not.17Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe airline industry is highly competitive and, if we cannot successfully compete in themarketplace, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adverselyaffected.     We face significant competition with respect to routes, services and fares. Our domesticroutes are subject to competition from both new and established carriers, some of which have lowercosts than we do and provide service at low fares to destinations served by us. In particular, weface significant competition at our hub airports in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Memphis,Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York-JFK, Salt Lake City, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Amsterdam andTokyo-Narita either directly at those airports or at the hubs of other airlines that are located inclose proximity to our hubs. We also face competition in smaller to medium-sized markets fromregional jet operators.     Low-cost carriers, including Southwest, AirTran and JetBlue, have placed significantcompetitive pressure on us in the United States and on other network carriers in the domesticmarket. In addition, other network carriers have also significantly reduced their costs over thelast several years. Our ability to compete effectively depends, in part, on our ability to maintaina competitive cost structure. If we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level, then ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Inlight of increased jet fuel costs and other issues in recent years, we expect consolidation tooccur in the airline industry. As a result of consolidation, we may face significant competitionfrom larger carriers that may be able to generate higher amounts of revenue and compete moreefficiently.     In addition, we compete with foreign carriers, both on interior U.S. routes, due to marketingand codesharing arrangements, and in international markets. Through marketing and codesharingarrangements with U.S. carriers, foreign carriers have obtained access to interior U.S. passengertraffic. Similarly, U.S. carriers have increased their ability to sell internationaltransportation, such as transatlantic services to and beyond European cities, through allianceswith international carriers. International marketing alliances formed by domestic and foreigncarriers, including the Star Alliance (among United Airlines, Continental, Lufthansa GermanAirlines and others) and the oneworld Alliance (among American Airlines, British Airways andothers) have also significantly increased competition in international markets. The adoption ofliberalized Open Skies Aviation Agreements with an increasing number of countries around the world,including in particular the Open Skies agreement between the United States and the Member States ofthe European Union, has accelerated this trend. Similarly, the recent Open Skies agreement betweenthe United States and Japan could significantly increase competition among carriers serving thosemarkets.The rapid spread of contagious illnesses can have a material adverse effect on our business andresults of operations.     The rapid spread of a contagious illness, such as the H1N1 flu virus, can have a materialadverse effect on the demand for worldwide air travel and therefore have a material adverse effecton our business and results of operations. Acceleration of the spread of H1N1 during the fluseason in the Northern Hemisphere could have a significant adverse impact on the demand for airtravel and as a result our financial results in addition to the impact that we experienced duringthe spring of 2009. Moreover, our operations could be negatively affected if employees arequarantined as the result of exposure to a contagious illness. Similarly, travel restrictions oroperational problems resulting from the rapid spread of contagious illnesses in any part of theworld in which we operate may have a materially adverse impact on our business and results ofoperations.Terrorist attacks or international hostilities may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and operating results.     The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 caused fundamental and permanent changes in theairline industry, including substantial revenue declines and cost increases, which resulted inindustry-wide liquidity issues. Additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks, even if notmade directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect us and the airline industry. Thepotential negative effects include increased security, insurance and other costs and lost revenuefrom increased ticket refunds and decreased ticket sales. Our financial resources might not besufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other internationalhostilities involving the United States.18Table of ContentsThe airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, and new regulations mayincrease our operating costs.     Airlines are subject toextensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result insignificant costs. For instance, the FAA from time to timeissues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft thatnecessitate significant expenditures. We expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with theFAAs regulations.     Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have also been imposed from timeto time that significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. For example,the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which became law in November 2001, mandates thefederalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirementson airports and airlines, most of which are funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax onairlines. The federal government has on several occasions proposed a significant increase in theper ticket tax. The proposed ticket tax increase, if implemented, could negatively impact ourresults of operations.     Proposals to address congestion issues at certain airports or in certain airspace,particularly in the Northeast United States, have included concepts such as congestion-basedlanding fees, slot auctions or other alternatives that could impose a significant cost on theairlines operating in those airports or airspace and impact the ability of those airlines torespond to competitive actions by other airlines. Furthermore, events related to extreme weatherdelays have caused Congress and the DOT to consider proposals relatedto airlines handling of lengthy flight delays during extreme weather conditions. The recentenactment of such a regulation by the DOT could have anegative impact on our operations in certain circumstances.     Future regulatory action concerning climate change and aircraft emissions could have asignificant effect on the airline industry. For example, the EuropeanCommission has adopted an emissions trading scheme applicable to all flights operating in the European Union,including flights to and from the United States. We expect that such a system will imposesignificant costs on our operations in the European Union. Other laws or regulations such as thisemissions trading scheme or other U.S. or foreign governmental actions may adversely affect ouroperations and financial results, either through direct costs in our operations or throughincreases in costs for jet fuel that could result from jet fuel suppliers passing on increasedcosts that they incur under such a system.     We and other U.S. carriers are subject to domestic and foreign laws regarding privacy ofpassenger and employee data that are not consistent in all countries in which we operate. Inaddition to the heightened level of concern regarding privacy of passenger data in the UnitedStates, certain European government agencies are initiating inquiries into airline privacypractices. Compliance with these regulatory regimes is expected to result in additional operatingcosts and could impact our operations and any future expansion.Our insurance costs have increased substantially as a result of the September 11, 2001 terroristattacks, and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have a materialadverse impact on our business and operating results.     As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, aviation insurers significantlyreduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liabilityto persons (other than employees or passengers) for claims resulting from acts of terrorism, war orsimilar events. At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums for suchcoverage and for aviation insurance in general. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. government hasbeen providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance to cover losses, including those resultingfrom terrorism, to passengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull. The coveragecurrently extends through August 31, 2010. The withdrawal of government support of airline war-riskinsurance would require us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially, if available. Suchcommercial insurance could have substantially less desirable coverage than that currently providedby the U.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk of loss from future acts ofterrorism, may result in a material increase to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable atall, resulting in an interruption to our operations"
1,DAL,DELTA AIR LINES INC,2006-03-27,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS"" -->ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSRisk Factors
 Relating to DeltaWe filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the    Bankruptcy Code on September 14, 2005 and are subject to    the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11    proceedings.     For the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, ouroperations, including our ability to execute our business plan,are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated withbankruptcy. Risks and uncertainties associated with ourChapter 11 proceedings include the following:   the actions and decisions of our    creditors and other third parties who have interests in our    Chapter 11 proceedings that may be inconsistent with our    plans;        our ability to obtain court    approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11    proceedings prosecuted from time to time;        our ability to develop,    prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with    respect to the Chapter 11 proceedings;        our ability to obtain and    maintain normal terms with vendors and service providers;        our ability to maintain    contracts that are critical to our operations; and        risks associated with third    parties seeking and obtaining court approval to terminate or    shorten the exclusivity period for us to propose and confirm a    plan of reorganization, to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee or    to convert the cases to Chapter 7 cases.         These risks and uncertainties could affect our business andoperations in various ways. For example, negative events orpublicity associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings couldadversely affect our sales of tickets and the relationship withour customers, as well as with vendors and employees, which inturn could adversely affect our operations and financialcondition, particularly if the Chapter 11 proceedings areprotracted. Also, transactions outside the ordinary course ofbusiness are subject to the prior approval of the BankruptcyCourt, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certainevents or take advantage of certain opportunities.     Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with ourChapter 11 proceedings, the ultimate impact that eventsthat occur during these proceedings will have on our business,financial condition and results of10Table of Contentsoperations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified, andthere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as agoing concern.Employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may    adversely affect our operations.     Our business is labor intensive, utilizing large numbers ofpilots, flight attendants and other personnel. Approximately 17%of our workforce is unionized. Strikes or labor disputes withour and our affiliates unionized employees may adverselyaffect our ability to conduct our business. Relations betweenair carriers and labor unions in the United States are governedby the Railway Labor Act, which provides that a collectivebargaining agreement between an airline and a labor union doesnot expire, but instead becomes amendable as of a stated date.The Railway Labor Act generally prohibits strikes or other typesof self-help actions both before and after a collectivebargaining agreement becomes amendable, unless and until thecollective bargaining processes required by the Railway LaborAct have been exhausted.     We have been and continue to be in negotiations with ALPA toreduce our pilot labor costs as required under our businessplan. Because we were not able to reach a consensual agreementwith ALPA, on November 1, 2005, we filed a motion with theBankruptcy Court under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Codeto reject our collective bargaining agreement with ALPA. InDecember 2005, we reached an interim agreement with ALPA, whichwas approved by the Bankruptcy Court and ratified byDeltas pilots. The interim agreement provides, among otherthings, for a reduction in (1) hourly pilot wage rates of14% and (2) other pilot pay and cost items equivalent toapproximately an additional 1% hourly wage reduction. Thesereductions became effective December 15, 2005, and remainin effect until the earlier of (1) our entering into acomprehensive agreement with ALPA on changes to the pilotcollective bargaining agreement; or (2) the time that theneutral panel described below issues its final order as towhether Delta is authorized to reject the pilot collectivebargaining agreement under the legal standards ofSection 1113.     The interim agreement provides that Delta and ALPA will seek tonegotiate a tentative comprehensive agreement, and establishesthe March 2006 time limits: (1) March 1, 2006, for theparties negotiating committees to reach a tentativeagreement; (2) March 8, 2006, for approval by the ALPAMaster Executive Council; and (3) March 22, 2006, forpilot ratification. Because the first of the March 2006 timelimits was not met, pursuant to our interim agreement with ALPA,the matter at issue in Deltas Section 1113 motion hasbeen submitted to a mutually agreed upon, neutral panel of threeexperts in airline labor matters for a binding decision on thatissue. The interim agreement provides that the panelsdecision must be issued no later than 45 days after thefailure to meet the applicable March 2006 time limit, which isApril 15, 2006. We cannot predict the outcome of theneutral panels decision as to whether or not we would beauthorized to reject the collective bargaining agreement.     If the neutral panel determines that we are authorized to rejectthe collective bargaining agreement, ALPA has threatened toinitiate a strike, which we believe should not be permittedunder the Railway Labor Act. However, we cannot predict theoutcome of any effort we might undertake to obtain court reliefto prevent or stop a strike or other forms of work disruption. Astrike or other form of significant work disruption by ALPAwould likely have a material negative impact on our ability tocontinue operating our business and would trigger an event ofdefault under our Post-Petition Financing Agreements if all orsubstantially all of our flight and other operations aresuspended for longer than two days. As a result, we could berequired to cease operations permanently.     In addition, if we or our affiliates are unable to reachagreement with any of our unionized work groups on futurenegotiations regarding the terms of their collective bargainingagreements, or if additional segments of our workforce becomeunionized, we may be subject to work interruptions or stoppages,subject to the requirements of the Railway Labor Act and theBankruptcy Code.We have substantial liquidity needs and face significant    liquidity pressure.     At December 31, 2005, our cash and cash equivalents andshort-term investments were $2.0 billion. This amountreflects the net proceeds from our sale of ASA to SkyWest andthe net proceeds from our borrowings under our post-petitionfinancing agreements (Post-Petition FinancingAgreements), which consist of a Secured Super-PriorityDebtor-in-PossessionCredit Facility from a syndicate of lenders (the DIPCredit Facility) and a modification agreement withAmerican Express Travel Related Services11Table of ContentsCompany, Inc. (Amex) and American Express Bank,F.S.B. that modified existing agreements with Amex under whichAmex purchases SkyMiles from us (the Amex Post-PetitionFacility).     We have substantial liquidity needs in the operation of ourbusiness and face significant liquidity challenges due tohistorically high aircraft fuel prices, low passenger mileyields, credit card processor holdbacks and cash reserves andother cost pressures. Accordingly, we believe that our cash andcash equivalents and short-term investments will remain underpressure during 2006 and thereafter. Because substantially allof our assets are encumbered and our Post-Petition FinancingAgreements contain restrictions against additional borrowing, webelieve we will not be able to obtain any material amount ofadditional debt financing during our Chapter 11 proceedings.Our Post-Petition Financing Agreements include financial    and other covenants that impose substantial restrictions on our    financial and business operations.     The Post-Petition Financing Agreements include financialcovenants that, among other things, require us to(1) maintain unrestricted funds in an amount not less than$750 million through May 31, 2006; $1 billion atall times from June 1, 2006 through November 30, 2006;$750 million at all times from December 1, 2006through February 28, 2007; and $1 billion at all timesthereafter and (2) achieve certain levels of EBITDAR(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization andaircraft rent, as defined). For additional information about ourfinancial covenants, see Note 8 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial Statements.     Our ability to comply with the EBITDAR covenant depends on ourability to achieve the targeted benefits of our business plan incertain timeframes. If we are unable to achieve the targetedbenefits that are contemplated in our business plan, we may notbe able to comply with our EBITDAR covenant.     In addition, our Post-Petition Financing Agreements restrict ourability to, among other things, incur or secure additionalindebtedness, make investments, sell assets, pay dividends orrepurchase stock. If we fail to comply with the covenants in thePost-Petition Financing Agreements and are unable to obtain awaiver or amendment, an event of default would result under thePost-Petition Financing Agreements.     The Post-Petition Financing Agreements contain other events ofdefault customary fordebtor-in-possessionfinancings of this type, including cross defaults to each otherand certain change of control events. Additionally, thesuspension of all or substantially all of our flight and otheroperations for longer than two days would, in mostcircumstances, including as the result of our inability tooperate because of a strike by our pilots, be an event ofdefault. If an event of default were to occur, the lenders coulddeclare outstanding borrowings under these agreementsimmediately due and payable. As a result, we could be requiredto cease operations permanently.We have experienced significant losses in recent years,    which have had a material adverse effect on our financial    condition. The implementation of our business plan requires that    we make significant changes to our business.     We recorded a consolidated net loss of $3.8 billion for theyear ended December 31, 2005. During the five years endedDecember 31, 2005, we reported an aggregate consolidatednet loss of approximately $12.3 billion. As reflected byour Chapter 11 filing, these losses are not sustainable.     During the last several years, we implemented profit improvementinitiatives, which became the basis for our transformation planannounced in late 2004 to address the conditions that led tothese losses. Our transformation plan has a goal of providing uswith approximately $5 billion in annual benefits by the endof 2006 (as compared to 2002), primarily through costreductions. We are on track to obtain the full $5 billionin benefits by the end of 2006. As of December 31, 2005, wehad implemented initiatives intended to achieve approximately90% of these benefits.     The benefits we are realizing under our transformation plan are,however, being outpaced and masked by historically high aircraftfuel prices. We continue to operate in a weak pricingenvironment, which limits our ability to increase fares tooffset high fuel costs. Accordingly, we must make additionalsubstantial changes in our business to further reduce our coststructure and increase our revenues in order to maintainadequate liquidity and achieve long-term viability. In thecontext of our Chapter 11 proceedings, we have adopted abusiness plan to target the delivery of an additional$3 billion in annual benefits by the end of 2007.12Table of Contents     We cannot assure you that we will achieve the targeted benefitsunder our business plan or that these benefits, even ifachieved, will be adequate for us to maintain financialviability. In addition, our business plan involves significantchange to our business. We cannot assure you that we will besuccessful in implementing the plan. In addition, theimplementation of key elements of the plan, such as employee jobreductions, may have an adverse impact on our business andresults of operations, particularly in the near term.Furthermore, our existing international operations and plans forexpansion of our international operations under our businessplan could be adversely affected by factors such as reversals ordelays in the opening of foreign markets, currency and politicalrisks, taxation and changes in international governmentregulation of our operations, including the ability to obtain orretain needed route authorities and/or slots.Our business is dependent on the price and availability of    aircraft fuel. Continued periods of historically high fuel costs    will continue to materially adversely affect our operating    results. Likewise, significant disruptions in the supply of    aircraft fuel would materially adversely affect our operations    and operating results.     Our operating results are significantly impacted by changes inthe price and availability of aircraft fuel. Fuel pricesincreased substantially in 2004 and 2005 and remained athistorically high levels at the end of 2005. In 2005, ouraverage fuel price per gallon rose 47% to $1.71 as compared toan average price of $1.16 in 2004. In 2004, our average fuelprice per gallon rose 42% as compared to an average price of81.78¢ in 2003. Our fuel costs represented 23%, 16%, and13% of our operating expenses in 2005, 2004 and 2003,respectively. These increasing costs have had a significantnegative effect on our results of operations and financialcondition.     During the months of September and October, 2005, our fuel costsand supplies were negatively impacted by two hurricanes, Katrinaand Rita, that struck the Gulf Coast region of the UnitedStates. These storms interfered with the operations ofproduction facilities and refineries in Louisiana and Texas. Asa result, our fuel costs significantly increased during thelatter part of 2005, primarily from drastically increased costsof refining crude oil into jet fuel.     Our ability to pass along the increased costs of fuel to ourcustomers is limited by the competitive nature of the airlineindustry. We generally have not been able to increase our faresto fully offset the effect of increased fuel costs in the pastand we may not be able to do so in the future.     In addition, our aircraft fuel purchase contracts do not providematerial protection against price increases or assure theavailability of our fuel supplies. We purchase most of ouraircraft fuel from petroleum refiners under contracts thatestablish the price based on various market indices. We alsopurchase aircraft fuel on the spot market, from offshore sourcesand under contracts that permit the refiners to set the price.To attempt to reduce our exposure to changes in fuel prices, weperiodically enter into heating and crude oil derivativescontracts, though we may not be able to successfully manage thisexposure. In December 2005, the Bankruptcy Court authorized usto enter into fuel hedging contracts for up to 30% of ourmonthly estimated fuel consumption, with hedging allowed inexcess of that level if we obtained approval of the officialcommittee of unsecured creditors appointed in ourChapter 11 proceedings (the CreditorsCommittee) or the Bankruptcy Court. In February 2006, wereceived approval from the Creditors Committee to hedge up to50% of our estimated 2006 aggregate fuel consumption, with nosingle month exceeding 80% of our estimated fuel consumption. Wealso agreed that we would not enter into any fuel hedgingcontracts that extend beyond December 31, 2006 withoutadditional approval from the Creditors Committee or theBankruptcy Court. Depending on the type of hedging instrumentused, our ability to benefit from declines in fuel prices may belimited.     We are currently able to obtain adequate supplies of aircraftfuel, but it is impossible to predict the future availability orprice of aircraft fuel. Weather-related events, naturaldisasters, political disruptions or wars involving oil-producingcountries, changes in governmental policy concerning aircraftfuel production, transportation or marketing, changes inaircraft fuel production capacity, environmental concerns, andother unpredictable events may result in additional fuel supplyshortages and fuel price increases in the future. Additionalincreases in fuel costs or disruptions in fuel supplies couldhave additional negative effects on us.13Table of ContentsThe retirement of a significant number of our pilots prior    to their normal retirement age of 60 could require significant    contributions to our defined benefit pension plan for pilots,    significantly disrupt our operations and negatively impact our    revenue.     Under our defined benefit pension plan for pilots (PilotPlan), Delta pilots who retire can elect to receive 50% ofthe present value of their accrued pension benefit in a lump sumin connection with their retirement and the remaining 50% oftheir accrued pension benefit as an annuity after retirement. Inrecent years, our pilots have retired prior to their normalretirement age of 60 at greater than historical levels due to(1) a perceived risk of rising interest rates, which couldreduce the amount of their lump sum pension benefit; and/or(2) concerns about their ability to receive a lump sumpension benefit if a notice of intent to terminate the PilotPlan is issued during a restructuring under Chapter 11 ofthe Bankruptcy Code. While the Pilot Plan is currentlyprohibited from making the lump sum payments, it is currentlyprojected that the lump sum feature would become available inOctober 2006 if the Pilot Plan is not subject to terminationproceedings prior to that date. If a significant number of pilotearly retirements occurs in the near future, the resulting lumpsum payments, combined with other factors, could trigger arequirement to make contributions to the Pilot Plan in excess ofamounts currently estimated. The amount of any additionalcontribution depends on factors that are not currently knownand, therefore, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Anadditional contribution could have a material adverse impact onour liquidity.     A significant number of pilot early retirements in the nearfuture could also disrupt our operations and have a materialadverse impact on our revenues because there may not be enoughpilots to operate certain aircraft types for a period of time,the duration of which cannot be determined. We and ALPA hadagreed to certain provisions that helped mitigate the effect ofpilot early retirements on our operations over the past eighteenmonths, but these provisions expired on December 31, 2005.As of January 31, 2006, approximately 1,700 of our 5,900pilots on the active roster are at or over age 50 and thuswere eligible to retire at the beginning of February 2006.Our defined benefit pension plan funding requirements are    significant, are affected by factors beyond our control and    could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.     Our funding obligations for certain of our defined benefitpension plans (DB Plans) are governed by theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA). During the year ended December 31,2005, we contributed approximately $325 million to ourDB Plans. Estimates of future funding requirements underthe DB Plans are based on various assumptions, includinglegislative changes regarding these obligations. Theseassumptions include, among other things, the actual andprojected market performance of assets of the DB Plans;future long-term corporate bond yields; statutory requirements;the terms of the DB Plans; and demographic data forparticipants in the DB Plans, including the number ofparticipants, their salaries and the rate of participantattrition.     Assuming current funding rules and current plan design, weestimate that the funding requirements under our DB Plansfor 2006, 2007 and 2008 will aggregate approximately$3.4 billion, absent any liquidity shortfall contributionrequirements. Substantially this entire amount relates tobenefits earned prior to the Petition Date. We believe we arenot required to fund such pre-petition amounts while operatingunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As noted below inLegal Proceedings in Item 3, DP3 and certainother entities unsuccessfully challenged this position in theBankruptcy Court and the issue is currently on appeal to theDistrict Court. If we were required to make such pre-petitioncontributions to the DB Plans, it would have an adverse effecton our liquidity and could result in an earlier resumption ofthe Pilot Plan making the lump sum payments to retiring pilots,which, as described above, could cause disruption in ouroperations and have a material effect on our revenues. If ourDB Plans continue after we emerge from Chapter 11, wemay be required to fully fund required contributions at thatdate, including contributions related to benefits earned priorto our Petition Date.     Based on our preliminary five-year forecast and additionalinformation regarding the assets and liabilities for theDB Plans, we believe that, under current pension fundingrules, we would need to seek distress termination of both theNonpilot Plan and the Pilot Plan in order to successfullyreorganize and emerge from Chapter 11. Proposed legislationthat passed in the U.S. Senate and is now pending in aHouse-Senate Conference Committee would extend our fundingobligations for our DB Plans over 20 years. If thepending14Table of Contentslegislation is enacted in the form in which it passed theU.S. Senate, we hope to avoid a distress termination of theNonpilot Plan, though there is no assurance that we can do so.We currently believe, however, that the existence of the lumpsum option in the Pilot Plan and the significant number of earlypilot retirements it may drive make it unlikely that we couldsatisfy our funding obligations to that plan even if the pendinglegislation is enacted in the form in which it passed theU.S. Senate.     For additional information about our pension plans, seeNote 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated FinancialStatements.Interruptions or disruptions in service at one of our hub    airports could have a material adverse impact on our    operations.     Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at theAtlanta Airport and at our other hub airports in Cincinnati, JFKand Salt Lake City. Each of these hub operations includesflights that gather and distribute traffic from markets in thegeographic region surrounding the hub to other major cities andto other Delta hubs. A significant interruption or disruption inservice at the Atlanta Airport or at one of our other hubs couldhave a serious impact on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.We are increasingly dependent on technology in our    operations, and if our technology fails or we are unable to    continue to invest in new technology, our business may be    adversely affected.     We have become increasingly dependent on technology initiativesto reduce costs and to enhance customer service in order tocompete in the current business environment. For example, wehave made significant investments in check-in kiosks, DeltaDirect phone banks and related initiatives across the system.The performance and reliability of our technology are criticalto our ability to attract and retain customers and our abilityto compete effectively. In this challenging businessenvironment, particularly during our Chapter 11proceedings, we may not be able to continue to make sufficientcapital investments in our technology infrastructure to deliverthese expected benefits.     In addition, any internal technology error or failure, or largescale external interruption in technology infrastructure wedepend on, such as power, telecommunications or the internet,may disrupt our technology network. Any individual, sustained orrepeated failure of our technology could impact our customerservice and result in increased costs. Like all companies, ourtechnology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of sources ofinterruption due to events beyond our control, including naturaldisasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures,computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. While wehave in place, and continue to invest in, technology securityinitiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures may notbe adequate or implemented properly to prevent a businessdisruption and its adverse financial consequences to ourbusiness.If we experience further losses of our senior management    and other key employees, our operating results could be    adversely affected, and we may not be able to attract and retain    additional qualified management personnel.     We are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of ourofficers and other key employees to execute our business plans.Our deteriorating financial performance, along with ourChapter 11 proceedings, creates uncertainty that has led toa significant increase in unwanted attrition. We are at risk oflosing management talent critical to the successfultransformation and ongoing operation of our business. If wecontinue to experience a substantial turnover in our leadershipand other key employees, including as a result of plannedoverhead reductions required by our business plan, ourperformance could be materially adversely impacted. Furthermore,we may be unable to attract and retain additional qualifiedexecutives as needed in the future.We are facing significant litigation and if any such    significant litigation is concluded in a manner adverse to us,    our financial condition and operating results could be    materially adversely affected.     We are involved in legal proceedings relating to antitrustmatters, employment practices, environmental issues and othermatters concerning our business. As a result of ourChapter 11 filing, most attempts to collect, secure orenforce remedies with respect to pre-petition claims against usare subject to the automatic15Table of Contentsstay provisions of Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Codeand certain liabilities could be discharged in theChapter 11 proceedings. While we cannot reasonably estimatethe potential loss for certain of our legal proceedings because,for example, the litigation is in its early stages or theplaintiff does not specify damages being sought, if the outcomeof any significant litigation is adverse to us and suchproceedings are not discharged in our Chapter 11proceedings, our financial condition and operating results couldbe materially adversely impacted.We are at risk of losses and adverse publicity stemming    from any accident involving our aircraft.     If one of our aircraft were to crash or be involved in anaccident, we could be exposed to significant tort liability. Theinsurance we carry to cover damages arising from any futureaccidents may be inadequate. In the event that our insurance isnot adequate, we may be forced to bear substantial losses froman accident. In addition, any accident involving an aircraftthat we operate or is operated by an airline that is one of ourcodeshare partners could create a public perception that ouraircraft are not safe or reliable, which could harm ourreputation, result in air travelers being reluctant to fly onour aircraft and harm our business.Issuances of equity in connection with our restructuring    increase the likelihood that in the future our ability to    utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards    may be limited.     Under federal income tax law, a corporation is generallypermitted to deduct from taxable income in any year netoperating losses carried forward from prior years. We have netoperating loss carryforwards of approximately $8.5 billionas of December 31, 2005. Our ability to deduct netoperating loss carryforwards could be subject to a significantlimitation if we were to undergo an ownership changefor purposes of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of1986, as amended, during or as a result of our Chapter 11proceedings.Risk Factors
 Relating to the Airline IndustryThe airline industry is highly competitive and, if we    cannot successfully compete in the marketplace, our business,    financial condition and operating results will be materially    adversely affected.     We face significant competition with respect to routes, servicesand fares. Our domestic routes are subject to competition fromboth new and established carriers, some of which havesubstantially lower costs than we do and provide service at lowfares to destinations served by us. Our revenues continue to bematerially adversely impacted by the growth of low-costcarriers, with which we compete in most of our markets.Significant expansion by low-cost carriers to our hub airportscould have an adverse impact on our business. We also faceincreasing competition in smaller to medium-sized markets fromrapidly expanding regional jet operators. In addition, wecompete with foreign carriers, both on interiorU.S. routes, due to marketing and codesharing arrangements,and in international markets.     The continuing growth of low-cost carriers, including Southwest,AirTran and JetBlue, in the United States has placed significantcompetitive pressure on us and other network carriers. Inaddition, other hub-and-spoke carriers such as US Airways andUnited Airlines have reduced their costs through Chapter 11reorganization. Our ability to compete effectively with low-costcarriers, restructured carriers and other airlines depends, inpart, on our ability to achieve a cost structure that iscompetitive with those carriers. If we cannot lower our costsand subsequently maintain our costs at a competitive level, thenour business, financial condition and operating results willcontinue to be materially adversely affected.The airline industry has changed fundamentally since the    terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and our business,    financial condition and operating results have been materially    adversely affected.     Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, theairline industry has experienced fundamental and permanentchanges, including substantial revenue declines and costincreases, which have resulted in industry-wide liquidityissues. The terrorist attacks significantly reduced the demandfor air travel, and additional terrorist activity involving theairline industry could have an equal or greater impact.Additional terrorist attacks or fear of such attacks, even ifnot made directly on the airline industry, negatively affect usand the airline industry. Although global economic conditionshave improved from their depressed levels afterSeptember 11, 2001, the airline industry in the UnitedStates has continued to experience a reduction in16Table of Contentshigh-yield business travel and increased price sensitivity incustomers purchasing behavior. In addition, aircraft fuelprices have increased significantly during the last severalyears, were at historically high levels for an extended periodduring 2005 and remained at or near those levels during theearly part of 2006. The airline industry has continued to add orrestore capacity despite these conditions. We expect all ofthese conditions will persist and will continue to adverselyimpact our operations and our efforts to return to profitability.The airline industry is subject to extensive government    regulation, and new regulations may increase our    operating costs.     Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legalcompliance requirements that result in significant costs. Forinstance, the FAA from time to time issues directives and otherregulations relating to the maintenance and operation ofaircraft that necessitate significant expenditures. We expect tocontinue incurring expenses to comply with the FAAsregulations.     Other laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and chargeshave also been imposed from time to time that significantlyincrease the cost of airline operations or reduce revenues. Forexample, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, whichbecame law in November 2001, mandates the federalization ofcertain airport security procedures and imposes additionalsecurity requirements on airports and airlines, most of whichare funded by a per ticket tax on passengers and a tax onairlines. The federal government has recently proposed asignificant increase in the per ticket tax. Due to the weakrevenue environment, the existing tax has negatively impactedour revenues because we generally have not been able to increaseour fares to pass these fees on to our customers. Similarly, theproposed ticket tax increase, if implemented, could negativelyimpact our revenues.     Furthermore, we and other U.S. carriers are subject todomestic and foreign laws regarding privacy of passenger andemployee data that are not consistent in all countries in whichwe operate. In addition to the heightened level of concernregarding privacy of passenger data in the United States,certain European government agencies are initiating inquiriesinto airline privacy practices. Compliance with these regulatoryregimes is expected to result in additional operating costs andcould impact our operations and any future expansion.Our insurance costs have increased substantially as a    result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and further    increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could    have a material adverse impact on our business and operating    results.     As a result of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001,aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount ofinsurance coverage available to commercial air carriers forliability to persons (other than employees or passengers) forclaims resulting from acts of terrorism, war or similar events.At the same time, aviation insurers significantly increased thepremiums for such coverage and for aviation insurance ingeneral. Since September 24, 2001, the U.S. governmenthas been providing U.S. airlines with war-risk insurance tocover losses, including those resulting from terrorism, topassengers, third parties (ground damage) and the aircraft hull.The coverage currently extends through August 31, 2006(with a possible extension to December 31, 2006 at thediscretion of the Secretary of Transportation). The withdrawalof government support of airline war-risk insurance wouldrequire us to obtain war-risk insurance coverage commercially,if available. Such commercial insurance could have substantiallyless desirable coverage than currently provided by theU.S. government, may not be adequate to protect our risk ofloss from future acts of terrorism, may result in a materialincrease to our operating expenses or may not be obtainable atall, resulting in an interruption to our operations"
