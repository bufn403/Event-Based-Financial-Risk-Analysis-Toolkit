      The following important risk factors, and those risk factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report or in our other filings with the SEC, could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results. We also refer you to the factors and cautionary language set forth in the section entitled “Cautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” above. All of the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes, should be read in conjunction with the discussion of such risks, cautionary statements and other factors for a full understanding of our operations and financial conditions. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The following risks are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.Risks Related to our Business and OperationsOur fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reduce the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.Another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in demand and/or resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.We obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.Over the last twenty years, we have purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chains. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties, government regulations or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders from U-Haul or fulfill existing orders. In addition, the cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.A significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.Our business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.  As of March 31, 2023 we had nearly 21,300 independent equipment rental dealers.  In fiscal 2023, just under half of all U-Move® rental revenue originated through this network.Our inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.The introduction or expansion of laws or regulations favoring electric, autonomous, connected and shared vehicles may negatively impact our business and results of operations.Regulatory pressure in connection with the introduction and expansion of electric, autonomous and connected rental vehicles could negatively impact our ability to acquire, or our cost of acquisition for rental trucks and require infrastructure improvements that could inhibit our current business model.  Our Company-operated locations and independent dealer network may require physical upgrades to accommodate these types of vehicles that are uneconomical and/or unachievable.  Our one-way rental business would depend on an in-transit recharging network throughout the United States and Canada that simply does not exist today, and that, if and when completed, may be so costly or require so much charging time as to substantially limit our ability to serve customers needing to move long distances. 8 We cooperate with original equipment manufacturers (“OEM“s), maintain and train our own technical experts and operate an equipment Technical Center that has positioned us as an industry leader in innovation for over fifty years.  However, the proposed changes to electric, autonomous and connected vehicles raises challenges of enormous scale. Our repair and maintenance infrastructures, including both physical plants as well as personnel, may be inappropriate for these new types of vehicles.  Without such repair and maintenance capabilities it could compromise our ability to operate a fleet of such vehicles.  We may also need to depend upon third party providers for some of those services, and they may not be able to provide workable solutions. There is a risk that we may not be able to adequately prepare for these possibilities. In addition, even if we successfully adapt to any such changes, there can be no guarantee that our fleet or services as adapted would meet the needs of our “do-it-yourself“ moving and storage customers, or that we would be able to offer our products and services at prices our customers would be willing or able to pay.The growing insistence that the future of the economy will be based on an all-electric solution instead of a hybrid version or other alternative fuels may create an infrastructure in which personal interstate travel will be uneconomical or severely regulated.  This would impact the moving business.  There may be areas of North America where a charging grid with adequate capacity for our customers may not exist.U-Haul has already made significant progress on several initiatives aimed at these future possibilities including: TruckShare 24/7®, contactless rentals, a North American propane alternative fuel network, alternative fuel test vehicles and close OEM working relationships. However, these initiatives may not enable us to successfully adapt to the requirements of a changed regulatory environment favoring or requiring all-electric or specific alternative fuel solutions. Government regulators may knowingly or unknowingly choose the winners and losers in this evolving transportation environment.  There remains a possibility that governments may not select U-Haul customers and U-Haul to be among the winners.We face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.  The business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death. Likewise, the operation of our moving and storage centers along with the sale of our related moving supplies, towing accessories and installation, and refilling of propane tanks may subject us to liability claims.  We seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use, exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules, extensive training of our personnel, proactive risk management assessments and by providing our customers with online resources for the proper use of products and services.  Regardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss and property insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.  While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.  We have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.  However, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and inflict reputational damage. In addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, system members and others. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, or catastrophic events. Hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or ransom or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business and access to our data.  In addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not 9  recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the Company. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches may not be successful.In 2022 and 2021, we experienced a cybersecurity incident which is described in this Annual Report under the headings “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Cybersecurity Incident”.We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ or counterparties’ failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.As of December 31, 2022, Repwest reported $0.4 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $41.3 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest’s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $26.3 million.Risks Related to our IndustryWe operate in a highly competitive industry.The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors, many of which are several times larger than U-Haul. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Numerous potential competitors are working to establish paradigm shifting technologies from self-driving vehicles to ride-hailing services and other technologies that connect riders with vehicles.The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material effect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. Consolidation of ownership is taking place with certain owners of self-storage. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets.  10 Economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, interest rates and inflation, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.Consumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  We cannot predict if another downturn in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.Trends in the economy are resulting in inflationary pressures leading to an increase in our cost of doing business. We cannot guarantee that we can manage the costs lower or pass them along in the form of higher prices to our customers.Should credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails or opts not to continue to lend to us, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  If our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In August 2022, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating (“FSR”) for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) of A. The FSR outlook remains stable. In addition, A.M. Best affirmed the long-term issuer credit rating (“LTICR”) of “a”. The LTICR outlook of these ratings is stable. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to our FinancingsWe are highly leveraged.As of March 31, 2023, we had total debt outstanding of $6,143.4 million and operating lease liabilities of $58.4 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and lease payments;limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;limit our ability to obtain additional financing; andplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.Our ability to make payments on our debt and leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and leases. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness. 11 Risks Related to our OrganizationA majority of our Voting Common Stock is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.Willow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities (“WGHLP”), owns 9,791,911 shares of our common stock, $0.25 par value per share (“Voting Common Stock”), and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 9,828,542 shares (approximately 50.1%) of Voting Common Stock. The general partner of WGHLP controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the Voting Common Stock owned by WGHLP, and is managed by Edward J. Shoen (the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of U-Haul Holding Company) and his brother, Mark V. Shoen. Accordingly, Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business and policies, including the approval of certain significant transactions, the election of the members of our board of directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Furthermore, we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance standards. Under these corporate governance standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a “ controlled company ” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance standards, including the requirements (1) that a majority of our Board consist of independent directors, (2) that our Board have a compensation committee that consists entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, and (3) that our director nominations be made, or recommended to our full Board, by our independent directors or by a nominations committee that consists entirely of independent directors and that we adopt a written charter or board resolution addressing the nomination process. The Company has not made any election relating to compliance with any of these corporate governance standards. In addition, 836,228 shares (approximately 4.3%) of our Voting Common Stock are owned under our ESOP.  Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.  In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee’s discretion.  The trading price for our outstanding Voting Common Stock may continue to be volatile and the trading price for our newly distributed Series N Non-Voting Common Stock may also be volatile.An Independent Special Committee of the Board authorized the creation of a new Series of Common Stock, designated as Series N Non-Voting Common Stock, par value of $0.001 per share (the “Non-Voting Common Stock”). This series of stock is in addition to our pre-existing class of Voting Common Stock. On November 9, 2022, each holder of our Voting Common Stock as of November 3, 2022 received nine shares of Non-Voting Common Stock for every outstanding share of Voting Common Stock through a stock dividend.  The Non-Voting Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, a liquid trading market will develop long-term for the Non-Voting Common Stock. If a liquid trading market does not develop or if the Non-Voting Common Stock is not attractive to retail investors, including team members and customers of the Company, we may not achieve our objectives in creating this new class.The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile, including as a result of the distribution of shares of Non-Voting Common Stock. The market prices of our two series of stock and the allocation of value between the two may be volatile and their respective values may decline. The trading price of our Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:•                     Quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.•                     Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.•                     Recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.•                     Announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.•                     Announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations. 12 •                     Commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.•                     The volume of shares of Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock available for public sale.•                     Sales of Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).•                     Short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock.•                     The perceived values of Voting Common Stock and Non-Voting Common Stock relative to one another. Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and ComplianceOur operations subject us to numerous environmental laws and regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state, provincial and local governments in the United States and Canada affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 19, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these compliance efforts, the risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these laws and regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing laws and regulations or violations of existing or future laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Our truck, trailer and U-Box rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and provincial governmental entities in the United States and Canada. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety, among other matters. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing laws and regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon individual entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their businesses.The Biden administration has also communicated its willingness to consider the imposition of carbon-based taxes.  Our truck rental fleet burns gasoline, a carbon intensive fuel.  Where in the supply chain and in what amount these taxes could arise is uncertain.  We have no evidence to support a belief that “do-it-yourself” moving customers are willing to accept these additional costs.  Should such a tax be enacted, we could see an increase in expenses, including compliance costs and a negative effect on our operating margin. 13 Our operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.Our insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.Recent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours.  For instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Reform Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.  It also limits interest expense deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures. Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally. The CARES Act allows for the carryback of certain net operating losses. The Tax Reform Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), as well as state tax authorities, and the Tax Reform Act and CARES Act could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of these acts. The Tax Reform Act put into place 100% first year bonus depreciation. This decreased to 80% starting in 2023 and will continue to gradually decrease in future years and will impact our tax liability. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes was complex, and some of the changes affected both current and future periods.  Others primarily affected future periods.  Additional changes to the U.S. tax code could negatively offset operating cashflows.Changes to tax policy, corporate tax rates or interpretations of existing tax law could change our effective tax rate, reduce future expected tax deductions and increase current and future federal income tax payments.  Congress and the Biden administration have proposed increases to the current U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%.  Any such changes could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.General Risk Factors
Terrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.  Such attacks may damage our facilities and it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.  Although we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.  Moreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.  We seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations"

      The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere. 7 Risks Related to our Business and OperationsOur fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment.

Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material effect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets. Economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, interest rates and inflation, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.Consumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  We cannot predict if another downturn in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.Trends in the economy could result in inflationary pressures leading to an increase in our cost of doing business. We cannot guarantee that we can manage the costs lower or pass them along in the form of higher prices to our customers.Should credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails or opts not to continue to lend to us, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  If our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems 10  that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In July 2021, A.M. Best upgraded the financial strength rating (“FSR”) for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) to A from A-. The FSR outlook remains stable. In addition, A.M. Best upgraded the long-term issuer credit rating (“LTICR”) to “a” from “a-“. The LTICR outlook has been revised to stable from positive. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to our FinancingsWe are highly leveraged.As of March 31, 2022, we had total debt outstanding of $6,022.5 million and operating lease liabilities of $74.2 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and lease payments;limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;limit our ability to obtain additional financing; andplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.Our ability to make payments on our debt and leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and leases. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.Uncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely impact our indebtedness under our credit and loan facilities.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.  In addition, in April 2018, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, announced the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short-term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.  In November 2020 the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other groups announced that LIBOR reporting will cease being published in June 2023. In March 2022, Congress passed the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act. It provides protection for contracts without workable fallback provisions. The act also provides safe-harbor provisions to shield parties from liability under potential lawsuits due to the transition away from LIBOR. Potential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the market for LIBOR-based securities, including our portfolio of LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities, or the cost of our borrowings. In addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based securities, including the value of the LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio, or the cost of our borrowings. We have already been renegotiating our LIBOR-indexed debt and will continue to do so.  The potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined. 11 Risks Related to our OrganizationA substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.Willow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities (“WGHLP”), owns 8,433,207 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,469,826 shares (approximately 43.2%) of AMERCO common stock.  The general partner of WGHLP controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the common stock of AMERCO owned by WGHLP, and is managed by Edward J. Shoen (the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of AMERCO) and his brother, Mark V. Shoen.  Accordingly, Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business and policies, including the approval of certain significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, 889,525 shares (approximately 4.5%) of AMERCO common stock are owned under our ESOP.  Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.  In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee’s discretion.  Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and ComplianceOur operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 18, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these compliance efforts, the risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon individual entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their businesses. 12 The Biden administration has communicated its willingness to consider the imposition of carbon-based taxes.  Our truck rental fleet burns gasoline, a carbon intensive fuel.  Where in the supply chain and in what amount these taxes could arise is uncertain.  We have no evidence to support a belief that “do-it-yourself” moving customers are willing to accept these additional costs.  Should such a tax be enacted, we could see an increase in expenses, including compliance costs and a negative effect on our operating margin.Our operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.Our insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.Recent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours.  For instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Reform Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.  It also limits interest expense deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures. Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally. The CARES Act allows for the carryback of certain net operating losses. The Tax Reform Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), as well as state tax authorities, and the Tax Reform Act and CARES Act could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of these acts. The Tax Reform Act put into place 100% first year bonus depreciation. This will begin to gradually decrease starting in 2023 and will impact our tax liability. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes was complex, and some of the changes affected both current and future periods.  Others primarily affected future periods.  Additional changes to the U.S. tax code could negatively offset operating cashflows.Changes to tax policy, corporate tax rates or interpretations of existing tax law could change our effective tax rate, reduce future expected tax deductions and increase current and future federal income tax payments.  Congress and the Biden administration have proposed increases to the current U.S. corporate income tax rate of 21%.  Any such changes could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.General Risk Factors
Terrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.  Such attacks may damage our facilities and it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.  Although we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.  Moreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.  We seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations"
10,UHAL,AMERCO,2021-05-26,"Risk Factors
      The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.7 The recent COVID-19 global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Future viral pandemics could have similar or more severe effects on our business. In late 2019, COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Early on the virus, along with mitigation measures, adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets.  The combination of customer-initiated changes in behavior, along with state and local jurisdictions imposing shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in reduced business activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2021.  These events have highlighted several risks to our business resulting from COVID-19 or other potential future pandemics.Our locations are considered essential services and have been open and serving communities throughout the current pandemic. There is a risk this may not always be the case.  Additionally, our workforce may be negatively impacted by such a pandemic that could lead to disruptions in our ability to serve customers.  We are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 or other such similar outbreaks will have on our operations going forward due to uncertainties which will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration of COVID-19 and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic. It is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments.  For the fiscal year, we saw our first quarter results negatively impacted while our second, third and fourth quarter results showed improvement.  There remains uncertainty as to the potential materiality in fiscal 2022. To the extent COVID-19  adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, our fleet rotation program, the manufacturers and suppliers of our rental equipment, our independent dealers and the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.We operate in a highly competitive industry.The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors, many of which are several times larger than U-Haul. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Numerous potential competitors are working to establish paradigm shifting technologies from self-driving vehicles to ride-hailing services and other technologies that connect riders with vehicles.The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material effect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets. 8 We are highly leveraged.As of March 31, 2021, we had total debt outstanding of $4,698.6 million and operating lease liabilities of $92.5 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and lease payments;limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;limit our ability to obtain additional financing; andplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.Our ability to make payments on our debt and leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and leases. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.Uncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely impact our indebtedness under our credit and loan facilities.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.  In addition, in April 2018, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, announced the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short-term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement.  In November 2020 the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other groups announced that LIBOR reporting will cease being published in June 2023.  Potential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the market for LIBOR-based securities, including our portfolio of LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities, or the cost of our borrowings. In addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based securities, including the value of the LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio, or the cost of our borrowings. We believe our LIBOR-indexed debt maturing after June 2023 will need to be renegotiated.  The potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined.Economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.Consumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  We cannot predict if another downturn in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.Trends in the economy could result in inflationary pressures leading to an increase in our cost of doing business. We cannot guarantee that we can manage the costs lower or pass them along in the form of higher prices to our customers.9 Should credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails or opts not to continue to lend to us, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  If our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reduce the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.Another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in demand and/or resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.We obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.Over the last twenty years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. The cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.A substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.Willow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities (“WGHLP”), owns 8,342,849 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,390,138 shares (approximately 42.8%) of AMERCO common stock.  The general partner of WGHLP controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the common stock of AMERCO owned by WGHLP, and is managed by Edward J. Shoen (the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of AMERCO) and his brother, Mark V. Shoen.  Accordingly, Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business and policies, including the approval of certain significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, 951,188 shares (approximately 4.9%) of AMERCO common stock are owned under our ESOP.  Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.  In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee's discretion.  10 Our operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances.

Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.Our insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.A significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.Our business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.  As of March 31, 2021 we had nearly 21,100 independent equipment rental dealers.  In fiscal 2021, less than half of all U-Move® rental revenue originated through this network.Our inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.11 The introduction or expansion of regulations favoring electric, autonomous, connected and shared vehicles may negatively impact our business and results of operations.Regulatory pressure in connection with the introduction and expansion of electric, autonomous and connected rental vehicles could negatively impact our cost of acquisition for rental trucks and require infrastructure improvements that could inhibit our current business model.  Our Company operated-locations and independent dealer network may require physical upgrades to accommodate these types of vehicles that are uneconomical and/or unachievable.  Our one-way rental business would depend on an in-transit recharging network that simply does not exist today, and when completed, may be so costly or require so much charging time as to substantially limit our ability to serve customers needing to move long distances.Our repair and maintenance infrastructures, including both physical plant as well as personnel, may be inappropriate for these new types of vehicles.  Without such maintenance capabilities it could compromise our ability to operate such a fleet of compliant vehicles.  There is risk inherent in our ability to prepare for these possibilities.We cooperate with original equipment manufacturers (“OEM“s), maintain and train our own technical experts and operate an equipment Technical Center that has positioned us as an industry leader in innovation for over fifty years.  The proposed changes to electric, autonomous and connected vehicles raises challenges of enormous scale.  We necessarily may also be dependent upon third party providers who may not be able to provide workable solutions.The growing insistence that the future of the economy will be based on an all-electric solution instead of a hybrid version or other alternative fuels may create an infrastructure in which personal interstate travel will be uneconomical or severely regulated.  This would impact the moving business.  There may be areas of North America where a charging grid with adequate capacity for our customers may not exist.U-Haul has already made significant progress on several initiatives aimed at these future possibilities including: TruckShare 24/7, contactless rentals, a North American propane alternative fuel network, alternative fuel test vehicles and close OEM working relationships.  Government regulators may knowingly or unknowingly choose the winners and losers in this evolving transportation environment.  There remains a possibility that governments may not select U-Haul customers and U-Haul to be among the winners.We face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.  The business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death. Likewise, the operation of our moving and storage centers along with the sale of our related moving supplies, towing accessories and installation, and refilling of propane tanks may subject us to liability claims.  We seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use, exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules, extensive training of our personnel, proactive risk management assessments and by providing our customers with online resources for the proper use of products and services.  Regardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss and property insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.Terrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.  Such attacks may damage our facilities and it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.  Although we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.  Moreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.  We seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations.12 We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.  While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.  We have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.  However, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and inflict reputational damage. In addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, system members and others. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, or catastrophic events. Hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or ransom or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business and access to our data.  In addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the Company. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches may not be successful.A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In July 2020, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) of A- and affirmed the outlook is positive and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (“NAI”) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford's business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford's ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur losses due to our reinsurers' or counterparties' failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.As of December 31, 2020, Repwest reported $0.3 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $64.9 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest's largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $39.4 million.13 Recent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours.  For instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Reform Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.  It also limits interest expense deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures. Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally. The CARES Act allows for the carryback of certain net operating losses. The Tax Reform Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities, and the Tax Reform Act and CARES Act could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of these acts. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes was complex, and some of the changes affected both current and future periods.  Others primarily affected future periods.  Additional changes to the U.S. tax code could negatively offset operating cashflows"

      The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.The recent novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Future viral pandemics could have similar or more severe effects on our business. In late 2019, COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, and governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The virus, along with measures have adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets.  The combination of customer-initiated changes in behavior along with state and local jurisdictions imposing shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in reduced business activity.  These events have highlighted several risks to our business resulting from COVID-19 or other potential future pandemics.Our locations are considered essential services and have been open and serving communities throughout the current pandemic. There is a risk this may not always be the case.  Additionally, our workforce may be negatively impacted by such a pandemic that could lead to disruptions in our ability to serve customers.  We are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 or other such similar outbreaks will have on our operations going forward due to uncertainties which will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue, which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration of COVID-19 and the impact of governmental regulations that might be imposed in response to the pandemic. While it is premature to accurately predict the ultimate impact of these developments, we suspect that our results for the quarter ending June 30, 2020 and potentially the remainder of fiscal 2021 may be significantly adversely affected.To the extent COVID-19  adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, our fleet rotation program, the manufacturers and suppliers of our rental equipment, our independent dealers and the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.7  We operate in a highly competitive industry.The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Numerous potential competitors are working to establish paradigm shifting technologies from self-driving vehicles to ride-hailing services and other technologies that connect riders with vehicles.The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material effect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets. We are highly leveraged.As of March 31, 2020, we had total debt outstanding of $4,651.1 million and operating lease liabilities of $106.4 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and lease payments;limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;limit our ability to obtain additional financing; andplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.Our ability to make payments on our debt and leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and leases. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.8  Uncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely impact our indebtedness under our credit and loan facilities.On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates London Inter-Bank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. In addition, in April 2018, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, announced the replacement of LIBOR with a new index, calculated by short-term repurchase agreements collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement. Additionally, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. Potential changes, or uncertainty related to such potential changes, may adversely affect the market for LIBOR-based securities, including our portfolio of LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities, or the cost of our borrowings. In addition, changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market for LIBOR-based securities, including the value of the LIBOR-indexed, floating-rate debt securities in our portfolio, or the cost of our borrowings. Additionally, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit and loan facilities extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate and certain of our existing credit facilities to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. The potential effect of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined. Economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.Consumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  We cannot predict if another downturn in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.Should credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails or opts not to continue to lend to us, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  If our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reduce the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.Another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in demand and/or resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.9  We obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.Over the last twenty years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. The cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.A substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.Willow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities (“WGHLP”), owns 8,337,804 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,390,066 shares (approximately 42.8%) of AMERCO common stock.  The general partner of WGHLP controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the common stock of AMERCO owned by WGHLP, and is managed by Edward J. Shoen (the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of AMERCO) and his brother, Mark V. Shoen.  Accordingly, Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business and policies, including the approval of certain significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, 1,003,040 shares (approximately 5.1%) of AMERCO common stock are owned under our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”).  Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.  In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee’s discretion.  Our operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 19, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these compliance efforts, the risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.10  We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon individual entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their businesses.Our operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.Our insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.A significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.Our business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.  As of March 31, 2020 we had over 20,100 independent equipment rental dealers.  In fiscal 2020, less than half of all U-Move® rental revenue originated through this network.Our inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.We face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.  The business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death. Likewise, the operation of our moving and storage centers along with the sale of our related moving supplies, towing accessories and installation, and refilling of propane tanks may subject us to liability claims.  We seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use, exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules, extensive training of our personnel, proactive risk management assessments and by providing our customers with online resources for the proper use of products and services.  Regardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss and property insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.Terrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.  Such attacks may damage our facilities and it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.  Although we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.  Moreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.  We seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations.11  We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.  While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.  We have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.  However, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and inflict reputational damage. In addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, or catastrophic events. Hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or ransom or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business and access to our data.  In addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the Company. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches may not be successful.A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In June 2019, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) of A- and revised the outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (“NAI”) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ or counterparties’ failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.At December 31, 2019, Repwest reported $0.6 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $87.1 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest’s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $54.5 million.12  Recent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours.  For instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Reform Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.  It also limits interest expense deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures. Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally. The CARES Act allows for the carryback of certain net operating losses. The Tax Reform Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the Tax Reform Act and CARES Act could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of these acts. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes was complex, and some of the changes affected both current and future periods.  Others primarily affected future periods.  As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, our analysis and computations of the tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on us was complete as of December 22, 2018"

The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.We operate in a highly competitive industry.The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. Numerous potential competitors are working to establish paradigm shifting technologies from self-driving vehicles to ride-hailing services and other technologies that connect riders with vehicles.The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities.

The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets. We are highly leveraged.As of March 31, 2019, we had total debt outstanding of $4,210.2 million and total undiscounted operating and ground lease commitments of $148.0 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and lease payments;limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;limit our ability to obtain additional financing; andplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.7   Our ability to make payments on our debt and leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and leases. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.

We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.9   We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon individual entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their businesses.Our operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.Our insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.A significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.Our business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.  As of March 31, 2019 we had over 20,000 independent equipment rental dealers.  In fiscal 2019, less than half of all U-Move® rental revenue originated through this network.Our inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.We face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.  The business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death. Likewise, the operation of our moving and storage centers along with the sale of our related moving supplies, towing accessories and installation, and refilling of propane tanks may subject us to liability claims.  We seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use, exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules, extensive training of our personnel, proactive risk management assessments and by providing our customers with online resources for the proper use of products and services.  Regardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.Terrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.  Such attacks may damage our facilities and it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.  Although we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.  Moreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.  We seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations. 10   We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.  While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.  We have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.  However, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and inflict reputational damage. In addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, or catastrophic events. Hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or ransom or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business and access to our data.  In addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the Company. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches may not be successful.A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In June 2018, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) of A- with a stable outlook and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (“NAI”) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ or counterparties’ failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.At December 31, 2018, Repwest reported $2.3 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $94.9 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest’s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $60.6 million.11   Recent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”) made significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours.  For instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Reform Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.  It also limits interest expense deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures.  Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally. The Tax Reform Act is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the IRS, as well as state tax authorities, and the Tax Reform Act could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of the Tax Reform Act. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes was complex, and some of the changes affected both current and future periods.  Others primarily affected future periods.  As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, our analysis and computations of the tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on us was complete as of December 22, 2018"
13,UHAL,AMERCO,2018-05-30,"Risk Factors
The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.We operate in a highly competitive industry.The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations. Numerous potential competitors are working to establish paradigm shifting technologies from self driving vehicles to Uber-like offerings.The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material affect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets. We are highly leveraged.As of March 31, 2018, we had total debt outstanding of $3,538.7 million and total undiscounted operating and ground lease commitments of $165.9 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and lease payments;limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;limit our ability to obtain additional financing; andplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.7   Our ability to make payments on our debt and leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness and leases. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.Economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.Consumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  We cannot predict if another downturn in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.Should credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  If our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reduce the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.Another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in demand and/or resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.We obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.Over the last twenty years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. The cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.8   We may not be able to effectively hedge against interest rate changes in our variable debt.In certain instances, the Company seeks to manage its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of hedging instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Additionally, a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to record these financial instruments at their fair value. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact the valuation of the instruments resulting in non-cash changes to our financial position.A substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.Willow Grove Holdings LP, directly and through controlled entities (“WGHLP”), owns 8,309,584 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,361,643 shares (approximately 42.6%) of AMERCO common stock.  The general partner of WGHLP controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the common stock of AMERCO owned by WGHLP, and is managed by Edward J. Shoen (the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of AMERCO) and his brother, Mark V. Shoen.  Accordingly, Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business and policies, including the approval of certain significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, 1,143,609 shares (approximately 5.8%) of AMERCO common stock are owned under our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”).  Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.  In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee’s discretion.  Our quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with our industry.Our business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter is generally weakest, due to a greater potential for adverse weather conditions and other factors that are not necessarily seasonal. As a result, our operating results for any given quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.Our operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 18, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these compliance efforts, the risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.9   We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon individual entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their businesses.Our operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.Our insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases. A significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.Our business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.  As of March 31, 2018 we had approximately 20,000 independent equipment rental dealers.  In fiscal 2018, approximately 45% of our equipment rental revenues were generated through this network.We manage 482 U-Haul branded locations on behalf of subsidiaries of WGHLP and Mercury Partners, L.P. (“Mercury”). These locations generated $29.6 million of management fees in fiscal 2018. Additionally, these locations served as U-Haul equipment dealers and accounted for approximately 12% of our equipment rental revenues in fiscal 2018.Our inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.We face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet, sales of our products and operation of our locations.  The business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death. Likewise, the operation of our moving and storage centers along with the sale of our related moving supplies, towing accessories and installation, and refilling of propane tanks may subject us to liability claims.  We seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use, exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules, extensive training of our personnel, proactive risk management assessments and by providing our customers with online resources for the proper use of products and services.  Regardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.10   Terrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.  Such attacks may damage our facilities and it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.  Although we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.  Moreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.  We seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations.Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and changes in laws or other labor issues could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.The success of our business is predicated upon our workforce providing excellent customer service. Our ability to attract and retain this employee base may be inhibited due to prevailing wage rates, benefit costs and the adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Should this occur we may be unable to provide service in certain areas or we may experience significantly increased costs of labor that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.  While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.  We have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.  However, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and inflict reputational damage. In addition, the provision of service to our customers and the operation of our networks and systems involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, malicious insiders, or catastrophic events. Hackers, acting individually or in coordinated groups, may also launch distributed denial of service attacks or ransom or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages or other interruptions in our business and access to our data.  In addition, breaches in security could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any of these occurrences could result in disruptions in our operations, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, and litigation and potential liability for the Company. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measures could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches may not be successful.A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In June 2017, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) of A- with a stable outlook and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (“NAI”) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 11   We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ or counterparties’ failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage.

Of this, Repwest’s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $57.5 million.Recent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.The Tax Reform Act makes significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours.  For instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the Tax Reform Act tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities.  It also limits interest rate deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures.  Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally.

The accounting treatment of these tax law changes is complex, and some of the changes may affect both current and future periods.  Others will primarily affect future periods.  As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe our analysis and computations of the tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on us is substantially, but not entirely, complete. Consistent with guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission, our financial statements reflect our estimates of the tax effects of the Tax Reform Act on us. "

The general partner of Willow Grove is Foster Road, LLC (“Foster Road”). Foster Road controls the voting and disposition decisions with respect to the AMERCO common stock owned by Willow Grove and is owned and managed by Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen. Accordingly, Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, brothers, are in a position to significantly influence our business and policies, including the approval of certain significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. In addition, 1,180,744 shares (approximately 6.0%) of AMERCO common stock is owned under our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”).  Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.  In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee’s discretion.  8   We bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SAC Holdings.At March 31, 2017, we held a $48.1 million note receivable from SAC Holdings, which consists of a junior unsecured note. SAC Holdings is highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holdings is unable to meet its obligations to its senior lenders, it could trigger a default of its obligation to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holdings is inadequate to repay its senior lenders and our junior unsecured note. We cannot assure you that SAC Holdings will not default on its loans to their senior lenders or that the value of its assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full. Our quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with our industry.Our business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter is generally weakest, due to a greater potential for adverse weather conditions and other factors that are not necessarily seasonal. As a result, our operating results for any given quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.Our operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 18, Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these compliance efforts, we believe that risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state, federal and Canadian agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon individual entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their businesses.Our operations can be limited by land-use regulations. Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities in the United States and Canada may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.9   Our insurance companies are heavily regulated by state insurance departments and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”). These insurance regulations are primarily in place to protect the interests of our policyholders and not our investors. Changes in these laws and regulations could increase our costs, inhibit new sales, or limit our ability to implement rate increases.A significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.Our business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically located throughout the United States and Canada.  As of March 31, 2017 we had approximately 20,000 independent equipment rental dealers.  In fiscal 2017, approximately 46% of our equipment rental revenues were generated through this network.Our inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.We face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet.  The business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death.  We seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use and exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules.  Regardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers. While these excess loss insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.Terrorist attacks could negatively impact our operations and profitability and may expose us to liability and reputational damage.Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations and profitability.  Such attacks may damage our facilities or it is also possible that our rental equipment could be involved in a terrorist attack.  Although we carry excess of loss insurance coverage, it may prove to be insufficient to cover us for acts of terror using our rental equipment.  Moreover, we may suffer reputational damage that could arise from a terrorist attack which utilizes our rental equipment. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities are unpredictable and difficult to quantify.  We seek to minimize these risks through our operational processes and procedures; however, we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations.Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and changes in laws or other labor issues could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.The success of our business is predicated upon our workforce providing excellent customer service. Our ability to attract and retain this employee base may be inhibited due to prevailing wage rates, benefit costs and the adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Should this occur we may be unable to provide service in certain areas or we may experience significantly increased costs of labor that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.  While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters, terrorist attacks and cyber-attacks.  We have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.  However, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, inflict reputational damage, result in litigation with third parties and resulting governmental investigations and penalties.10   A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In May 2016, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) of A- with a stable outlook and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (“NAI”) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ or counterparties’ failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.At December 31, 2016, Repwest reported $0.5 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $104.0 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest’s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $60.6 million"

The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.6   We operate in a highly competitive industry.The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations.The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material affect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets. We are highly leveraged.As of March 31, 2016, we had total debt outstanding of $2,688.8 million and total undiscounted operating lease commitments of $157.0 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service and operating lease payments;limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;limit our ability to obtain additional financing; andplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.Our ability to make payments on our debt and operating leases depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, including our operating leases, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt or leases that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.Economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.Consumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our businesses, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines, or sustained lack of recovery, in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  We cannot predict if another downturn, or sustained lack of recovery, in the economy will occur, which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.7   Should credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly, we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  If our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reduce the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.Another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in demand and/or resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.We obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.Over the last twenty years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. The cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.We may not be able to effectively hedge against interest rate changes in our variable debt.In certain instances, the Company seeks to manage its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of hedging instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Additionally, a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to record these financial instruments at their fair value. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact the valuation of the instruments resulting in non-cash changes to our financial position.A substantial amount of our shares is owned by a small contingent of stockholders.Willow Grove Holdings LP, James P. Shoen, David L. Holmes as trustee, Rosemarie T. Donovan as trustee, Mark V. Shoen and Edward J. Shoen, directly and through controlled entities as applicable (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”) are parties to a stockholder agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”) in which the Reporting Persons have agreed to vote their collective 10,898,124 shares (approximately 55.6%) of AMERCO common stock as one group, as provided in the Stockholder Agreement.  Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, all such 10,898,124 shares are required to be voted at the direction of a majority in interest of the Reporting Persons.  For additional information, refer to the Schedule 13Ds filed on July 13, 2006, March 9, 2007, June 26, 2009, May 1, 2013, December 17, 2015 and on February 12, 2016 with the SEC. 8   In December 2015, each of James P. Shoen, Rosemarie Donovan as trustee, and David L. Holmes as trustee provided written notice that they intend to withdraw their shares, constituting a total of 2,538,622 shares, from the Stockholder Agreement on June 30, 2016. James P. Shoen, Rosemarie T. Donovan and David L. Holmes shall remain subject to the Stockholder Agreement until the effective date of such withdrawal, which is expected to occur before our next annual meeting of stockholders. The withdrawal of such shares from the Stockholder Agreement will result in us no longer being a “controlled company” pursuant to the Nasdaq listing rules as of July 1, 2016. However, Willow Grove Holdings, LP, directly and through controlled entities, owns 8,307,584 shares of AMERCO common stock, and together with Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, owns 8,359,502 shares (approximately 42.6%) of AMERCO common stock.  Accordingly, Edward J. Shoen and Mark V. Shoen, brothers, are in a position to significantly influence our business and policies, including the approval of certain significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.In addition, 1,232,753 shares (approximately 6.3%) of AMERCO common stock is owned under our Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”).  Each ESOP participant is entitled to vote the shares allocated to himself or herself in their discretion.  In the event an ESOP participant does not vote his or her shares, such shares shall be voted by the ESOP trustee, in the ESOP trustee’s discretion.  We bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SAC Holding.At March 31, 2016, we held a $49.3 million note receivable from SAC Holding, which consists of a junior unsecured note. This entity is highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holding is unable to meet its obligations to its senior lenders, it could trigger a default of its obligation to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holding is inadequate to repay its senior lenders and our junior unsecured note. We cannot assure you that SAC Holding will not default on its loans to their senior lenders or that the value of its assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full.

Holmes (Successor Trustee of the Irrevocable “C” Trusts) (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”) are parties to a stockholder agreement dated, June 30, 2006, in which the Reporting Persons agreed to vote as one as provided in the agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”).  Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, a collective 10,897,889 shares (approximately 55.6%) of the Company’s common stock are voted at the direction of a majority in interest of the Reporting Persons.  For additional information, refer to the Schedule 13Ds filed on July 13, 2006, March 9, 2007, June 26, 2009 and on May 1, 2013 with the SEC. In addition, 1,287,968 shares (approximately 6.6%) of the outstanding common stock of AMERCO are held by our Employee Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Trust.  8 As a result of their stock ownership and the Stockholder Agreement, Edward J. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen and James P. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business affairs and policies of the Company, including the approval of significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that the interests of the Reporting Persons will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of the Reporting Persons’ voting power, the Company is a “controlled company” as defined in the Nasdaq Listing Rules and, therefore, may avail itself of certain exemptions under the Nasdaq rules, regarding having a majority of independent directors and independent director oversight of executive compensation and director nominations.We bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SAC Holding and Private Mini.At March 31, 2015, we held $106.9 million of notes receivable from SAC Holding and Private Mini Storage Realty, L.P. (“Private Mini”), which consist of junior unsecured notes. These entities are highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holding or Private Mini are unable to meet their obligations to their senior lenders, it could trigger a default of their obligations to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holding and Private Mini is inadequate to repay their senior lenders and our junior unsecured notes. We cannot assure you that SAC Holding or Private Mini will not default on their loans to their senior lenders or that the value of their assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full. Our quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with our industry.Our business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter is generally weakest, due to a greater potential for adverse weather conditions and other factors that are not necessarily seasonal. As a result, our operating results for any given quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.Our operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 18, Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these compliance efforts, we believe that risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  9 We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state and federal agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their industries.Our operations can be limited by land-use regulations.  Zoning choices enacted by individual municipalities across North America may limit our ability to serve certain markets with our products and services.A significant portion of our revenues are generated through third-parties.Our business plan relies upon a network of independent dealers strategically placed throughout North America.  As of March 31, 2015 we had approximately 18,200 independent equipment rental dealers.  In fiscal 2015, approximately 46% of our equipment rental revenues were generated through this network.Our inability to maintain this network or its current cost structure could inhibit our ability to adequately serve our customers and may negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.We face liability risks associated with the operation of our rental fleet.  The business of renting moving and storage equipment to customers exposes us to liability claims including property damage, personal injury and even death.  We seek to limit the occurrence of such events through the design of our equipment, communication of its proper use and exhaustive repair and maintenance schedules.  Regardless, accidents still occur and we manage the financial risk of these events through third party insurance carriers.   While these excess loss insurance policies are available today at reasonable costs, this could change and could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position.Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and changes in laws or other labor issues could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.The success of our business is predicated upon our workforce providing excellent customer service. Our ability to attract and retain this employee base may be inhibited due to prevailing wage rates, benefit costs and the adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Should this occur we may be unable to provide service in certain areas or we may experience significantly increased costs of labor that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system, payment processing and telephone systems.  While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to better serve customers, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters and cyber-attacks.  We have put into place extensive security protocols, backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate these risks.  However, disruptions or breaches, detected or undetected by us, for any period of time in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, inflict reputational damage and result in litigation with third parties.  10 A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In May 2015, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford and Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) to A- with a stable outlook and affirmed the financial strength rating for North American Insurance Company (“NAI”) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ or counterparties’ failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for Moving and Storage. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.At December 31, 2014, Repwest reported $1.7 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $120.9 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest’s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $61.5 million"

The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.We operate in a highly competitive industry.The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations.The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material affect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets. We are highly leveraged.As of March 31, 2014, we had total debt outstanding of $1,942.4 million and total undiscounted operating lease commitments of $145.5 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: •            require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service payments;•            limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•            limit our ability to obtain additional financing; and•            place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.7 Our ability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.Economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.The United States economy has undergone a period of slowdown and unprecedented volatility, which resulted in a recession.  It is difficult to gauge the pace of the economic recovery or if such recovery may stall or reverse course in the future.  Consumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control. Our industries, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines, or sustained lack of recovery, in general economic conditions. In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  We cannot predict if another downturn, or sustained lack of recovery, in the economy may occur which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.Should credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  If our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Our fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reducing the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations.Another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which could result in substantial losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.We obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.Over the last twenty years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. The cost of acquiring new rental trucks could increase materially and negatively affect our ability to rotate new equipment into the fleet. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time.8 We may not be able to effectively hedge against interest rate changes in our variable debt.In certain instances, the Company seeks to manage its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of hedging instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Additionally, a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to record these financial instruments at their fair value. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact the valuation of the instruments resulting in non-cash changes to our financial position.We are controlled by a small contingent of stockholders.As of March 31, 2014, Edward J. Shoen, President and Chairman of the Board of AMERCO, James P. Shoen, a director of AMERCO, and Mark V. Shoen collectively are the owners of 9,139,075 shares (approximately 46.6%) of the outstanding common stock of AMERCO. In addition, Edward J. Shoen, James P. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen, Rosmarie T. Donovan (Trustee of the Shoen Irrevocable Trusts) and David L. Holmes (Successor Trustee of the Irrevocable “C” Trusts) (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”) are parties to a stockholder agreement dated June 30, 2006 in which the Reporting Persons agreed to vote as one as provided in the agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”).  Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, a collective 10,897,798 shares (approximately 55.6%) of the Company’s common stock are voted at the direction of a majority in interest of the Reporting Persons.  For additional information, refer to the Schedule 13Ds filed on July 13, 2006, March 9, 2007, June 26, 2009 and on May 1, 2013 with the SEC. In addition, 1,352,226 shares (approximately 6.9%) of the outstanding common stock of AMERCO are held by our Employee Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Trust.As a result of their stock ownership and the Stockholder Agreement, Edward J. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen and James P. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business affairs and policies of the Company, including the approval of significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that the interests of the Reporting Persons will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of the Reporting Persons’ voting power, the Company is a “controlled company” as defined in the Nasdaq Listing Rules and, therefore, may avail itself of certain exemptions under Nasdaq rules, including exemptions from the rules that require us to have (i) a majority of independent directors on the Board; (ii) independent director oversight of executive officer compensation; and (iii) independent director oversight of director nominations.  Of the above available exemptions, we currently avail ourself of the exemption from independent director oversight of executive officer compensation, other than with respect to the compensation of the President of AMERCO.We bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SAC Holding and Private Mini.At March 31, 2014, we held $137.0 million of notes receivable from SAC Holding and Private Mini Storage Realty, L.P. (“Private Mini”), which consist of junior unsecured notes. These entities are highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holding or Private Mini are unable to meet their obligations to their senior lenders, it could trigger a default of their obligations to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holding and Private Mini is inadequate to repay their senior lenders and our junior unsecured notes. We cannot assure you that SAC Holding or Private Mini will not default on their loans to their senior lenders or that the value of their assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full.

Holmes (Successor Trustee of the Irrevocable “C” Trusts) (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”) are parties to a stockholder agreement dated June 30, 2006 in which the Reporting Persons agreed to vote as one as provided in this agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”).  Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, a collective 10,897,741 shares (approximately 55.6%) of the Company’s common stock are voted at the direction of a majority in interest of the Reporting Persons.  For additional information, refer to the Schedule 13Ds filed on July 13, 2006, March 9, 2007, June 26, 2009 and on May 1, 2013 with the SEC. In addition, 1,450,205 shares (approximately 7.4%) of the outstanding common stock of AMERCO are held by our Employee Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Trust.As a result of their stock ownership and the Stockholder Agreement, Edward J. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen and James P. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business affairs and policies of the Company, including the approval of significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that the interests of the Reporting Persons will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of the Reporting Persons’ voting power, the Company is a “controlled company” as defined in the Nasdaq Listing Rules and, therefore avails itself or may avail itself of certain exemptions under Nasdaq rules, including exemptions from the rules that require us to have (i) a majority of independent directors on the Board; (ii) independent director oversight of executive officer compensation; and (iii) independent director oversight of director nominations.9 We bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SAC Holdings.At March 31, 2013, we held $72.4 million of notes receivable from SAC Holdings, which consist of junior unsecured notes. SAC Holdings is highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holdings is unable to meet its obligations to its senior lenders, it could trigger a default of its obligations to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holdings is inadequate to repay SAC Holdings senior lenders and our junior unsecured notes.  We cannot assure you that SAC Holdings will not default on its loans to its senior lenders or that the value of SAC Holdings assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full. Our quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with our industry.Our business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter is generally weakest, due to a greater potential for adverse weather conditions and other factors that are not necessarily seasonal. As a result, our operating results for any given quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.Our operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations.Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 19, Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these compliance efforts, we believe that the risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state and federal agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their industries.10 Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and changes in laws or other labor issues could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.The success of our business is predicated upon our workforce providing excellent customer service. Our ability to attract and retain this employee base may be inhibited due to prevailing wage rates, benefit costs and the adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Should this occur we may be unable to provide service in certain areas or we may experience significantly increased costs of labor that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business.Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system and telephone systems. While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to serve, it exposes us to various risks including natural and man-made disasters. We have put into place backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate this risk.  However, disruptions or breaches in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business.In May 2013, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford, Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”), North American Insurance Company (“NAI”) of B++. Oxford’s and CFLIC’s outlook remains positive, whereas NAI’s outlook was stable. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ or counterparties’ failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future.We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for our Moving and Storage operating segment. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.At December 31, 2012, Repwest reported $1.7 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $176.4 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, Repwest’s largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $72.1 million"

 The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report or elsewhere.  7   We operate in a highly competitive industry. The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations. The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material affect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use, zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets. We are highly leveraged. As of March 31, 2012, we had total debt outstanding of $1,486.2 million and total undiscounted lease commitments of $325.4 million. Although we believe, based on existing information, that additional leverage can be supported by our operations and revenues, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: ·  require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service payments; ·  limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; ·  limit our ability to obtain additional financing; and ·  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt. Our ability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness. Economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. The United States economy has undergone a period of slowdown and unprecedented volatility, which resulted in a recession.  It is difficult to gauge the pace of the economic recovery or if such recovery may stall or reverse course in the future.  Consumer and commercial spending is generally affected by the health of the economy, which places some of the factors affecting the success of our business beyond our control.  Our industries, although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with or in anticipation of, declines, or sustained lack of recovery, in general economic conditions.  In times of declining consumer spending we may be driven, along with our competitors, to reduce pricing which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  We cannot predict if another downturn, or sustained lack of recovery, in the economy may occur which could result in reduced revenues and working capital.  8   Should credit markets in the United States tighten or if interest rates increase significantly we may not be able to refinance existing debt or find additional financing on favorable terms, if at all.  If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  While we believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirement for working capital, debt servicing and capital expenditures through fiscal 2013, if our operating results were to worsen significantly and our cash flows or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions. To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead us to operate trucks longer than initially planned and/or reducing the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations. Another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides us with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in resale values for our used equipment. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which would result in losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment. We obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers. Over the last ten years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time. We may not be able to effectively hedge against interest rate changes in our variable debt. In certain instances, the Company seeks to manage its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of hedging instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps. We enter into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Additionally, a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to record these financial instruments at their fair value. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact the valuation of the instruments resulting in non-cash changes to our financial position. We are controlled by a small contingent of stockholders. As of March 31, 2012, Edward J. Shoen, President and Chairman of the Board of AMERCO, James P. Shoen, a director of AMERCO, and Mark V. Shoen collectively are the owners of 9,222,365 shares (approximately 47.0%) of the outstanding common stock of AMERCO. In addition, Edward J. Shoen, James P. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen, Rosmarie T. Donovan (Trustee of the Shoen Irrevocable Trusts) and Dunham Trust Company (Successor Trustee of the Irrevocable “C” Trusts) (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”) are parties to a stockholder agreement dated June 30, 2006 in which the Reporting Persons agreed to vote as one as provided in this agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”).  Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, a collective 10,897,088 shares (approximately 55.6%) of the Company’s common stock are voted at the direction of a majority in interest of the Reporting Persons.  For additional information, refer to the Schedule 13Ds filed on July 13, 2006, March 9, 2007 and on June 26, 2009 with the SEC. In addition, 1,482,344 shares (approximately 7.6%) of the outstanding common stock of AMERCO are held by our Employee Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Trust.  9   As a result of their stock ownership and the Stockholder Agreement, Edward J. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen and James P. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence our business affairs and policies of the Company, including the approval of significant transactions, the election of the members of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that the interests of the Reporting Persons will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of the Reporting Persons’ voting power, the Company is a “controlled company” as defined in the Nasdaq Listing Rules and, therefore, may avail itself of certain exemptions under Nasdaq rules, including exemptions from the rules that require us to have (i) a majority of independent directors on the Board; (ii) independent director oversight of executive officer compensation; and (iii) independent director oversight of director nominations.  Of the above available exemptions, we currently avail ourself of the exemption from independent director oversight of executive officer compensation, other than with respect to the compensation of the President of AMERCO. We bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SAC Holdings. At March 31, 2012, we held $195.4 million of notes receivable from SAC Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries (“SAC Holding Corporation”) and SAC Holding II Corporation and its subsidiaries (“SAC Holding II”) (collectively “SAC Holdings”), which consist of junior unsecured notes. SAC Holdings is highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holdings is unable to meet its obligations to its senior lenders, it could trigger a default of its obligations to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holdings is inadequate to repay SAC Holdings senior lenders and our junior unsecured notes.  We cannot assure you that SAC Holdings will not default on its loans to its senior lenders or that the value of SAC Holdings assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full. Due to repayments in April 2012 and May 2012 the total notes receivable balance decreased by $113.5 million, and accrued interest decreased by $5.1 million. Our quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with our industry. Our business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months.

Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter is generally weakest, due to a greater potential for adverse weather conditions and other factors that are not necessarily seasonal. As a result, our operating results for a given quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. Our operations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibility that environmental liability in the future could adversely affect our operations. Compliance with environmental requirements of federal, state and local governments significantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirements regulate the discharge of materials into the air, land and water and govern the use and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common law principles, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found on real property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regarding hazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place a remediation plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary. See Note 19, Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We regularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance with environmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal program since 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these compliance efforts, we believe that risk of environmental liability is part of the nature of our business. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become more stringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with these regulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defending environmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generally resolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We operate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. Our truck and trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department of Transportation and various state and federal agencies exercise broad powers over our motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage, treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business is also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to adhere to these laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipment productivity and increase our costs.  10   In addition, the Federal government may institute some regulation that limits carbon emissions by setting a maximum amount of carbon entities can emit without penalty. This would likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels and would disproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. While there are too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposed federal and state regulations that could affect carbon emissions, many experts believe these proposed rules could significantly affect the way companies operate in their industries. Our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, and changes in laws or other labor issues could adversely affect our business and our results of operations. The success of our business is predicated upon our workforce providing excellent customer service. Our ability to attract and retain this employee base may be inhibited due to prevailing wage rates, benefit costs and the adoption of new or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Should this occur we may be unable to provide service in certain areas or we may experience significantly increased costs of labor that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managing our business. Our information systems are largely Internet-based, including our point-of-sale reservation system and telephone systems. While our reliance on this technology lowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to serve, it exposes the Company to various risks including natural and man-made disasters. We have put into place backup systems and alternative procedures to mitigate this risk.  However, disruptions or breaches in any portion of these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A.M. Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurance business. In April 2011, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford, Christian Fidelity Life Insurance Company, North American Insurance Company and Dallas General Life Insurance Company (“DGLIC”) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain and attract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may incur losses due to our reinsurers’ or counterparties’ failure to perform under existing contracts or we may be unable to secure sufficient reinsurance or hedging protection in the future. We use reinsurance and derivative contracts to mitigate our risk of loss in various circumstances; primarily at Repwest and for our Moving and Storage operating segment. These agreements do not release us from our primary obligations and therefore we remain ultimately responsible for these potential costs. We cannot provide assurance that these reinsurers or counterparties will fulfill their obligations. Their inability or unwillingness to make payments to us under the terms of the contracts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation. At December 31, 2010, Repwest reported $1.0 million of reinsurance recoverables, net of allowances and $167.3 million of reserves and liabilities ceded to reinsurers. Of this, our largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $53.7 million. "
6,UHAL,AMERCO,2010-06-09,"Risk Factors
  The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. We operate in a highly competitive industry.  The truck rental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significant national, regional and local competitors. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental moving equipment, breadth of essential services and products and total cost. Financial results for the Company can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices or implement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we are not able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which would likely have a materially adverse affect on our results of operations. The self-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principal competitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rental locations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas in which we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental rates and operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us to experience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rental rates or require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material affect on results of operations and financial condition. Entry into the self-storage business may be accomplished through the acquisition of existing facilities by persons or institutions with the required initial capital. Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due to land use zoning, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storage industry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceived increases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete in existing markets or expand into new markets.  7   We are highly leveraged.  As of March 31, 2010, we had total debt outstanding of $1,347.6 million and total undiscounted lease commitments of $521.1 million. Although we believe that additional leverage can be supported by the Company’s operations, our existing debt could impact us in the following ways among other considerations: ·  require us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to debt service payments; ·  limit our ability to obtain additional financing; and ·  place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt. Our ability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to maintain and improve our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt that would exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness. Current economic conditions, including those related to the credit markets, may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.  The United States economy has undergone a period of slowdown and unprecedented volatility, which resulted in a recession. The future economic environment may continue to exhibit weakness for an extended period. This slowdown has and could further lead to reduced consumer and commercial spending in the foreseeable future.  Our industries although not as traditionally cyclical as some, could experience significant downturns in connection with, or in anticipation of, declines in general economic conditions.  Declines in consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to reduce pricing further, which would have a negative impact on gross profit.  A continued softening in the economy may adversely and materially affect our industry, business and results of operations and we can not accurately predict how severe and prolonged this downturn might be.  Moreover, reduced revenues as a result of the softening of the economy may also reduce our working capital and interfere with our long term business strategy. The United States credit markets experienced a contraction. As a result of the tightened credit markets, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. If one or more of the financial institutions that support our existing credit facilities fails, we may not be able to find a replacement, which would negatively impact our ability to borrow under credit facilities.  In addition, if the pressures on credit continue or worsen, we may not be able to refinance, if necessary, our outstanding debt when due, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt servicing and capital expenditures through fiscal year 2011, if our operating results worsen significantly and our ;cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face liquidity problems that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our fleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial market conditions.  To meet the needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment. Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operations and externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routine fleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial market conditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could lead to the Company operating trucks longer than initially planned and reducing the size of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect our results of operations. Another important aspect of our fleet rotation program is the sale of used rental equipment. The sale of used equipment provides the organization with funds that can be used to purchase new equipment. Conditions may arise that could lead to the decrease in resale values for our used equipment, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, which would result in increased losses on the sale of equipment and decreases in cash flows from the sales of equipment.  8   We obtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers.  In the last ten years, we purchased the majority of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation. Our fleet rotation can be negatively affected by issues our manufacturers may face within their own supply chain. Also, it is possible that our suppliers may face financial difficulties or organizational changes which could negatively impact their ability to accept future orders or fulfill existing orders. Although we believe that we could contract with alternative manufacturers for our rental trucks, we cannot guarantee or predict how long that would take. In addition, termination of our existing relationship with these suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefinite period of time. We seek to effectively hedge against interest rate changes in our variable debt.  In certain instances, the Company seeks to manage its exposure to interest rate risk through the use of hedging instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward swaps. The Company enters into these arrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutions with whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed to credit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on their obligations. Additionally, a failure on our part to effectively hedge against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are required to record these financial instruments at their fair value. Changes in interest rates can significantly impact the valuation of the instruments resulting in non-cash changes to our financial position. We are controlled by a small contingent of stockholders.  As of March 31, 2010, Edward J. Shoen, Chairman of the Board and President of AMERCO, James P. Shoen, a director of AMERCO, and Mark V. Shoen, an executive officer of AMERCO, collectively are the owners of 9,221,996 shares (approximately 47.0%) of the outstanding common shares of AMERCO. In addition, on June 30, 2006, Edward J. Shoen, James P. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen, Rosmarie T. Donovan (Trustee of the Shoen Irrevocable Trusts) and Southwest Fiduciary, Inc. (Trustee of the Irrevocable “C” Trusts) (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”) entered into a stockholder agreement in which the Reporting Persons agreed to vote as one as provided in this agreement (the “Stockholder Agreement”). As of March 1, 2007, Adagio Trust Company replaced Southwest Fiduciary, Inc. as the trustee of the Irrevocable “C&#8221; Trusts, and became a signatory to the Stockholder Agreement. As of January 1, 2009, Dunham Trust Company replaced Adagio Trust Company as the trustee of the Irrevocable “C” Trusts, and became a signatory to the Stockholder Agreement. Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, the Reporting Persons appointed James P. Shoen as proxy to vote their collective 10,896,719 shares (approximately 55.6%) of the Company’s common stock as provided for in the Stockholder Agreement. For additional information, refer to the Schedule 13D’s filed on July 13, 2006, March 9, 2007 and on June 26, 2009 with the SEC. In addition, 1,686,470 shares (approximately 8.6%) of the outstanding common shares of AMERCO are held by our Employee Savings and Employee Stock Ownership Trust. As a result of their stock ownership and the Stockholder Agreement, Edward J. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen and James P. Shoen are in a position to significantly influence the business affairs and policies of the Company, including the approval of significant transactions, the election of the members of the Board and other matters submitted to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that the interests of the Reporting Persons will not conflict with the interest of our other stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of the Reporting Persons’ voting power, the Company is a “controlled company” as defined in the NASDAQ listing rules and, therefore, may avail itself of certain exemptions under NASDAQ Marketplace Rules, including exemptions from the rules that require the Company to have (i) a majority of independent directors on the Board; (ii) a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our executive officers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (v) director nominees selected, or recommended for the Board’s selection, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. Of the above available exemptions, the Company currently exercises its right to an exemption from the NASDAQ rule requiring compensation of other executive officers, aside from the President, be determined by a majority of the independent directors or the compensation committee.  9   We bear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SAC Holdings.  At March 31, 2010, we held approximately $196.9 million of notes receivable from SAC Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries (“SAC Holding Corporation”) and SAC Holding II (collectively “SAC Holdings”), which consist of junior unsecured notes. SAC Holdings is highly leveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holdings is unable to meet its obligations to its senior lenders, it could trigger a default of its obligations to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to the extent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holdings is inadequate to repay SAC Holding’s senior lenders and our junior unsecured notes.  We cannot assure you that SAC Holdings will not default on its loans to its senior lenders or that the value of SAC Holdings assets upon liquidation would be sufficient to repay us in full. Our quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with our industry.  Our business is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been stronger in the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in moving activity during the spring and summer months.

Of this, our largest exposure to a single reinsurer was $53.8 million. "

Under environmental laws or common lawprinciples, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found onreal property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regardinghazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place aremedial plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary, refer toNote 19 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Weregularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance withenvironmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal programsince 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite these complianceefforts, we believe that risk of environmental liability is part of the natureof our business. Environmentallaws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become morestringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with theseregulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defendingenvironmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generallyresolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results ofoperations. Weoperate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations orviolations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverseeffect on our operations and profitability.  Our truckand trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, stateand foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department ofTransportation and various state and federal agencies exercise broad powers overour motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage,treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business isalso subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating toenvironmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to adhere tothese laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent suchproperty or to use the property as collateral for futureborrowings. Compliance with changing regulations could substantially impairreal property and equipment productivity and increase our costs. TheFederal government likely will institute some sort of carboncap.  This will likely affect everyone who uses fossil fuels anddisproportionately affect users in the highway transportation industries. Thereare too many variables at this time to assess the impact of the various proposedfederal and state regulations. Ourability to attract and retain qualified employees, and changes in laws or otherlabor issues could adversely affect our business and our results ofoperations.  Thesuccess of our business is predicated upon our workforce providing excellentcustomer service. Our ability to attract and retain this employee base may beinhibited due to prevailing wage rates, benefit costs and the adoption of new orrevised employment and labor laws and regulations. Should this occur we may beunable to provide service in certain areas or we may experience significantlyincreased costs of labor that could adversely affect our results of operationsand financial condition. 10   Weare highly dependent upon our automated systems and the Internet for managingour business.  Ourinformation systems are largely internet-based, including our point-of-salereservation system and telephone system. While our reliance on this technologylowers our cost of providing service and expands our abilities to serve, itexposes the Company to various risks including natural disasters and man-madedisasters. We have put into place backup systems and alternative procedures tomitigate this risk.  However, disruptions or breaches in any portionof these systems could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition. A.M.Best financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurancebusiness.  In March2009, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strength rating for Oxford, ChristianFidelity Life Insurance Company (“CFLIC”) and Dallas General Life InsuranceCompany (“DGLIC”) of B++ with a stable outlook. Financial strength ratings areimportant external factors that can affect the success of Oxford’s businessplans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to its competitors, are notmaintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not be able to retain andattract business as currently planned, which could adversely affect our resultsof operations and financial condition. "
14,UHAL,AMERCO,2008-06-04,"    Risk Factors
 Thefollowing discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction withManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations (“MD&A”), the Consolidated Financial Statements and relatednotes.  These risk factors may be important in understanding thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. Weoperate in a highly competitive industry. The truckrental industry is highly competitive and includes a number of significantnational, regional and local competitors. Competition is generally based onconvenience of rental locations, availability of quality rental movingequipment, breadth of essential services and price. Financial results for theCompany can be adversely impacted by aggressive pricing from our competitors.Some of our competitors may have greater financial resources than we have. Wecan not assure you that we will be able to maintain existing rental prices orimplement price increases. Moreover, if our competitors reduce prices and we arenot able or willing to do so as well, we may lose rental volume, which wouldlikely have a materially adverse affect on our results ofoperations. 7   Theself-storage industry is large and highly fragmented. We believe the principlecompetitive factors in this industry are convenience of storage rentallocations, cleanliness, security and price. Competition in the market areas inwhich we operate is significant and affects the occupancy levels, rental salesand operating expenses of our facilities. Competition might cause us toexperience a decrease in occupancy levels, limit our ability to raise rentalsales and require us to offer discounted rates that would have a material affecton operating results. Entryinto the self-storage business through acquisition of existing facilities ispossible for persons or institutions with the required initial capital.Development of new self-storage facilities is more difficult however, due toland use, environmental and other regulatory requirements. The self-storageindustry has in the past experienced overbuilding in response to perceivedincreases in demand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfullycompete in existing markets or expand into new markets. Weare controlled by a small contingent of stockholders. As ofMarch 31, 2008, Edward J. Shoen, Chairman of the Board of Directors andPresident of AMERCO, James P. Shoen, a director of AMERCO, and Mark V. Shoen, anexecutive officer of AMERCO, collectively are the owners of 8,968,079 shares(approximately 45.7%) of the outstanding common shares of AMERCO. In addition,on June 30, 2006, Edward J. Shoen, James P. Shoen, Mark V. Shoen, Rosmarie T.Donovan (Trustee of the Shoen Irrevocable Trusts) and Southwest Fiduciary, Inc.(Trustee of the Irrevocable “C” Trusts) (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”)entered into a Stockholder Agreement in which the Reporting Persons agreed tovote as one as provided in the Stockholder Agreement. As of March 1, 2007,Adagio Trust Company replaced Southwest Fiduciary, Inc. as the trustee of theIrrevocable “C” Trusts, and became a signatory to the Stockholder Agreement.Pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement, the Reporting Persons appointed James P.Shoen as proxy to vote their collective 10,642,802 shares (approximately 54.2%)of the Company’s common stock as provided for in the agreement.  Foradditional information, refer to the Schedule 13D’s filed on July 13, 2006 andon March 9, 2007 with the SEC. In addition, 1,802,702 shares (approximately9.2%) of the outstanding common shares of AMERCO are held by our EmployeeSavings and Employee Stock Ownership Trust. As aresult of their stock ownership and the Stockholder Agreement, Edward J. Shoen,Mark V. Shoen and James P. Shoen are in a position to significantly influencethe business affairs and policies of the Company, including the approval ofsignificant transactions, the election of the members of the Board and othermatters submitted to our stockholders.  There can be no assurance thatthe interests of the Reporting Persons will not conflict with the interest ofour other stockholders.  Furthermore, as a result of the ReportingPersons’ voting power, the Company is a “controlled company” as defined in theNasdaq listing rules and, therefore, may avail itself of certain exemptionsunder Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, including rules that require the Company to have(i) a majority of independent directors on the Board; (ii) a compensationcommittee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) a nominating committeecomposed solely of independent directors; (iv) compensation of our executiveofficers determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensationcommittee composed solely of independent directors; and (v) director nomineesselected, or recommended for the Board’s selection, either by a majority of theindependent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independentdirectors. The Company currently exercises its right to an exemption from theNasdaq rule requiring compensation of other executive officers, aside from thePresident, be determined by a majority of the independent directors or thecompensation committee. Ouroperations subject us to numerous environmental regulations and the possibilitythat environmental liability in the future could adversely affect ouroperations. Compliancewith environmental requirements of federal, state and local governmentssignificantly affects our business. Among other things, these requirementsregulate the discharge of materials into the water, air and land and govern theuse and disposal of hazardous substances. Under environmental laws or common lawprinciples, we can be held liable for hazardous substances that are found onreal property we have owned or operated. We are aware of issues regardinghazardous substances on some of our real estate and we have put in place aremedial plan at each site where we believe such a plan is necessary, refer toNote 17 Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Weregularly make capital and operating expenditures to stay in compliance withenvironmental laws. In particular, we have managed a testing and removal programsince 1988 for our underground storage tanks.  Despite thesecompliance efforts, we believe that risk of environmental liability is part ofthe nature of our business. 8   Environmentallaws and regulations are complex, change frequently and could become morestringent in the future. We cannot assure you that future compliance with theseregulations, future environmental liabilities, the cost of defendingenvironmental claims, conducting any environmental remediation or generallyresolving liabilities caused by us or related third parties will not have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results ofoperations. Ourquarterly results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factorsassociated with our industry. Ourbusiness is seasonal and our results of operations and cash flows fluctuatesignificantly from quarter to quarter. Historically, revenues have been strongerin the first and second fiscal quarters due to the overall increase in movingactivity during the spring and summer months. The fourth fiscal quarter isgenerally weakest, due to a greater potential for adverse weather conditions andother factors that are not necessarily seasonal. As a result, our operatingresults for a given quarterly period are not necessarily indicative of operatingresults for an entire year. Weobtain our rental trucks from a limited number of manufacturers. In thelast ten years, we purchased most of our rental trucks from Ford Motor Companyand General Motors Corporation. Although we believe that we could obtainalternative sources of supply for our rental trucks, termination of one or bothof our relationships with these suppliers could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition or results of operations for an indefiniteperiod of time or we may not be able to obtain rental trucks under similarterms, if at all. Additionally, our fleet rotation can be negatively affected byissues our manufacturers face within their own supply chain. Such issues mayimpair their ability to fulfill our orders in a timely fashion. A.MBest financial strength ratings are crucial to our life insurancebusiness. A.M. Bestdowngraded Oxford and its subsidiaries during AMERCO’s restructuring to C+. UponAMERCO’s emergence from bankruptcy in March 2004, Oxford and its subsidiarieswere upgraded to B-. The ratings were again upgraded in October 2004 to B, inOctober 2005 to B+, and in November 2006 Oxford and Christian Fidelity LifeInsurance Company (“CFLIC”), a subsidiary of Oxford, were upgraded to B++ with astable outlook. In January 2008, A.M. Best affirmed the financial strengthrating for Oxford and CFLIC of B++ with a stable outlook and assigned DallasGeneral Life Insurance Company (“DGLIC”), a subsidiary of CFLIC, with the samerating. Prior to AMERCO’s restructuring, Oxford was rated B++. Financialstrength ratings are important external factors that can affect the success ofOxford’s business plans. Accordingly, if Oxford’s ratings, relative to itscompetitors, are not maintained or do not continue to improve, Oxford may not beable to retain and attract business as currently planned. Webear certain risks related to our notes receivable from SACHoldings. At March31, 2008, we held approximately $198.1 million of notes receivable from SACHoldings, which consist of junior unsecured notes. SAC Holdings is highlyleveraged with significant indebtedness to others. If SAC Holdings is unable tomeet its obligations to its senior lenders, it could trigger a default of itsobligations to us. In such an event of default, we could suffer a loss to theextent the value of the underlying collateral of SAC Holdings is inadequate torepay SAC Holding’s senior lenders and our junior unsecured notes.  Wecannot assure you that SAC Holdings will not default on its loans to its seniorlenders or that the value of SAC Holdings assets upon liquidation would besufficient to repay us in full. Weare highly leveraged. As ofMarch 31, 2008, we had total debt outstanding of $1,504.7 million and totalundiscounted lease commitments of $490.8 million. Although we believe thatadditional leverage can be supported by the Company’s operations, our existingdebt could impact us in the following ways: ·  require      us to allocate a considerable portion of cash flows from operations to      debt service payments; ·  limit      our ability to obtain additional financing;and ·  place      us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less      debt. Ourability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to maintain andimprove our operating performance and generate cash flow. To some extent, thisis subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certainfinancial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Ifwe are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service ourdebt and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capitalexpenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinanceour indebtedness. If we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect ourability to generate revenue. In addition, we may incur additional debt thatwould exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness. 9   We seek to effectively hedge againstinterest rate changes in our variable debt. Incertain instances the Company seeks to manage its exposure to interest rate riskthrough the use of hedging instruments including interest rate swap agreements,interest rate cap agreements and forward swaps. The Company enters into thesearrangements with counterparties that are significant financial institutionswith whom we generally have other financial arrangements. We are exposed tocredit risk should these counterparties not be able to perform on theirobligations. Additionally, a failure on our part to effectively hedge againstinterest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition and resultsof operations. Ourfleet rotation program can be adversely affected by financial marketconditions. To meetthe needs of our customers, U-Haul maintains a large fleet of rental equipment.Our rental truck fleet rotation program is funded internally through operationsand externally from debt and lease financing. Our ability to fund our routinefleet rotation program could be adversely affected if financial marketconditions limit the general availability of external financing. This could leadto the Company operating trucks longer than initially planned and reducing thesize of the fleet, either of which could materially and negatively affect ourresults of operations. Weoperate in a highly regulated industry and changes in existing regulations orviolations of existing or future regulations could have a material adverseeffect on our operations and profitability. Our truckand trailer rental business is subject to regulation by various federal, stateand foreign governmental entities. Specifically, the U.S. Department ofTransportation and various state and federal agencies exercise broad powers overour motor carrier operations, safety, and the generation, handling, storage,treatment and disposal of waste materials. In addition, our storage business isalso subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating toenvironmental protection and human health and safety. The failure to adhere tothese laws and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent suchproperty or to use the property as collateral for future borrowings. Compliancewith changing regulations could substantially impair real property and equipmentproductivity and increase our costs. "
