5,GRC,GORMAN-RUPP CO,2024-02-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Gorman-Rupp’s business and financial performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond its control. In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and access to capital markets. These risks could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from its historical experience and from expected results discussed in forward-looking statements made by the Company related to conditions or events that it anticipates may occur in the future. COMPANY SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS Loss of key personnel  The Company’s success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of its executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel to support the Company’s growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign. Failure to retain key management personnel and attract and retain other highly-skilled personnel could limit the Company’s global growth and ability to execute operational initiatives, or may result in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which could harm the Company’s revenues, operations and product development efforts and could eventually result in a decrease in profitability. 7  Intellectual property security The Company possesses a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and applications for the above, as well as other proprietary information. There is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, the Company’s products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of Company technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to the Company’s, and thus potentially compete with the Company. From time to time, the Company has been faced with instances where competitors have infringed or unfairly used its intellectual property or taken advantage of its design and development efforts. The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Competitors who attempt to copy the Company’s products, technologies or industrial designs are becoming more prevalent, particularly in Asia. If the Company is unable to adequately enforce and protect its intellectual property rights, it could adversely affect its revenues and profits and hamper its ability to grow. Competitors and others may also challenge the validity of the Company’s intellectual property or allege that it has infringed their intellectual property, including through litigation. The Company may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined its products infringe the intellectual property of others. The Company may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license (if available) on terms that are not favorable to it. Regardless of whether infringement claims against the Company are successful, defending against such claims could significantly increase the Company’s costs, divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters, and otherwise adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Growth through Acquisitions  The Company’s historical growth has depended, and its future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on its acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into existing operations. The Company intends to continue to seek additional domestic and international acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen its operations. The Company cannot assure it will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, the Company cannot assure that any acquisition, even if successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Company’s operations and cash flows. The Company has substantial indebtedness, which may impact the Company’s financial condition and the way it operates its business The Company has substantial indebtedness. Such indebtedness includes senior secured first lien credit facilities comprised of a $350 million term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility, and an unsecured senior subordinated term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $90 million. The indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:  ●higher borrowing costs resulting from fluctuations in our variable benchmark borrowing rates that have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our interest rates;  ●reduced availability of cash for the Company’s operations and other business activities after satisfying interest payments and other requirements under the terms of its debt instruments;  ●less flexibility to plan for or react to competitive challenges, and a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that do not have as much indebtedness;  ●difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future;  ●inability to comply with covenants in, and potential for default under, the Company’s debt instruments;  ●inability to operate our business or to take advantage of business opportunities due to restrictions created from the debt covenants; and  ●challenges to repaying or refinancing any of the Company’s debt. The Company’s ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations will depend principally upon its future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, legal and regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, may affect its ability to make payments on its debt and other obligations. 8  Acquisition performance and integration The Company has historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses and may do so in the future in support of its strategy. The success of past and future acquisitions is dependent on the Company’s ability to successfully integrate acquired and existing operations. If the Company is unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, its financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, disputes with sellers, and the inherent risk associated with the Company entering new lines of business. The anticipated benefits from the Fill-Rite transaction may not be realized The Company may not realize the full benefits of the increased sales volume and other benefits that are currently expected to result from the Fill-Rite transaction, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is currently expected. In addition, the benefits of the Fill-Rite transaction may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in material or energy prices, inflationary economic conditions, increased competition, or by other risks and uncertainties. If the Company fails to realize the benefits it anticipates from the Fill-Rite transaction, the Company’s results of operations may be adversely affected. Impairment in the value of intangible assets, including goodwill The Company’s total assets reflect goodwill from acquisitions, representing the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, including other indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment as of October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Finite-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recovered through future net cash flows generated by the assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company’s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of its acquired businesses were to decline, the Company could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of these assets could have an adverse non-cash impact on the Company’s reported results of operations. Defined benefit pension plan settlement expense  The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan (“GR Plan”) covering certain domestic employees and accrues amounts for funding of its obligations under the plan. The GR Plan allows eligible retiring employees to receive a lump-sum distribution for benefits earned in lieu of annual payments and most of the Company’s retirees historically have elected this option. Under applicable accounting rules, if the lump-sum distributions made for a plan year exceed an actuarially-determined threshold of the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, the Company at such point would be required to recognize for that year’s results of operations settlement expense for the resulting unrecognized actuarial loss. The Company has been required to make such adjustments in prior periods, and, if such non-cash adjustments are necessary in future periods, they may negatively impact the Company’s operating results. There was no pension settlement charge recorded in 2023. In 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charges of $6.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, driven by lump-sum distributions discussed above. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. LIFO inventory method  The majority of the Company’s inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and stated at the lower of cost or market. Current cost approximates replacement cost, or market, and LIFO cost is determined at the end of each fiscal year based on inventory levels on-hand at current replacement cost and a LIFO reserve. The Company uses the simplified LIFO method, under which the LIFO reserve is determined utilizing the inflation factor specified in the Producer Price Index for Machinery and Equipment – Pumps, Compressors and Equipment, as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimate of the expected year-end inflation index and, as such, are subject to adjustment each quarter including the fourth quarter when the inflation index for the year is finalized. If inflation causes the Producer Price Index for Machinery and Equipment – Pumps, Compressors and Equipment to increase in future periods, the LIFO reserve will increase with a corresponding increase to non-cash LIFO expense which may negatively impact the Company’s operating results. 9  In 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash LIFO expense of $6.9 million, $18.0 million, and $6.7 million, respectively. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Inventories. As of December 31, 2023 we had a LIFO reserve of $95.1 million, which at the current U.S. Corporate tax rate, represents approximately $20.0 million of income taxes, payment of which is delayed to future dates based upon changes in inventory costs. From time-to-time, discussions regarding changes in U.S. tax laws have included the potential of LIFO being repealed. Should LIFO be repealed, the $20.0 million of postponed taxes, plus any future benefit realized prior to the date of repeal, would likely have to be repaid over some period of time. Repayment of these postponed taxes will reduce the amount of cash that we would have available to fund our operations, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate or other business activities. This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, Family ownership of common equity  A substantial percentage of the Company’s common shares is held by various members of the Gorman family and their respective affiliates. Because of this concentrated ownership relative to many other publicly-traded companies, the market price of the Company’s common shares may be influenced by lower trading volume and therefore more susceptible to price fluctuations than many other companies’ shares. If any one or more of the Company’s significant shareholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of Company common shares at once or within short periods of time, or there was an expectation that such a sale was imminent, then the market price of the Company’s common shares could be negatively affected. GENERAL RISK FACTORS Continuation of current and projected future business environment  The overall pump industry is cyclical in nature, and some of its business activity is related to general business conditions in the durable goods and capital equipment markets. Demand for most of the Company’s products and services is affected by the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by its customers. The level of such investment and expenditures by our customers depends, in turn, on factors such as general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility or sustained increases in prices of commodities such as oil and agricultural products can negatively affect the levels of investment and expenditures of certain customers and result in postponement of capital investment decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. Inflationary economic conditions may further increase prices and exacerbate these risks. Any of these developments may negatively impact the Company’s sales. Highly competitive markets Gorman-Rupp sells its products in highly competitive markets. Maintaining and improving the Company’s competitive position requires periodic investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support, and distribution networks. Even with such investment, the Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company’s competitors may develop products that are superior to its products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services, or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of its products downward to stay competitive. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with its existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to compete successfully could negatively impact the Company’s sales, operating margins and overall financial performance. 10  Availability and costs of raw materials and labor The Company could be adversely affected by raw material price volatility or an inability of its suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements. We are required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of our customers, often with short lead times. Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to source and maintain adequate inventory levels. Raw material and energy expenses are substantial drivers of costs in the manufacture of pumps and changes in these costs are often unpredictable. While the Company manufactures certain parts and components used in its products, the Company’s business requires substantial amounts of raw materials, parts and components to be purchased from suppliers. The availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components purchased from the Company’s suppliers may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions or delays in production or deliveries by suppliers, changes in exchange rates, tariffs, changes in duty rates and changes in other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements. The Company's business depends, in part, upon the adequate recruitment and retention, and continued service of, key managerial, engineering, marketing, sales and technical and operational personnel. Economic conditions may cause an increasingly competitive labor market, which could lead to labor shortages or increased turnover rates within, or increased labor costs to maintain, the Company’s employee base. These considerations may also impact the operations of the Company’s suppliers, who may seek to pass along any increased costs to the Company. Inflationary economic conditions may further increase these various costs. The Company may not be able to pass along any increased material or labor costs to customers for competitive or other reasons. A change in the availability of, or increases in the costs associated with raw materials, parts and components or labor and workforce could affect our ability to fulfill our customer backlog and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity threats  Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of Gorman-Rupp’s systems and networks and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its data. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of its networks and systems, and the deployment of backup and protective systems, the Company’s systems, networks, proprietary information, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to liability for damages or the loss of confidential information including as a result of, but not limited to, the compromising of confidential information relating to customer, supplier, or employee data, improper use of the Company’s systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions which, in turn, could adversely affect Gorman-Rupp’s reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. Compliance with, and costs related to, a variety of import and export laws and regulations  The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding international operations, including regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and various other domestic and foreign governmental agencies. Actual or alleged violations of import-export laws could result in enforcement actions and/or financial penalties. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations and trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted. Future legislation or regulations could limit the countries in which certain of our products may be manufactured or sold or could restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, products from foreign sources. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities  The Company’s operations and properties are subject to numerous domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations which can impose operating and/or financial sanctions for violations. Moreover, environmental and sustainability initiatives, practices, rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non-governmental bodies and may require changes to the Company’s operational practices, standards and expectations and, in turn, increase the Company’s compliance costs. Periodically, the Company has incurred, and it expects to continue to incur, operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements. The Company monitors its environmental responsibilities, together with trends in the related laws, and believes it is in substantial compliance with current regulations. If the Company is required to incur increased compliance costs or violates environmental laws or regulations, future environmental compliance expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 11  Exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, South African Rand and British Pound. Any significant change in the value of these currencies could affect the Company’s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Conditions in foreign countries in which the Company conducts business In 2023, 25% of the Company’s net sales were to customers outside the United States. The Company expects its international and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of its revenue. The Company’s sales from international operations and export sales, and the availability and prices of certain raw materials, parts, and components, are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent to doing business outside the United States. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following, some of which are further addressed in our other Risk Factors
:  ●Possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;  ●Currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;  ●Potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;  ●Disruption of operations from labor or political disturbances, or public health crises;  ●Changes in tariffs, duty rates, and other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements;  ●Increased costs and risks of developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences; and  ●Insurrections, armed conflicts, terrorism or war. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and operations. Changes in our tax rates and exposure to additional income tax liabilities Gorman-Rupp is subject to income and other taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors, including changes in the tax rates as well as rules and regulations in relevant jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities.  If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, the Company’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments. "

BUSINESS  The Gorman-Rupp Company (“Registrant”, “Gorman-Rupp”, the “Company”, “we” or “our”) was incorporated in Ohio in 1934. The Company designs, manufactures and globally sells pumps and pump systems for use in water, wastewater, construction, dewatering, industrial, petroleum, original equipment, agriculture, fire supression, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (“HVAC”), military and other liquid-handling applications. On May 31, 2022, the Company acquired the assets of Fill-Rite and Sotera (“Fill-Rite”), a division of Tuthill Corporation, for $528.0 million. The Company funded the transaction with cash on-hand and new debt. The results of operations for Fill-Rite from the acquisition date are included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. PRODUCTS  The Company operates in one business segment, the manufacture and sale of pumps and pump systems. The following table sets forth, for the years 2020 through 2022, the total net sales, income before income taxes and year-end total assets of the Company.   (Dollars in thousands)   2022  2021  2020 Net sales $521,027  $378,316  $348,967 Income before taxes  13,872   37,248   31,246 Total assets  872,830   420,754   394,457  3  The Company’s product line consists of pump models ranging in size from 1/4” to nearly 15 feet and ranging in rated capacity from less than one gallon per minute to nearly one million gallons per minute. The types of pumps which the Company produces include self-priming centrifugal, standard centrifugal, magnetic drive centrifugal, axial and mixed-flow, vertical turbine line shaft, submersible, high-pressure booster, rotary gear, rotary vein, diaphragm, bellows and oscillating. The pumps have drives that range from 1/35 horsepower electric motors up to much larger electric motors or internal combustion engines capable of producing several thousand horsepower. Many of the larger units comprise encased, fully-integrated water and wastewater pumping stations. In certain cases, units are designed for the inclusion of customer-supplied drives. The Company’s larger pumps are sold principally for use in the construction, industrial, water and wastewater handling fields; for flood control; for boosting low residential water pressure; for pumping refined petroleum products, including the ground refueling of aircraft; for fluid control in HVAC applications; and for various agricultural purposes. The Company’s pumps are also utilized for dewatering purposes. Additionally, pumps manufactured for fire suppression are used for sprinkler back-up systems, fire hydrants, stand pipes, fog systems and deluge systems at hotels, banks, factories, airports, schools, public buildings and hundreds of other types of facilities throughout the world. Many of the Company’s smallest pumps are sold to customers for incorporation into such products as food processing, chemical processing, medical applications, waste treatment, HVAC equipment, appliances and solar heating. MARKETING  The Company’s pumps are marketed in the United States and worldwide through a broad network of distributors, through manufacturers’ representatives (for sales to many original equipment manufacturers), through third-party distributor catalogs, direct sales, and commerce. The Company regularly seeks alliances with distributors and other partners to further enhance marketing opportunities. Export sales are made primarily through foreign distributors and representatives. The Company has long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets it serves and provides specialized training programs to distributors on a regular basis with a focus on meeting the world’s water and wastewater pumping needs. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no shipments to any single customer that exceeded 10% of total net sales. Gorman-Rupp continued to actively pursue international business opportunities and, in 2022, shipped its pumps to approximately 130 countries around the world. No sales made to customers in any one foreign country amounted to more than 10% of total net sales for 2022, 2021 or 2020. COMPETITION  The pump industry is highly fragmented and therefore Gorman-Rupp competes with a large number of businesses. Numerous pump competitors exist as subsidiaries, divisions or departments within significantly larger corporations. The Company also faces increased competition from foreign-sourced pumps in most of the Company’s domestic markets. Most commercial and industrial pumps are specifically designed and engineered for a particular customer’s application. The Company believes that proper application, product performance, and quality of delivery and service are its principal methods of competition, and attributes its success to its continued emphasis in these areas. In the sale of products and services, the Company benefits from its large base of previously installed products, which periodically require replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate. 4  PURCHASING AND PRODUCTION  Substantially all of the materials, supplies, components and accessories used by the Company in the fabrication of its products, including all castings (for which most patterns are made and owned by the Company), structural steel, bar stock, motors, solenoids, engines, seals, and plastic and elastomeric components are purchased by the Company from other suppliers and manufacturers. The Company does not purchase materials under long-term contracts and is not dependent upon a single source for any materials, supplies, components or accessories which are of material importance to its business. The Company purchases motor components for its large submersible pumps, and motors and engines for its pump systems, from a limited number of suppliers, while motors for its polypropylene bellows pumps and magnetic drive pumps are purchased from several alternative vendors. Products requiring small motors are also sourced from alternative suppliers. The other production operations of the Company consist of the machining of castings, the cutting, shaping and welding of bar stock and structural members, the design and assembly of electrical control panels, the manufacture of some small motors and a few minor components, and the assembling, painting and testing of its products. Substantially all of the Company’s products are tested prior to shipment. HUMAN CAPITAL  As of December 31, 2022, the Company employed approximately 1,420 persons, of whom approximately 800 were hourly employees. The majority of the Company’s manufacturing operations take place in the United States, as evidenced by 88% of its employees being in the Company’s U.S. locations and 12% of its employees being in its international locations.  Our approach is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. We invest resources to develop the talent needed to remain a leading designer and manufacturer of pumps and pump systems. We provide our employees with training opportunities and educational benefits to assist in the expansion of their careers and skills. This approach has resulted in a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products, and customers.  We believe that our average tenure of 10 years, as of the end of 2022, reflects both the strong engagement of our employees and our positive workplace culture.  Approximately 8% of our employees operate under a collective bargaining agreement. The Company has never experienced a work stoppage. We provide competitive compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees.  In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country and region) include profit sharing, a 401(k) plan, medical insurance and benefits, health savings accounts, paid time off, and tuition assistance, among others.  Certain domestic employees hired prior to January 1, 2008, and certain union employees, participate in defined benefit plans.  Non-union employees hired after this date, in eligible locations, participate in an enhanced 401(k) plan instead of the defined benefit plan.  To create performance incentives and to encourage share ownership by our employees, we have implemented an employee stock purchase plan, which enables eligible employees worldwide to purchase the Company’s common shares at a discount through payroll contributions. Because our business involves the manufacturing of products, many of our employees are unable to work from home. For certain positions, we do provide hybrid work from home options. The health and safety of our workforce is fundamental to the success of our business.  We provide our employees upfront and ongoing safety training to ensure that safety policies and procedures are effectively communicated and implemented. We also provide personal protective equipment to those employees who need it to perform their job functions safely.  We have experienced personnel on-site at each of our manufacturing locations who are tasked with environmental, health and personal safety education and compliance, and in certain locations we have an on-site nurse available to our employees for medical needs. We are committed to upholding fundamental human rights and believe that all human beings should be treated with dignity, fairness and respect.  This commitment is outlined in our Human Rights Policy which applies to all employees worldwide including part time and temporary workers. We communicated our expectation that suppliers also adhere to our Human Rights Policy through our Supplier Code of Conduct. We strive to promote inclusion and diversity in the workplace, engage with our communities, and encourage our suppliers to treat their employees in a manner that respects human rights.  We utilize an on-line platform to provide training to all employees worldwide in key areas such as harassment and discrimination prevention, human rights, and our code of conduct.  We also internally publicize the availability of an anonymous ethics hotline through which any employee may report any ethics, safety or other employment concerns. 5  OTHER ASPECTS  Although the Company owns a number of patents, several of which are important to its business, the Company does not consider its business to be materially dependent upon any one or more patents. The Company’s patents, trademarks and other intellectual property are adequate for its business purposes. AVAILABLE INFORMATION  The Company maintains a website accessible through its internet address of www.gormanrupp.com. Gorman-Rupp makes available free of charge on or through www.gormanrupp.com its Annual Report to Shareholders, its annual Proxy Statement, its annual report on Form 10-K, its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and its current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports (and any amendments) are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”). However, the information contained on the Company’s website is not a part of this Form 10-K or any other report filed with or furnished to the Commission. A paper copy of the Company’s Form 10-K is also available free of charge upon written request to the Company’s Corporate Secretary. ITEM  1A. RISK FACTORS Gorman-Rupp’s business and financial performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond its control. In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and access to capital markets. These risks could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from its historical experience and from expected results discussed in forward-looking statements made by the Company related to conditions or events that it anticipates may occur in the future. COMPANY SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS Loss of key personnel  The Company’s success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of its executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel to support the Company’s growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign. Failure to retain key management personnel and attract and retain other highly-skilled personnel could limit the Company’s global growth and ability to execute operational initiatives, or may result in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which could harm the Company’s revenues, operations and product development efforts and could eventually result in a decrease in profitability. Intellectual property security The Company possesses a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and applications for the above, as well as other proprietary information. There is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, the Company’s products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of Company technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to the Company’s, and thus potentially compete with the Company. From time to time, the Company has been faced with instances where competitors have infringed or unfairly used its intellectual property or taken advantage of its design and development efforts. The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Competitors who attempt to copy the Company’s products, technologies or industrial designs are becoming more prevalent, particularly in Asia. If the Company is unable to adequately enforce and protect its intellectual property rights, it could adversely affect its revenues and profits and hamper its ability to grow. 6  Competitors and others may also challenge the validity of the Company’s intellectual property or allege that it has infringed their intellectual property, including through litigation. The Company may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined its products infringe the intellectual property of others. The Company may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license (if available) on terms that are not favorable to it. Regardless of whether infringement claims against the Company are successful, defending against such claims could significantly increase the Company’s costs, divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters, and otherwise adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Acquisition performance and integration The Company’s historical growth has depended, and its future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on its acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into existing operations. The Company intends to continue to seek additional domestic and international acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen its operations. The Company cannot assure it will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, the Company cannot assure that any acquisition, even if successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Company’s operations and cash flows. The Company incurred substantial indebtedness, which may impact the Company’s financial condition and the way it operates its business In connection with the Company’s acquisition of the assets of Fill-Rite, the Company incurred substantial indebtedness. Such indebtedness includes senior secured first lien credit facilities comprised of a $350 million term loan facility and a $100 million revolving credit facility, and an unsecured senior subordinated term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $90 million. The indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:  ●higher borrowing costs resulting from fluctuations in our variable benchmark borrowing rates that have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our interest rates;  ●reduced availability of cash for the Company’s operations and other business activities after satisfying interest payments and other requirements under the terms of its debt instruments;  ●less flexibility to plan for or react to competitive challenges, and a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that do not have as much indebtedness;  ●difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future;  ●inability to comply with covenants in, and potential for default under, the Company’s debt instruments;  ●inability to operate our business or to take advantage of business opportunities due to restrictions created from the debt covenants; and  ●challenges to repaying or refinancing any of the Company’s debt. The Company’s ability to satisfy its debt and other obligations will depend principally upon its future operating performance. As a result, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, legal and regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond the Company’s control, may affect its ability to make payments on its debt and other obligations. The Company’s operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions The Company has historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses, such as Fill-Rite, and may do so in the future in support of its strategy. The success of past and future acquisitions is dependent on the Company’s ability to successfully integrate acquired and existing operations. If the Company is unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, its financial results could suffer. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions are the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, additional debt leverage, the loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities, disputes with sellers, and the inherent risk associated with the Company entering new lines of business. 7  The anticipated benefits from the Fill-Rite transaction may not be realized The Company may not realize the full benefits of the increased sales volume and other benefits that are currently expected to result from the Fill-Rite transaction, or realize these benefits within the time frame that is currently expected. In addition, the benefits of the Fill-Rite transaction may be offset by operating losses relating to changes in material or energy prices, inflationary economic conditions, increased competition, or by other risks and uncertainties. If the Company fails to realize the benefits it anticipates from the Fill-Rite transaction, the Company’s results of operations may be adversely affected. Impairment in the value of intangible assets, including goodwill The Company’s total assets reflect goodwill from acquisitions, representing the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, including other indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment as of October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Finite-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recovered through future net cash flows generated by the assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company’s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of its acquired businesses were to decline, the Company could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of these assets could have an adverse non-cash impact on the Company’s reported results of operations. Defined benefit pension plan settlement expense  The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan (“GR Plan”) covering certain domestic employees and accrues amounts for funding of its obligations under the plan. The GR Plan allows eligible retiring employees to receive a lump-sum distribution for benefits earned in lieu of annual payments and most of the Company’s retirees historically have elected this option. Under applicable accounting rules, if the lump-sum distributions made for a plan year exceed an actuarially-determined threshold of the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, the Company at such point would be required to recognize for that year’s results of operations settlement expense for the resulting unrecognized actuarial loss. The Company has been required to make such adjustments, and, if such non-cash adjustments are necessary in future periods, they may negatively impact the Company’s operating results. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charges of $6.4 million, $2.3 million, and $4.6 million, respectively, driven by lump-sum distributions discussed above. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. LIFO inventory method  The majority of the Company’s inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method and stated at the lower of cost or market. Current cost approximates replacement cost, or market, and LIFO cost is determined at the end of each fiscal year based on inventory levels on-hand at current replacement cost and a LIFO reserve. The Company uses the simplified LIFO method, under which the LIFO reserve is determined utilizing the inflation factor specified in the Producer Price Index for Machinery and Equipment – Pumps, Compressors and Equipment, as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s estimate of the expected year-end inflation index and, as such, are subject to adjustment each quarter including the fourth quarter when the inflation index for the year is finalized. If inflation causes the Producer Price Index for Machinery and Equipment – Pumps, Compressors and Equipment to increase in future periods, the LIFO reserve will increase with a corresponding increase to non-cash LIFO expense which may negatively impact the Company’s operating results. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash LIFO expense of $18.0 million, $6.7 million, and $1.0 million, respectively. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Inventories. 8  As of December 31, 2022 we had a LIFO reserve of $88.2 million, which at the current U.S. Corporate tax rate, represents approximately $18.5 million of income taxes, payment of which is delayed to future dates based upon changes in inventory costs. From time-to-time, discussions regarding changes in U.S. tax laws have included the potential of LIFO being repealed. Should LIFO be repealed, the $18.5 million of postponed taxes, plus any future benefit realized prior to the date of repeal, would likely have to be repaid over some period of time. Repayment of these postponed taxes will reduce the amount of cash that we would have available to fund our operations, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate or other business activities. This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, Family ownership of common equity  A substantial percentage of the Company’s common shares is held by various members of the Gorman family and their respective affiliates. Because of this concentrated ownership relative to many other publicly-traded companies, the market price of the Company’s common shares may be influenced by lower trading volume and therefore more susceptible to price fluctuations than many other companies’ shares. If any one or more of the Company’s significant shareholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of Company common shares at once or within short periods of time, or there was an expectation that such a sale was imminent, then the market price of the Company’s common shares could be negatively affected. GENERAL RISK FACTORS Continuation of current and projected future business environment  The overall pump industry is cyclical in nature, and some of its business activity is related to general business conditions in the durable goods and capital equipment markets. Demand for most of the Company’s products and services is affected by the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by its customers. The level of such investment and expenditures by our customers depends, in turn, on factors such as general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility or sustained increases in prices of commodities such as oil and agricultural products can negatively affect the levels of investment and expenditures of certain customers and result in postponement of capital investment decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. Inflationary economic conditions may further increase prices and exacerbate these risks. Any of these developments may negatively impact the Company’s sales. Highly competitive markets Gorman-Rupp sells its products in highly competitive markets. Maintaining and improving the Company’s competitive position requires periodic investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support, and distribution networks. Even with such investment, the Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company’s competitors may develop products that are superior to its products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services, or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of its products downward to stay competitive. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with its existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to compete successfully could negatively impact the Company’s sales, operating margins and overall financial performance. Availability and costs of raw materials and labor The Company could be adversely affected by raw material price volatility or an inability of its suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements. We are required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of our customers, often with short lead times. Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to source and maintain adequate inventory levels. Raw material and energy expenses are substantial drivers of costs in the manufacture of pumps and changes in these costs are often unpredictable. While the Company manufactures certain parts and components used in its products, the Company’s business requires substantial amounts of raw materials, parts and components to be purchased from suppliers. The availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components purchased from the Company’s suppliers may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production or deliveries by suppliers, changes in exchange rates, tariffs, changes in duty rates and changes in other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements. 9  The Company's business depends, in part, upon the adequate recruitment and retention, and continued service of, key managerial, engineering, marketing, sales and technical and operational personnel. Economic conditions may cause an increasingly competitive labor market, which could lead to labor shortages or increased turnover rates within, or increased labor costs to maintain, the Company’s employee base. These considerations may also impact the operations of the Company’s suppliers, who may seek to pass along any increased costs to the Company. Inflationary economic conditions may further increase these various costs. The Company may not be able to pass along any increased material or labor costs to customers for competitive or other reasons. A change in the availability of, or increases in the costs associated with raw materials, parts and components or labor and workforce could affect our ability to fulfill our customer backlog and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Cyber security threats  Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of Gorman-Rupp’s systems and networks and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its data. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of its networks and systems, and the deployment of backup and protective systems, the Company’s systems, networks, proprietary information, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to liability for damages or the loss of confidential information including as a result of, but not limited to, the compromising of confidential information relating to customer, supplier, or employee data, improper use of the Company’s systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions which, in turn, could adversely affect Gorman-Rupp’s reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. Compliance with, and costs related to, a variety of import and export laws and regulations  The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding international operations, including regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and various other domestic and foreign governmental agencies. Actual or alleged violations of import-export laws could result in enforcement actions and/or financial penalties. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations and trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted. Future legislation or regulations could limit the countries in which certain of our products may be manufactured or sold or could restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, products from foreign sources. Environmental compliance costs and liabilities  The Company’s operations and properties are subject to numerous domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations which can impose operating and/or financial sanctions for violations. Moreover, environmental and sustainability initiatives, practices, rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non-governmental bodies and may require changes to the Company’s operational practices, standards and expectations and, in turn, increase the Company’s compliance costs. Periodically, the Company has incurred, and it expects to continue to incur, operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements. The Company monitors its environmental responsibilities, together with trends in the related laws, and believes it is in substantial compliance with current regulations. If the Company is required to incur increased compliance costs or violates environmental laws or regulations, future environmental compliance expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, South African Rand and British Pound. Any significant change in the value of these currencies could affect the Company’s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 10  Conditions in foreign countries in which the Company conducts business In 2022, 27% of the Company’s net sales were to customers outside the United States. The Company expects its international and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of its revenue. The Company’s sales from international operations and export sales are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent to doing business outside the United States. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following, some of which are further addressed in our other Risk Factors
:  ●Possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;  ●Currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;  ●Potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;  ●Disruption of operations from labor or political disturbances, or public health crises;  ●Changes in tariffs, duty rates, and other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements;  ●Increased costs and risks of developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences; and  ●Insurrections, armed conflicts, terrorism or war. Any of these events could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and operations. Changes in our tax rates and exposure to additional income tax liabilities Gorman-Rupp is subject to income and other taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors, including changes in the tax rates as well as rules and regulations in relevant jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities.  If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, the Company’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments. "
8,GRC,GORMAN-RUPP CO,2022-02-28,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS Gorman-Rupp’s business and financial performance are subject to various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond its control. In addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and access to capital markets. These risks could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from its historical experience and from expected results discussed in forward-looking statements made by the Company related to conditions or events that it anticipates may occur in the future. COMPANY SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS Loss of key personnel  The Company’s success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of its executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel to support the Company’s growth and operational initiatives and replace executives who retire or resign. Failure to retain key management personnel and attract and retain other highly-skilled personnel could limit the Company’s global growth and ability to execute operational initiatives, or may result in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which could harm the Company’s revenues, operations and product development efforts and could eventually result in a decrease in profitability. Intellectual property security The Company possesses a wide array of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and applications for the above, as well as other proprietary information. There is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, the Company’s products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of Company technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to the Company’s, and thus potentially compete with the Company. From time to time, the Company has been faced with instances where competitors have infringed or unfairly used its intellectual property or taken advantage of its design and development efforts. The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Competitors who may attempt to copy the Company’s products, technologies or industrial designs are becoming more prevalent, particularly in Asia. If the Company is unable to adequately enforce and protect its intellectual property rights, it could adversely affect its revenues and profits and hamper its ability to grow.       6                  Competitors and others may also challenge the validity of the Company’s intellectual property or allege that it has infringed their intellectual property, including through litigation. The Company may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined its products infringe the intellectual property of others. The Company may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license (if available) on terms that are not favorable to it. Regardless of whether infringement claims against the Company are successful, defending against such claims could significantly increase the Company’s costs, divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters, and otherwise adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Acquisition performance and integration The Company’s historical growth has depended, and its future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on its acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into existing operations. The Company intends to continue to seek additional domestic and international acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen its operations. The Company cannot assure it will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, the Company cannot assure that any acquisition, even if successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Company’s operations and cash flows. Impairment in the value of intangible assets, including goodwill The Company’s total assets reflect goodwill from acquisitions, representing the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, including other indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment as of October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Finite-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recovered through future net cash flows generated by the assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company’s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of its acquired businesses were to decline, the Company could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of these assets could have an adverse non-cash impact on the Company’s reported results of operations. Defined benefit pension plan settlement expense  The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering certain domestic employees and accrues amounts for funding of its obligations under the plan. The defined benefit pension plan allows eligible retiring employees to receive a lump-sum distribution for benefits earned in lieu of annual payments and most of the Company’s retirees historically have elected this option.

The Company has been required to make such adjustments in some prior years, and, if such non-cash adjustments are necessary in future periods, they may negatively impact the Company’s operating results. In 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charges of $2.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, driven by lump-sum distributions discussed above. There was no pension settlement charge recorded in 2019. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Family ownership of common equity  A substantial percentage of the Company’s common shares is held by various members of the Gorman family and their respective affiliates. Because of this concentrated ownership relative to many other publicly-traded companies, the market price of the Company’s common shares may be influenced by lower trading volume and therefore more susceptible to price fluctuations than many other companies’ shares. If any one or more of the Company’s significant shareholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of Company common shares at once or within short periods of time, or there was an expectation that such a sale was imminent, then the market price of the Company’s common shares could be negatively affected.       7                  GENERAL RISK FACTORS The COVID-19 Pandemic Our business has been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the present coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic has disrupted our operations and may continue to affect our business, including through government imposed mandatory closures, work-from-home orders, social distancing protocols, increased employee absenteeism due to illness and/or quarantine requirements, voluntary facility closures and other government restrictions that, to the extent required, could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations. While we have largely avoided facility closures and production disruptions thus far, we may experience temporary facility closures in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate or in response to positive diagnoses for COVID-19 in certain facilities for the safety of our employees. Our supply chain has thus far remained largely intact, however, if the COVID-19 pandemic persists or worsens, it may increase disruption to our supply chain and the operations of our suppliers and materially adversely impact the availability and cost of supplies for our facilities and production, and to provide personal protective equipment for our employees, which could materially adversely affect our operations. There may also be long-term negative economic effects on our customers in, and the economies of, affected countries. Any of the foregoing within the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate may severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, future changes in the Company’s cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors as a result of the above may cause the Company’s goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down goodwill for the amount of the impairment. The negative financial impact to our future results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material. Our internal controls may also be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A large portion of our financial and accounting personnel have been required to work from home for extended periods due to the pandemic, requiring them to adapt to new or modified processes, procedures, and controls. These changes could potentially negatively impact our internal controls over financial reporting. Continuation of current and projected future business environment  The overall pump industry is cyclical in nature, and some of its business activity is related to general business conditions in the durable goods and capital equipment markets. Demand for most of the Company’s products and services is affected by the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by its customers. The level of such investment and expenditures by our customers depends, in turn, on factors such as general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility or sustained increases in prices of commodities such as oil and agricultural products can negatively affect the levels of investment and expenditures of certain customers and result in postponement of capital investment decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. Inflationary economic conditions may further increase prices and exacerbate these risks. Any of these developments may negatively impact the Company’s sales. Highly competitive markets Gorman-Rupp sells its products in highly competitive markets. Maintaining and improving the Company’s competitive position requires periodic investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support, and distribution networks. Even with such investment, the Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company’s competitors may develop products that are superior to its products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services, or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of its products downward to stay competitive. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with its existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to compete successfully could negatively impact the Company’s sales, operating margins and overall financial performance.       8                  Availability and costs of raw materials and labor The Company could be adversely affected by raw material price volatility or an inability of its suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements.

Any significant change in the value of these currencies could affect the Company’s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Conditions in foreign countries in which the Company conducts business In 2021, 31% of the Company’s net sales were to customers outside the United States. The Company expects its international and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of its revenue and it has placed a particular emphasis on increasing its growth and presence internationally. The Company’s sales from international operations and export sales are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent to doing business outside the United States. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following, some of which are further addressed in our other Risk Factors
:   ●  Possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;   ●  Currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;   ●  Potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;   ●  Disruption of operations from labor or political disturbances, or public health crises;   ●  Changes in tariffs, duty rates, and other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements;   ●  Increased costs and risks of developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences; and   ●  Insurrections, armed conflicts, terrorism or war.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and operations. Changes in our tax rates and exposure to additional income tax liabilities Gorman-Rupp is subject to income and other taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors, including changes in the tax rates as well as rules and regulations in relevant jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities.  If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, the Company’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments. "

There is a risk that third parties would attempt to copy, in full or in part, the Company’s products, technologies or industrial designs, or to obtain unauthorized access and use of Company technological know-how or other protected intellectual property rights. Also, other companies could successfully develop technologies, products or industrial designs similar to the Company’s, and thus potentially compete with the Company. From time to time, the Company has been faced with instances where competitors have infringed or unfairly used its intellectual property or taken advantage of its design and development efforts. The ability to protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions. Competitors who may attempt to copy the Company’s products, technologies or industrial designs are becoming more prevalent, particularly in Asia. If the Company is unable to adequately enforce and protect its intellectual property rights, it could adversely affect its revenues and profits and hamper its ability to grow.        6                   Competitors and others may also challenge the validity of the Company’s intellectual property or allege that it has infringed their intellectual property, including through litigation. The Company may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined its products infringe the intellectual property of others. The Company may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license (if available) on terms that are not favorable to it. Regardless of whether infringement claims against the Company are successful, defending against such claims could significantly increase the Company’s costs, divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters, and otherwise adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Acquisition performance and integration The Company’s historical growth has depended, and its future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on its acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into existing operations. The Company intends to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen its operations. The Company cannot assure it will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, the Company cannot assure that any acquisition, even if successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Company’s operations and cash flows.     Impairment in the value of intangible assets, including goodwill The Company’s total assets reflect goodwill from acquisitions, representing the excess cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, including other indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment as of October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a possible permanent loss of value using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis. Finite-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recovered through future net cash flows generated by the assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company’s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecast levels or if market conditions for one or more of its acquired businesses were to decline, the Company could be required to incur a non-cash charge to operating income for impairment. Any impairment in the value of these assets could have an adverse non-cash impact on the Company’s reported results of operations. Defined benefit pension plan settlement expense  The Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering certain domestic employees and accrues amounts for funding of its obligations under the plan. The defined benefit pension plan allows eligible retiring employees to receive a lump-sum distribution for benefits earned in lieu of annual payments and most of the Company’s retirees historically have elected this option. Under applicable accounting rules, if the lump-sum distributions made for a plan year exceed an actuarially-determined threshold of the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, the Company at such point would be required to recognize for that year’s results of operations settlement expense for the resulting unrecognized actuarial loss. The Company has been required to make such adjustments in some prior years, and, if such non-cash adjustments are necessary in future periods, they may negatively impact the Company’s operating results.        7                   In 2020 and 2018, the Company recorded pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charges of $4.6 million and $2.9 million respectively, driven by lump-sum distributions discussed above. There was no pension settlement charge recorded in 2019. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Family ownership of common equity  A substantial percentage of the Company’s common shares is held by various members of the Gorman family and their respective affiliates. Because of this concentrated ownership relative to many other publicly-traded companies, the market price of the Company’s common shares may be influenced by lower trading volume and therefore more susceptible to price fluctuations than many other companies’ shares. If any one or more of the Company’s significant shareholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of Company common shares at once or within short periods of time, or there was an expectation that such a sale was imminent, then the market price of the Company’s common shares could be negatively affected. GENERAL RISK FACTORS The COVID-19 Pandemic Our business has been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by the present coronavirus (or COVID-19) pandemic. The pandemic has disrupted our operations and may continue to affect our business, including through government imposed mandatory closures, work-from-home orders, social distancing protocols, voluntary facility closures and other government restrictions that, to the extent required, could materially adversely affect our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations. While we have largely avoided facility closures and production disruptions thus far, we may experience temporary facility closures in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate or in response to positive diagnoses for COVID-19 in certain facilities for the safety of our employees.  Our supply chain has thus far remained largely intact, however, if the COVID-19 pandemic persists or worsens, it may increase disruption to our supply chain and materially adversely impact our ability to secure supplies for our facilities and production, and to provide personal protective equipment for our employees, which could materially adversely affect our operations. There may also be long-term negative economic effects on our customers in, and the economies of, affected countries. Any of the foregoing within the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate may severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, future changes in the Company’s cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors as a result of the above may cause the Company’s goodwill to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down goodwill for the amount of the impairment. The negative financial impact to our future results cannot be reasonably estimated, but could be material. Our internal controls may also be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. A large portion of our financial and accounting personnel have been required to work from home for extended periods due to the pandemic, requiring them to adapt to new or modified processes, procedures, and controls. These changes could potentially negatively impact our internal controls over financial reporting. Continuation of current and projected future business environment  The overall pump industry is cyclical in nature, and some of its business activity is related to general business conditions in the durable goods and capital equipment markets. Demand for most of the Company’s products and services is affected by the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by its customers. The level of such investment and expenditures by our customers depends, in turn, on factors such as general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility in prices of commodities such as oil and agricultural products can negatively affect the levels of investment and expenditures of certain customers and result in postponement of capital investment decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders, either of which may negatively impact the Company’s sales.        8                   Highly competitive markets Gorman-Rupp sells its products in highly competitive markets. Maintaining and improving the Company’s competitive position requires periodic investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support, and distribution networks. Even with such investment, the Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company’s competitors may develop products that are superior to its products, or may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services, or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of its products downward to stay competitive. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with its existing competitors or with new competitors. Failure to compete successfully could negatively impact the Company’s sales, operating margins and overall financial performance. Availability and costs of raw materials  The Company could be adversely affected by raw material price volatility or an inability of its suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements. We are required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of our customers, often with short lead times. Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to source and maintain adequate inventory levels. Raw material and energy expenses are substantial drivers of costs in the manufacture of pumps and changes in these costs are often unpredictable. While the Company manufactures certain parts and components used in its products, the Company’s business requires substantial amounts of raw materials, parts and components to be purchased from suppliers. The availability and prices of raw materials, parts and components purchased from the Company’s suppliers may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production or deliveries by suppliers, changes in exchange rates, tariffs, changes in duty rates and changes in other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements. The Company may not be able to pass along any increased material costs to customers for competitive or other reasons. A change in the availability of, or increases in the price for, these raw materials, parts and components could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Cyber security threats  Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of Gorman-Rupp’s systems and networks and to the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of its data. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of its networks and systems, and the deployment of backup and protective systems, the Company’s systems, networks, proprietary information, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to liability for damages or the loss of confidential information including as a result of, but not limited to, the compromising of confidential information relating to customer, supplier, or employee data, improper use of the Company’s systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions which, in turn, could adversely affect Gorman-Rupp’s reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. Compliance with, and costs related to, a variety of import and export laws and regulations  The Company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding international operations, including regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security and various other domestic and foreign governmental agencies. Actual or alleged violations of import-export laws could result in enforcement actions and/or financial penalties. The Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations and trading practices might be subject or the manner in which existing laws or regulations might be administered or interpreted. Future legislation or regulations could limit the countries in which certain of our products may be manufactured or sold or could restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, products from foreign sources.        9                   Environmental compliance costs and liabilities  The Company’s operations and properties are subject to numerous domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations which can impose operating and/or financial sanctions for violations. Moreover, environmental and sustainability initiatives, practices, rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non-governmental bodies and may require changes to the Company’s operational practices, standards and expectations and, in turn, increase the Company’s compliance costs. Periodically, the Company has incurred, and it expects to continue to incur, operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements. The Company monitors its environmental responsibilities, together with trends in the related laws, and believes it is in substantial compliance with current regulations. If the Company is required to incur increased compliance costs or violates environmental laws or regulations, future environmental compliance expenditures or liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, South African Rand and British Pound. Any significant change in the value of these currencies could affect the Company’s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Conditions in foreign countries in which the Company conducts business In 2020, 29% of the Company’s net sales were to customers outside the United States. The Company expects its international and export sales to continue to be a significant portion of its revenue and it has placed a particular emphasis on increasing its growth and presence internationally. The Company’s sales from international operations and export sales are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent to doing business outside the United States. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following, some of which are further addressed in our other Risk Factors
:   ●  Possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;   ●  Currency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;   ●  Potential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;   ●  Disruption of operations from labor or political disturbances, or public health crises;   ●  Changes in tariffs, duty rates, and other trade barriers and import and export licensing requirements;   ●  Increased costs and risks of developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a number of global operations as a result of distance as well as language and cultural differences; and   ●  Insurrections, armed conflicts, terrorism or war.  Any of these events could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and operations. Changes in our tax rates and exposure to additional income tax liabilities Gorman-Rupp is subject to income and other taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company’s future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors, including changes in the tax rates as well as rules and regulations in relevant jurisdictions. In addition, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities.  If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, the Company’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments. "
