  Lead time and the cost of our products could increase if we were to lose one of our primary suppliers.  Historically, we have been dependent on NSC for our supply of coil inventory and on USS for our supply of coil material used in pipe manufacturing. While current levels are adequate to sustain our coil operations,a reduction in the supply of steel coils could have an adverse effect on our coil operations. Historically, USS has been our primary supplier of tubular products. The Company can make no assurances as to the amounts of pipe and coil material thatwill be available from USS in the future.  If, for any reason, NSC should curtail or discontinue deliveries of coil inventory to us inquantities we need and at prices that are competitive, our business could be negatively impacted. Also, if a reduction in the supply by USS of material used in the manufacture of tubular products should continue for a prolonged period or USS shoulddiscontinue such deliveries completely, the negative impact on our business could be significant. If, in the future, we are unable for a prolonged period to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timelybasis from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or resultsof operations.  Our future operating results may be affected if we were to lose one of our significant customers. In fiscal 2012 and 2011, sales of pipe to USS accounted for approximately 24% and 20%, respectively, of the Companys total sales. A prolongedreduction in sales to USS or the permanent loss of USS as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business. Our future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in raw material prices. We may not be able to pass on increases in raw materialcosts to our customers.  Our principal raw materials are tubular products and steel coils, which we purchase from a limited number ofprimary steel producers. The steel industry as a whole is very cyclical, and at times pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor costs, competition, import duties, tariffs andcurrency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect our steel costs. We are required to maintain substantial inventories to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, wepurchase raw materials on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices and market conditions. In an environmentof increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will impact how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our customers, theprofitability of our business could be adversely affected.   4 Our business is highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our gross profit and netincome.  The principal markets that we serve are highly competitive. Competition is based primarily on the precision and range ofachievable tolerances, quality, price, raw materials and inventory availability and the ability to meet delivery schedules dictated by customers. Our competition in the markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes, some ofwhich have greater financial and other resources than we do and some of which have more established brand names in the markets we serve. Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to us,which could reduce our gross profit, net income and cash flows.  We are susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry. The steel industry is very cyclical and is affected significantly by general economic conditions and other factors such as worldwideproduction capacity, fluctuations in steel imports/exports and tariffs. Steel prices are sensitive to a number of supply and demand factors. The prolonged duration of an economic downturn in the industry could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.  We may not be able to manage and integrate future capital expansionssuccessfully.  We have in the past and may in the future expand our existing facilities and equipment through acquisitions andcapital improvements. Expansion presents risks and requires that we expend both capital and personnel resources on such expansions, which may or may not be successful.  Equipment downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  Steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical equipment. Such equipment may incur downtime as a result of unanticipated failures or other events, such as fires or breakdowns. Our facilities haveexperienced, and may in the future experience, shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of such equipment failures or other events. Such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations, customer service levels and financialresults.  Increases in energy prices will increase our operating costs, and we may be unable to pass all of these increases on to ourcustomers in the form of higher prices for our products.  We use energy to manufacture and transport our products. Our operatingcosts increase if energy costs rise. We do not hedge our exposure to higher prices via energy futures contracts. Increases in energy prices will increase our operating costs and may reduce our profitability and cash flows if we are unable to passall of the increases on to our customers.  Steel companies are susceptible to changes in governmental policies and internationaleconomic conditions.  Governmental, political and economic developments relating to inflation, interest rates, taxation, currencyfluctuations, social or political instability, diplomatic relations, international conflicts and other factors may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Steel companies are subject to stringent environmental regulations, and we may be required to spend considerable funds in order to comply withsuch regulations.  We are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which weoperate. These laws and regulations, as interpreted by relevant agencies and the courts, impose increasingly stringent environmental protection standards regarding, among other things, air emissions, wastewater storage, treatment and discharges, theuse and handling of hazardous or toxic materials, waste disposal practices and the remediation of environmental contamination.  The costsof complying with environmental requirements could be significant and failure to comply could result in the assessment of civil and criminal penalties, the suspension of operations and lawsuits by private parties. In addition, these standards cancreate the risk of environmental liabilities, including liabilities associated with divested assets and past activities.   5 Durable goods account for a significant portion of our sales, and reduced demand from this sectorof the U.S. economy is likely to adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.  Downturns in demand for durable goods, or adecrease in the prices that we can realize from sales of our products to customers associated with this sector of the economy, would adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. Competition from other materials may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such as aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood. Additionalsubstitutes for steel products could adversely affect future market prices and demand for steel products.  Product liability claimscould adversely affect our operations.  We sell products to manufacturers who are engaged in selling a wide range of end products.Furthermore, our products are also sold to, and used in, certain safety-critical applications. If we were to sell steel products that were inconsistent with the specifications of the order or the requirements of the application, significantdisruptions to the customers production lines could result. There could also be consequential damages resulting from the use of such products. We have a limited amount of product liability insurance coverage, and a major claim for damagesrelated to products sold could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  OurCommon Stock is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.  The market price of our Common Stock could fluctuatesubstantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, quarterly operating results, trading volume in our Common Stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financialmarkets or other developments affecting our competitors or us.  In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volumefluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance and could have the same effect on our Common Stock. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation may discourage a third party from making a takeover proposal. Our articles of incorporation provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% of all of our outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote inelections of directors is required for a merger or consolidation of the Company with and into any other corporation or the sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. This may have the effect of discouraging atakeover proposal or tender offer not approved by management and the board of directors and could result in shareholders who may wish to participate in such a proposal or tender offer receiving less for their shares than otherwise might be availablein the event of a takeover attempt"

This reduction in the    supply of tubular products and coil material used in our tubular    operations from USS has had an adverse effect on our tubular    operations. The Company can make no assurances as to the amounts    of pipe and coil material that will be available from USS in the    future.     If, for any reason, NSC should curtail or discontinue deliveries    of coil inventory to us in quantities we need and at prices that    are competitive, our business could be negatively impacted.    Also, if the current reduction in the supply by USS of material    used in the manufacture of tubular products should continue for    a prolonged period or USS should discontinue completely such    deliveries, the negative impact on our business could be    significant. If, in the future, we are unable for a prolonged    period to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at    competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional    suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such metals from    alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery    schedules, which would have a material adverse effect on our    business, financial condition or results of operations. Our future    operating results may he affected if we were to lose one of our    significant customers.     In fiscal 2009, sales of pipe to USS accounted for approximately    30% of the Companys total sales. In February 2009, USS    announced that it was temporarily idling its plant at Lone Star,    Texas, due to weak market conditions. Since February 2009, the    Company has received few orders from USS. These circumstances    have had an adverse effect on the Companys business. A    prolonged reduction in sales to USS or the permanent loss of USS    as a customer could have a material adverse effect on the    Companys business. Our future    operating results may be affected by fluctuations in raw    material prices. We may not be able to pass on increases in raw    material costs to our customers.      Our principal raw materials are tubular products and steel    coils, which we purchase from a limited number of primary steel    producers. The steel industry as a whole is very cyclical, and    at times pricing can be volatile due to a number of factors    beyond our control, including general economic conditions, labor    costs, competition, import duties, tariffs and currency exchange    rates. This volatility can significantly affect our steel costs.    We are required to maintain substantial inventories to    accommodate the short lead times and    just-in-time    delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase    raw materials on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our    inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy    the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic    buying practices and market conditions. In an    4Table of Contents    environment of increasing raw material prices, competitive    conditions will impact how much of the steel price increases we    can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to    pass on future price increases in our raw materials to our    customers, the profitability of our business could be adversely    affected. Our business is    highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our    gross profit and net income.      The principal markets that we serve are highly competitive.    Competition is based primarily on the precision and range of    achievable tolerances, quality, price, raw materials and    inventory availability and the ability to meet delivery    schedules dictated by customers. Our competition in the markets    in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes,    some of which have greater financial and other resources than we    do and some of which have more established brand names in the    markets we serve. Increased competition could force us to lower    our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to    us, which could reduce our gross profit, net income and cash    flows. We are    susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry.      The steel industry is very cyclical and is affected    significantly by general economic conditions and other factors    such as worldwide production capacity, fluctuations in steel    imports/exports and tariffs. Steel prices are sensitive to a    number of supply and demand factors. The current conditions in    the U.S. economy have had an adverse effect on the U.S. steel    industry and on our business. The prolonged duration of these    conditions and any future downturns in the industry could have a    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or    results of operations. We may not be    able to manage and integrate future capital expansions    successfully.      We own a new steel processing and distribution operation in    Decatur, Alabama. In addition, we have made improvements to pipe    mill #2 at our TTP operations in Lone Star, Texas.    Expansion presents risks. We have expended and will continue to    expend both capital and personnel resources on such expansions,    which may or may not be successful. Equipment    downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business,    financial condition or results of operations.      Steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical    equipment. Such equipment may incur downtime as a result of    unanticipated failures or other events, such as fires or    breakdowns. Our facilities have experienced, and may in the    future experience, shutdowns or periods of reduced production as    a result of such equipment failures or other events. Such    disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations,    customer service levels and financial results. Increases in    energy prices will increase our operating costs, and we may be    unable to pass all of these increases on to our customers in the    form of higher prices for our products.      We use energy to manufacture and transport our products. Our    operating costs increase if energy costs rise. We do not hedge    our exposure to higher prices via energy futures contracts.    Increases in energy prices will increase our operating costs and    may reduce our profitability and cash flows if we are unable to    pass all the increases on to our customers. Steel companies    are susceptible to changes in governmental policies and    international economic conditions.      Governmental, political and economic developments relating to    inflation, interest rates, taxation, currency fluctuations,    social or political instability, diplomatic relations,    international conflicts and other factors may adversely affect    our business, financial condition or results of operations. Steel companies    are subject to stringent environmental regulations, and we may    be required to spend considerable amounts of money in order to    comply with such regulations.      We are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and    regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.    These laws and regulations, as interpreted by relevant agencies    and the courts, impose    5Table of Contents    increasingly stringent environmental protection standards    regarding, among other things, air emissions, wastewater    storage, treatment and discharges, the use and handling of    hazardous or toxic materials, waste disposal practices and the    remediation of environmental contamination.     The costs of complying with environmental requests could be    significant and failure to comply could result in the assessment    of civil and criminal penalties, the suspension of operations    and lawsuits by private parties. In addition, these standards    can create the risk of environmental liabilities, including    liabilities associated with divested assets and past activities. Durable goods    account for a significant portion of our sales, and reduced    demand from this sector of the U.S. economy is likely to    adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.      Downturns in demand for durable goods, or a decrease in the    prices that we can realize from sales of our products to    customers associated with this sector of the economy, would    adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. Competition from    other materials may have a material adverse effect on our    business, financial condition or results of operations.         In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such    as aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood.    Additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect    future market prices and demand for steel products. Product liability    claims could adversely affect our operations.      We sell products to manufacturers who are engaged in selling a    wide range of end products. Furthermore, our products are also    sold to, and used in, certain safety-critical applications. If    we were to sell steel products that were inconsistent with the    specifications of the order or the requirements of the    application, significant disruptions to the customers    production lines could result. There could also be consequential    damages resulting from the use of such products. We have a    limited amount of product liability insurance coverage, and a    major claim for damages related to products sold could have a    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or    results of operations. Our common stock    is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.         The market price of our common stock could fluctuate    substantially due to a variety of factors, including market    perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth,    quarterly operating results, trading volume in our common stock,    changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial    markets or other developments affecting our competitors    or us.     In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and    volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant    effect on the market price of securities issued by many    companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance    and could have the same effect on our common stock. Certain    provisions of our articles of incorporation may discourage a    third party from making a takeover proposal.      Our articles of incorporation provide that the affirmative vote    of the holders of 80% of all of our outstanding shares of stock    entitled to vote in elections of directors is required for a    merger or consolidation of the Company with and into any other    corporation or the sale, lease or other disposition of all or    substantially all of our assets. This may have the effect of    discouraging a takeover proposal or tender offer not approved by    management and the board of directors and could result in    shareholders who may wish to participate in such a proposal or    tender offer receiving less for their shares than otherwise    might be available in the event of a takeover attempt. "

In    recent periods, our Lone Star coil facility (LSCF)    has experienced a lack of supply of coil products from LSS, its    primary coil supplier. A further reduction in supply could have    an adverse effect on our coil segment operations. NSC continues    to supply our Hickman coil facility with steel coils in amounts    that are adequate for our purposes.

Accordingly, we purchase    raw materials on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our    inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy    the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic    buying practices and market conditions. In an environment of    increasing raw material prices, competitive conditions will    impact how much of the steel price increases we can pass on to    our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future    price increases in our raw materials to our customers, the    profitability of our business could be adversely affected.    4 Our business is    highly competitive, and increased competition could reduce our    gross profit and net income.      The principal markets that we serve are highly competitive.    Competition is based primarily on the precision and range of    achievable tolerances, quality, price, raw materials and    inventory availability and the ability to meet delivery    schedules dictated by customers. Our competition in the markets    in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes,    some of which have greater financial and other resources than we    do and some of which have more established brand names in the    markets we serve. Increased competition could force us to lower    our prices or to offer additional services at a higher cost to    us, which could reduce our gross profit, net income and cash    flow. We are    susceptible to the cyclicality of the steel industry.      The steel industry is highly cyclical and is affected    significantly by general economic conditions and other factors    such as worldwide production capacity, fluctuations in steel    imports/exports and tariffs. Steel prices are sensitive to a    number of supply and demand factors. The recurrence of a major    downturn in the industry may have a material adverse effect on    our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not be    able to manage and integrate future capital expansions    successfully.      As previously announced, we intend to establish a new steel    processing and distribution operation in Decatur, Alabama. In    addition, we have made improvements to pipe mill #2.    Expansion presents risks. We will expend both capital and    personnel resources on such expansions which may or may not be    successful. Equipment    downtime or shutdowns could adversely affect our business,    financial condition or results of operations.      Steel manufacturing processes are dependent on critical    equipment. Such equipment may incur downtime as a result of    unanticipated failures or other events, such as fires or    breakdowns. Our facilities have experienced, and may in the    future experience, shutdowns or periods of reduced production as    a result of such equipment failures or other events. Such    disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations,    customer service levels and financial results. Increases in    energy prices will increase our operating costs, and we may be    unable to pass all these increases on to our customers in the    form of higher prices for our products.      We use energy to manufacture and transport our products. Our    operating costs increase if energy costs rise. We do not hedge    our exposure to higher prices via energy futures contracts.    Increases in energy prices will increase our operating costs and    may reduce our profitability and cash flows if we are unable to    pass all the increases on to our customers. Steel companies    are susceptible to changes in governmental policies and    international economic conditions.      Governmental, political and economic developments relating to    inflation, interest rates, taxation, currency fluctuations,    social or political instability, diplomatic relations,    international conflicts and other factors may adversely affect    our business, financial condition or results of operations. Steel companies    are subject to stringent environmental regulations, and we may    be required to spend considerable amounts of money in order to    comply with such regulations.      We are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and    regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.    These laws and regulations, as interpreted by relevant agencies    and the courts, impose increasingly stringent environmental    protection standards regarding, among other things, air    emissions, wastewater storage, treatment and discharges, the use    and handling of hazardous or toxic materials, waste disposal    practices and the remediation of environmental contamination.     The costs of complying with environmental requests could be    significant and failure to comply could result in the assessment    of civil and criminal penalties, the suspension of operations    and lawsuits by private parties. In addition, these standards    can create the risk of environmental liabilities, including    liabilities associated with divested assets and past activities.    5 Durable goods    account for a significant portion of our sales, and reduced    demand from this sector of the U.S. economy is likely to    adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.      Downturns in demand for durable goods, or a decrease in the    prices that we can realize from sales of our products to    customers associated with this sector of the economy, would    adversely affect our profitability and cash flows. Competition from    other materials may have a material adverse effect on our    business, financial condition or results of operations.         In many applications, steel competes with other materials, such    as aluminum, cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood.    Additional substitutes for steel products could adversely affect    future market prices and demand for steel products. Product liability    claims could adversely affect our operations.      We sell products to manufacturers who are engaged to sell a wide    range of end products. Furthermore, our products are also sold    to, and used in, certain safety-critical applications. If we    were to sell steel that is inconsistent with the specifications    of the order or the requirements of the application, significant    disruptions to the customers production lines could    result. There could also be consequential damages resulting from    the use of such products. We have a limited amount of product    liability insurance coverage and a major claim for damages    related to products sold could have a material adverse effect on    our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our common stock    is subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.         The market price of our common stock could fluctuate    substantially due to a variety of factors, including market    perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth,    quarterly operating results, trading volume in our common stock,    changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial    markets or other developments affecting our competitors    or us.     In addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and    volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant    effect on the market price of securities issued by many    companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance    and could have the same effect on our common stock. Certain    provisions of our articles of incorporation may discourage a    third party from making a takeover proposal.      Our articles of incorporation provide that the affirmative vote    of 80% of all of our stock entitled to vote in elections of    directors is required for a merger or consolidation of the    Company with and into any other corporation or the sale, lease    or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets.    This may have the effect of discouraging a takeover proposal or    tender offer not approved by management and the board of    directors and could result in shareholders who may wish to    participate in such a proposal or tender offer receiving less    for their shares than otherwise might be available in the event    of a takeover attempt. "
