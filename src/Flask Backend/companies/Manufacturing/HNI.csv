2,HNI,HNI CORP,2024-02-27,"  Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered. If any of the following risks occur, the Corporation’s business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC RISKSUnfavorable economic and industry factors could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, or financial condition.Workplace, health care, and hospitality furnishings industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, business confidence, commercial construction, office vacancy rates, and new hospitality refurbishment rates. Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence workplace furnishings industry revenues. In addition, adoption of hybrid working models following the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant decrease in worker attendance at their office location. Despite office re-entry in many markets, office occupancy levels remain below historic levels. Lower office occupancy levels have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the demand for workplace furnishings.Residential building products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, housing inventory, home sales, overall employment levels, interest rates, home affordability, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income, and changing demographics. Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns, and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence residential building products industry revenues. Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for residential building products and have additional adverse effects on operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions, which may be caused by uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, rising or sustained inflation and interest rates, and potential economic recessions, could affect the Corporation’s business significantly, including reduced demand for products, insolvency of independent dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses, insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of products, and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations. In a recessionary economy, business confidence, service-sector employment, corporate cash flows, and residential and non-residential commercial construction often decrease, which typically leads to a decrease in demand for workplace furnishings and residential building products.The workplace, health care, and hospitality furnishings and residential building products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, the Corporation may not be successful in winning new business.The workplace, health care, and hospitality furnishings and residential building products industries are highly competitive. Many of the Corporation’s competitors in both industries offer similar products. Competitive factors include price, delivery and service, brand recognition, product design, product quality, strength of dealers and other distributors, and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders, and facility managers. In both industries, most of the top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders. The Corporation’s main competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage, which could make it difficult for the Corporation to win new business.In both the workplace furnishings and residential building products industries, the Corporation faces price competition from competitors and from new market entrants who may manufacture and source products from lower cost countries. Price competition impacts the Corporation’s ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower profit margins and adversely affect future financial performance.Changes in industry dynamics, including demand and order patterns from customers, distribution changes, or the loss of a significant number of dealers, could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, or financial condition.Consolidation among the Corporation’s customers may result in a smaller number of total customers, but an increase in large customers whose size and purchasing power give them increased leverage that may result in, among other things, decreases in average selling prices. In addition, further consolidations may lead to fluctuations in revenue, increases in costs to meet demands 10Table of Contentsof large customers, and pressure to accept onerous contract terms, and the Corporation’s business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.The Corporation sells products through multiple distribution channels, which primarily include independent dealers, national dealers, wholesalers, sales representatives, and eCommerce. Within these distribution channels, there has been, and may continue to be, consolidation. The Corporation relies on distribution partners to provide a variety of important specification, installation, and after-market services to customers. Some distribution partners may terminate their relationship with the Corporation at any time and for any reason. Loss or termination of a significant number of reseller relationships could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing products, resulting in a decline in sales, which may adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, or financial condition.In addition, individual dealers may not continue to be viable and profitable and may suffer from a lack of available credit. While the Corporation is not significantly dependent on any single dealer, if dealers go out of business or are restructured, the Corporation may suffer losses as the dealers may not be able to pay the Corporation for products previously delivered to them.The loss of a dealer relationship could negatively affect the Corporation’s ability to maintain market share in the affected geographic market and to compete for and service clients in that market until a new dealer relationship is established. Establishing a viable dealer in a market can take a significant amount of time and resources. The loss or termination of a significant dealer or a substantial number of dealer relationships could cause significant difficulties in marketing and distributing the Corporation’s products, resulting in a decline in sales and/or impairment of the Corporation’s contract assets related to distribution agreements with the respective dealers.Evolving trade policy between the United States and other countries may have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s business and results of operations.The Corporation has a global supply chain for products used in workplace furnishings and residential building products. Actions taken by the United States government to apply tariffs on certain products could have long-term impacts on existing supply chains. The situation could impact the competitive environment depending on the severity and duration of current and future policy changes. This may manifest in additional costs on the business, including costs with respect to products upon which the business depends. Increased costs could further lower profit margins as the Corporation may be challenged in effectively increasing the prices of its products, and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.Certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on goods that their countries import from the United States. Changes in United States trade policy could result in one or more foreign governments adopting trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for the Corporation to do business in those countries.The Corporation cannot predict the extent to which the United States or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes, or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of products in the future, nor can the Corporation predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on the business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for products, costs, customers, suppliers, and the United States economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation’s profitability may be adversely affected by increases in raw material and commodity costs as well as transportation and shipping challenges.Fluctuations in the price and availability of commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods could have an adverse effect on costs of sales, profitability, and ability to meet customers’ demand. The Corporation sources commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods from domestic and international suppliers. From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost and availability of commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods including steel have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, inflationary forces, natural disasters, labor disputes, military action, terrorism, and political unrest or instability. These factors could lead to price volatility or supply interruptions in the future. Profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material, component, and finished good costs increase and the Corporation is either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to customers.11Table of ContentsThe Corporation relies primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver products to customers. Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers has caused delays and may cause future delays in shipments and increase the cost to ship its products, which may adversely affect profitability. The Corporation also imports and exports products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports. Capacity-related and/or port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, have caused and could cause delayed receipt of products and components, which may adversely affect sales and profitability.STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKSIf customers do not perceive the Corporation’s products and services to be of good value, the Corporation’s brand and name recognition and reputation could suffer.The Corporation believes that establishing and maintaining good brand and name recognition and a good reputation is critical to its business. In certain parts of the market, promotion and enhancement of the Corporation’s name and brands will depend on the effectiveness of marketing and advertising efforts and on successfully providing design-driven, innovative, and high-quality products and superior services. If customers do not perceive the Corporation’s products and services to be design-driven, innovative and of high quality, its reputation, brand and name recognition could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business.The Corporation’s efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace demands may not be successful, which could limit sales growth or cause its sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of customers and keep pace with market trends and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety, and similar standards for the workplace and for product performance, the Corporation regularly introduces new workplace furnishings and residential building products. The introduction of new products requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the products, which may be affected by uncontrollable factors. The design and engineering of certain new products varies but can extend beyond a year, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance. The Corporation may face difficulties if it cannot successfully align itself with independent architects, home-builders, and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high-quality products consistent with the Corporation’s image and customers’ needs. Accordingly, the launch of a product may be later or less successful than originally anticipated, limiting sales growth or causing sales to decline.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation’s production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, global pandemics or epidemics, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, floods, and fires, could disrupt operations and the ability to produce or deliver products. Some of the Corporation’s production facilities, members, and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa located near the Mississippi River, and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area, such as flooding or severe storms, could have a significant adverse effect on the results of operations and business conditions. Further, several of the Corporation’s production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect operations and business conditions. Members are an integral part of the business and events such as those described above could negatively impact the availability of members reporting for work. In the event the Corporation experiences a temporary or permanent interruption in its ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any continuing disruption in the Corporation’s computer system could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customers’ orders, procure materials, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis, which could adversely affect relations with customers and potentially reduce customer orders or result in the loss of customers.The Corporation’s business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.The long-term effects of global climate change could present both physical risks and transition risks (such as regulatory, supply chain, or technology changes), which could be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could affect the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact the Corporation’s ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of the Corporation’s business at the quantities and levels the Corporation requires. Additionally, the Corporation has facilities located in areas that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, including flooding, and faces the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to its facilities and inventory as well as business interruption caused by such events. Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or 12Table of Contentsassociated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing the Corporation’s products and delay shipments of products to customers. The Corporation uses natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in its operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. The increased prevalence of global climate issues may result in new regulations that negatively impact the Corporation, including regulations limiting emissions from, or restricting the use of wood, coal, natural gas, or other fuel sources in, fireplaces and heating appliances, which may impair the Corporation’s ability to market and sell those products. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s costs or results of operations.A continued shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect the Corporation’s business and materially reduce earnings.The Corporation has experienced shortages of qualified labor across its operations. Outside suppliers that the Corporation relies upon have also experienced shortages of qualified labor. The success of the Corporation’s operations depends on its ability, and the ability of third parties upon which the Corporation relies, to identify, recruit, develop, and retain qualified and talented individuals in order to supply and deliver the Corporation’s products. A shortage of qualified labor could have a negative effect on the Corporation’s business. Member recruitment, development, and retention efforts may not be successful, which could result in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods. Any such shortage could decrease the Corporation’s ability to effectively produce workplace furnishings and residential building products and meet customer demand. Such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees (or higher costs to purchase the services of such third parties) and a corresponding reduction in the Corporation’s results of operations. A shortage of qualified labor in certain geographies, particularly with plant production workers, could result in increased costs from certain temporary wage actions, such as hiring and referral bonus programs. Such shortages for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operating results.The Corporation’s failure to retain its existing management team, maintain its engineering, finance, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect the Corporation’s business.The Corporation depends significantly on its executive officers and other key personnel. The Corporation’s success is also dependent on keeping pace with technological advancements and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities that meet customers’ changing needs. To do so, the Corporation must retain qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner. The Corporation focuses on continuous training, motivation, and development of its members, and it strives to attract and retain qualified personnel. Failure to retain the Corporation’s executive officers and retain and attract other key personnel could adversely affect the Corporation’s business.The Corporation’s strategy is partially based on growth through acquisitions or strategic alliances. Failure to properly identify, value, and manage acquisitions or alliances may negatively affect the Corporation’s business, results of operations and financial condition.One of the Corporation’s growth strategies is to supplement its organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances, which may include transactions with other manufacturers of workplace furnishings and residential building products or distributors of workplace furnishings and residential building products. The Corporation may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition or alliance opportunities, prevailing against competing potential acquirers, negotiating appropriate acquisition terms, obtaining financing, completing proposed acquisitions or alliances, or expanding into new markets or product categories. If the Corporation fails to effectively identify, value, consummate, or manage any acquired company, it may not realize the potential growth opportunities or achieve the financial results anticipated at the time of the acquisition or alliance. An acquisition or alliance could also adversely impact the Corporation’s operating performance or cash flow due to, among other things, the issuance of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition assumed liabilities, undisclosed facts about the business, or acquisition expense. The Corporation’s ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, the ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions. Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, or financial condition.The Corporation may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses and alliances.The benefits of acquisitions or alliances pursued as one of the Corporation’s growth strategies may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into operations. In addition, an acquisition or alliance may not perform as anticipated, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Corporation’s operations and cash flow. Acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including:13Table of Contents•diversion of management’s attention from operations;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•negative impact on member morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict the ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of the business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;•possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of a combined company; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect the financial results.The Corporation may not achieve the intended benefits of its recent merger with Kimball International.There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to successfully integrate Kimball International’s assets or otherwise realize the expected benefits of the transaction (including operating and other cost synergies). Difficulties in integrating Kimball International into the Corporation may result in the Corporation performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, in the failure to realize anticipated run-rate cost synergies and efficiencies in the expected time frame or at all, or in the difficulty or failure of utilizing available U.S. tax attributes, in which case the merger may not be accretive to earnings per share, may not improve the Corporation’s balance sheet position, may not enhance the Corporation’s ability to de-lever and may not generate additional free cash flow due to reduced cash tax payments. The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns; retaining key management and other employees; retaining or attracting business and operational relationships; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process and associated expenses; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; coordinating geographically separate organizations; unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; as well as potential unknown liabilities, or unforeseen expenses relating to integration.The future results of the Corporation may be adversely impacted if the Corporation does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the completion of the merger with Kimball International.The Corporation’s business is significantly larger than the pre-merger size of either the Corporation’s or Kimball International’s respective businesses. The Corporation’s ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management’s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two independent stand-alone companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the merger.The combined company incurred substantial expenses related to the completion of the merger of the Corporation with Kimball International and expects to continue to incur substantial expenses relating to their integration.In connection with the merger and ongoing integration efforts, the combined company incurred and is expected to continue to incur substantial expenses. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, potentially including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, revenue management, marketing and benefits. The substantial majority of these costs are non-recurring expenses related to the merger (including financing of the merger), facilities and systems consolidation. The Corporation may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. The Corporation and Kimball International also incurred transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business, and the execution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs. These incremental transaction- and merger-related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs.14Table of ContentsUncertainties associated with the merger with Kimball International may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, and the Corporation may have difficulty attracting and motivating management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the Corporation after the completion of the merger.The Corporation is dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of its management personnel and other key employees to execute its business plans. The success of the Corporation after the completion of the merger with Kimball International depends in part upon the ability of the Corporation to attract, motivate and retain key management personnel and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of the Corporation may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of the Corporation to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. In addition, no assurance can be given that the Corporation will be able to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees of the Corporation to the same extent that the Corporation and Kimball International have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees prior to the merger.The merger with Kimball International may result in a loss of customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, landlords and other business partners and may result in the termination of existing contracts.Some of the customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, landlords and other business partners of Kimball International may terminate or scale back their current or prospective business relationships with the Corporation. Some customers may not wish to source a larger percentage of their needs from a single company or may feel that the Corporation is too closely allied with one of its former competitors. If relationships with customers, distributors, suppliers, vendors, landlords and other business partners are adversely affected by the merger, or if the Corporation loses the benefits of the contracts of Kimball International, the Corporation’s business and financial performance could suffer.The combined company has significantly more indebtedness than the indebtedness of the Corporation prior to the merger.Upon completion of the merger, the Corporation incurred approximately $390.2 million in additional indebtedness and as of December 30, 2023 has consolidated indebtedness of approximately $435.8 million, up from $207.9 million before the merger. The increased indebtedness of the combined company in comparison to that of the Corporation on a historical basis may have the effect, among other things, of reducing the flexibility of the Corporation to respond to changing business and economic conditions and increasing borrowing costs.If the Corporation incurs additional indebtedness in future periods, the risks related to the substantial indebtedness of the Corporation after the completion of the merger may intensify.The market price of the Corporation’s common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of the Corporation’s common stock before the merger with Kimball International.As the businesses of the Corporation and Kimball International are different, the results of operations as well as the price of the Corporation’s common stock may be affected by factors different from those factors that affected the Corporation before the merger. Following the transaction, the Corporation faces additional risks and uncertainties that the Corporation or Kimball International may not have previously been exposed to as independent companies.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant amount of the Corporation’s total assets, and an impairment charge would adversely affect the Corporation’s financial results.The Corporation recorded $272.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the merger with Kimball International, and as of December 30, 2023, the Corporation’s goodwill and other intangible assets of $651.9 million represented approximately 34 percent of its total consolidated assets. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, the Corporation makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic performance, and the Corporation’s sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. If the Corporation experiences disruptions in its business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of its business, declines in the market value of equity, or other factors causing the Corporation’s goodwill or intangible assets to be impaired, the Corporation could be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges, which would adversely affect the results of operations. See ""Note 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"" for information on impairment charges.15Table of ContentsIncreasing healthcare costs could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, and financial condition. The Corporation provides healthcare benefits to the majority of its members and is self-insured. Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases the annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation’s international operations expose it to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.The Corporation manufactures, markets, and sells products in international markets.The Corporation’s international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including:•social and political turmoil, official corruption, and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting the ability to hire, retain, or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•the failure of the Corporation’s compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft and ransomware attacks;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices;•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and•changes to border taxes or other international tax reforms.These risks may be elevated given the current uncertainties around the impact of the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, ongoing disputes and increased tensions related to global trade, and complexities with foreign regulatory environments including the decreased ability of United States regulators to exercise oversight of subsidiaries of United States companies based in certain international jurisdictions.Additionally, although the Corporation primarily sells products and reports the financial results in United States dollars, increased business in countries outside the United States creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Paying expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of United States dollars, which may affect profits. In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the United States dollar would increase expenses that are denominated in that currency. Additionally, as the Corporation reports currency in the United States dollar, the financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where the Corporation has operations relative to the strength of the United States dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems that impose administrative and legal requirements, which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds among certain countries. If the Corporation is unable to provide financial support to the international operations in a timely manner, its business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.The Corporation periodically reviews foreign currency exposure and evaluates whether it should enter into hedging transactions. As of the date of this report and for the period presented, the Corporation has not utilized any currency hedging instruments.The Corporation’s sales to the United States federal, state, and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state, and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms, any of which factors could limit current or future business.The Corporation derives a portion of its revenue from sales to various United States federal, state, and local government agencies and departments. The ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the United States government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance. This government business is highly sensitive to 16Table of Contentschanges in procurement laws, national, international, state, and local public priorities, and budgets at all levels of government, which frequently experience downward pressure and are subject to uncertainty, including the potential for a temporary shutdown of the United States federal government.The Corporation’s contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The United States government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts either for their convenience or if the Corporation defaults by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. A termination arising out of default could expose the Corporation to liability and impede its ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government. Moreover, the Corporation is subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records, and reporting of costs. If the Corporation were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, it could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state, or local government contracting.The Corporation relies on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of the business and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation relies upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, as well as to manage numerous aspects of the business and provide information to management. Additionally, the Corporation collects and stores sensitive data of its customers, suppliers, and members in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches, hackers, and employee misuse. The Corporation has, and may in the future, face unauthorized attempts by hackers seeking to harm the Corporation or, as a result of industrial espionage or ransomware, to penetrate the Corporation’s network security and gain access to its systems, steal intellectual or other proprietary data, including design, sales or personally identifiable information, introduce malicious software, or interrupt the Corporation’s internal systems, manufacturing or distribution. Though the Corporation attempts to detect and prevent these incidents, it may not be successful. In addition, the Corporation is subject to data privacy and other similar laws in various jurisdictions. If the Corporation is the target of a cybersecurity attack, computer virus, physical or electronic break-in or similar disruption resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data of customers, suppliers, and members, the Corporation may be required to undertake costly notification procedures. The Corporation may also be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches. Any disruption of information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by systems, could result in legal claims and damages and loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information.The Corporation’s results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.The Corporation frequently provides public guidance on the expected results of operations for future periods. This guidance comprises forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions made at the time the Corporation provides such guidance. The guidance may not always be accurate. If, in the future, the results of operations for a particular period do not meet its guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if the Corporation reduces its guidance for future periods, the market price of its common stock could decline significantly.LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKSThe Corporation is subject to extensive environmental regulation and has exposure to potential environmental liabilities.Through the past and present operation and ownership of manufacturing facilities and real property, the Corporation is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, both domestic and abroad, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date, but compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at the Corporation’s real property sites which occurred prior to ownership, or the advent of environmental regulation may require additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.17Table of ContentsCosts related to product defects could adversely affect the Corporation’s profitability.The Corporation incurs various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs, and product liability costs. These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase. The Corporation uses chemicals and materials in products and includes components in products from external suppliers, which it believes to be safe and appropriate for their designated use. Harmful effects, however, may later become known, which could subject the Corporation to litigation and significant losses. The Corporation maintains reserves for product defect-related costs but these reserves may not be adequate to cover actual claims. Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.Iowa law and provisions in the Corporation’s charter and bylaws may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of its common stock.The Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation give the Corporation’s Board of Directors (""Board"") the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval. The existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest, or otherwise. Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued with other rights, including economic rights, senior to common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of the Corporation’s common stock.The Board is divided into three classes. The Corporation’s classified Board, along with other provisions of the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation or remove the Corporation’s directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to shareholders. Additionally, the Corporation may, in the future, adopt measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"") that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders. These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by the shareholders.An inability to protect the Corporation’s intellectual property could have a significant impact on the business.The Corporation attempts to protect its intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent, and other laws concerning proprietary rights, intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States. In some countries, the Corporation has limited protections, if any, for its intellectual property. The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Corporation, and patents, copyrights, trademarks, or service marks may not be issued on pending or contemplated applications. In addition, not all of the Corporation’s products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections. It is also possible that patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.In the past, certain products have been copied and sold by others. The Corporation tries to enforce its intellectual property rights, but has to make choices about where and how to pursue enforcement and where to seek and maintain intellectual property protection. In many cases, the cost of enforcing rights is substantial, and the Corporation may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits.If third parties claim that the Corporation infringes upon their intellectual property rights, the Corporation may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.The Corporation faces the risk of claims that it has infringed upon third parties’ intellectual property rights. Companies operating in the Corporation’s industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of the principal competitors have large patent portfolios. Prior to launching major new products in the key markets, the Corporation normally evaluates existing intellectual property rights. However, competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection, which is not, at the time of the evaluation, a matter of public knowledge. The Corporation’s efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause the Corporation to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require the Corporation to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand the 18Table of Contentsproducts or packaging, if feasible, or require the Corporation to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.FINANCING RISKSThe financing arrangements that the Corporation entered into in connection with the merger with Kimball International contain restrictions and limitations that may, under certain circumstances, significantly impact the Corporation’s ability to operate its business.The Corporation incurred significant new indebtedness in connection with its merger with Kimball International. The agreements governing the indebtedness that the Corporation incurred in connection with the merger, including, but not limited to, the Term Loan Credit Agreement may, under certain circumstances, impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Corporation. Specifically, the debt agreements restrict the Corporation’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted, sell, lease, license, or dispose of certain assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions, and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements. These restrictions may affect the Corporation’s ability to operate its business and may limit the Corporation’s ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.In addition, the agreements governing such indebtedness require the Corporation to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio financial covenant and consolidated interest coverage ratio financial covenant. The Corporation’s ability to comply with such covenants will depend on its ongoing financial and operating performance, which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond the Corporation’s control. The ability to comply with these covenants will also depend on the Corporation’s ability to successfully implement its overall business strategy and realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies.Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond the Corporation’s control could affect its ability to comply with the covenants contained in its financing agreements. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in its existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements. Under these circumstances, the Corporation might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of its obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on the Corporation’s ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair its ability to obtain other financing. The debt agreements also require the Corporation to maintain certain financial covenants.Rising interest rates and future increases will likely increase interest cost on the Corporation’s debt and could materially adversely impact the Corporation’s ability to refinance existing debt and limit its acquisition and development activities going forward.The U.S. Federal Reserve has raised the benchmark interest rate multiple times during 2023, and there can be no assurances that the rate will not further increase in the future. The agreements governing the indebtedness that the Corporation incurred in connection with the merger and otherwise, including, but not limited to, the Term Loan Credit Agreement, contain interest rates tied to various benchmark rates in effect at any given time, so as interest rates have increased, so has the Corporation’s interest costs for any new debt assumed in connection with the merger and in the normal course of our operations and any additional increases could further increase these costs. This increased cost could make the financing of any acquisition and development activity more costly, as well as lower future period earnings due to higher cost of borrowing.The Corporation may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.The Corporation’s capital requirements depend on many factors, including its need for capital improvements, tooling, research and development, and acquisitions. To the extent existing cash, available borrowings, and cash flows are insufficient to meet these requirements, the Corporation may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail its growth and reduce the Corporation’s assets. Future borrowings or financings may not be available under the credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable the Corporation to pay its debt or meet its liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available, could have unfavorable terms. In addition, financings could result in dilution to shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the Corporation’s common stock. If 19Table of Contentsthe need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult to raise the necessary capital"
0,HNI,HNI CORP,2023-02-28,"  Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered. If any of the following risks occur, the Corporation’s business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC RISKSUnfavorable economic and industry factors could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, or financial condition.Workplace furnishings industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, business confidence, commercial construction, and office vacancy rates. Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence workplace furnishings industry revenues. In addition, measures taken to limit spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a significant decrease in worker attendance at their office location, and have 9Table of Contentsfueled current work-from-home and hybrid work trends. Despite office re-entry in many markets, office occupancy levels remain below historic levels. Lower office occupancy levels have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on the demand for workplace furnishings.Residential building products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, housing inventory, overall employment levels, interest rates, home affordability, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income, and changing demographics. Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns, and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence residential building products industry revenues. Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for residential building products and have additional adverse effects on operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions, which may be caused by uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, rising or sustained inflation and interest rates, and potential economic recessions, could affect the Corporation’s business significantly, including reduced demand for products, insolvency of independent dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses, insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of products, and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations. In a recessionary economy, business confidence, service-sector employment, corporate cash flows, and residential and non-residential commercial construction often decrease, which typically leads to a decrease in demand for workplace furnishings and residential building products.The workplace furnishings and residential building products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, the Corporation may not be successful in winning new business.Both the workplace furnishings and residential building products industries are highly competitive. Many of the Corporation’s competitors in both industries offer similar products. Competitive factors include price, delivery and service, brand recognition, product design, product quality, strength of dealers and other distributors, and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders, and facility managers. In both industries, most of the top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders. The Corporation’s main competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage, which could make it difficult to win new business.In both the workplace furnishings and residential building products industries, the Corporation faces price competition from competitors and from new market entrants who may manufacture and source products from lower cost countries. Price competition impacts the ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower profit margins and adversely affect future financial performance.Changes in industry dynamics, including demand and order patterns from customers, distribution changes, or the loss of a significant number of dealers, could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, or financial condition.Consolidation among the Corporation’s customers may result in a smaller number of total customers, but an increase in large customers whose size and purchasing power give them increased leverage that may result in, among other things, decreases in average selling prices. In addition, further consolidations may lead to fluctuations in revenue, increases in costs to meet demands of large customers, and pressure to accept onerous contract terms, and the Corporation’s business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.The Corporation sells products through multiple distribution channels, which primarily include independent dealers, national dealers, wholesalers, and eCommerce channels. Within these distribution channels, there has been, and may continue to be, consolidation. The Corporation relies on distribution partners to provide a variety of important specification, installation, and after-market services to customers. Some distribution partners may terminate their relationship with the Corporation at any time and for any reason. Loss or termination of a significant number of reseller relationships could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing products, resulting in a decline in sales, which may adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, or financial condition.In addition, individual dealers may not continue to be viable and profitable and may suffer from a lack of available credit. While the Corporation is not significantly dependent on any single dealer, if dealers go out of business or are restructured, the Corporation may suffer losses as the dealers may not be able to pay the Corporation for products previously delivered to them.The loss of a dealer relationship could negatively affect the Corporation’s ability to maintain market share in the affected geographic market and to compete for and service clients in that market until a new dealer relationship is established. Establishing 10Table of Contentsa viable dealer in a market can take a significant amount of time and resources. The loss or termination of a significant dealer or a substantial number of dealer relationships could cause significant difficulties in marketing and distributing the Corporation’s products, resulting in a decline in sales and/or impairment of the Corporation’s contract assets related to distribution agreements with the respective dealers.Evolving trade policy between the United States and other countries may have an adverse effect on the Corporation’s business and results of operations.The Corporation has a global supply chain for products used in workplace furnishings and residential building products. Actions taken by the United States government to apply tariffs on certain products could have long-term impacts on existing supply chains. The situation could impact the competitive environment depending on the severity and duration of current and future policy changes. This may manifest in additional costs on the business, including costs with respect to products upon which the business depends. Increased costs could further lower profit margins as the Corporation may be challenged in effectively increasing the prices of its products, and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.Certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on goods that their countries import from the United States. Changes in United States trade policy could result in one or more foreign governments adopting trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for the Corporation to do business in those countries.The Corporation cannot predict the extent to which the United States or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes, or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of products in the future, nor can the Corporation predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on the business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for products, costs, customers, suppliers, and the United States economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation’s profitability may be adversely affected by increases in raw material and commodity costs as well as transportation and shipping challenges.Fluctuations in the price and availability of commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods could have an adverse effect on costs of sales, profitability, and ability to meet customers’ demand. The Corporation sources commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods from domestic and international suppliers. From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost and availability of commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods including steel, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, inflationary forces, natural disasters, labor disputes, military action, terrorism, and political unrest or instability. These factors could lead to price volatility or supply interruptions in the future. Profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material, component, and finished good costs increase and the Corporation is either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to customers.The Corporation relies primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver products to customers. Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers has caused delays and may cause future delays in shipments and increase the cost to ship its products, which may adversely affect profitability. The Corporation also imports and exports products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports. Capacity-related and/or port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, have caused and could cause delayed receipt of products and components. While these risks are ever present, the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to cause such delays, leading to manufacturing disruptions, increased expense from current and alternate shipping methods, and the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect sales and profitability.STRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKSIf customers do not perceive the Corporation’s products and services to be of good value, the Corporation’s brand and name recognition and reputation could suffer.The Corporation believes that establishing and maintaining good brand and name recognition and a good reputation is critical to its business. In certain parts of the market, promotion and enhancement of the Corporation’s name and brands will depend on the effectiveness of marketing and advertising efforts and on successfully providing design-driven, innovative, and high-quality 11Table of Contentsproducts and superior services. If customers do not perceive the Corporation’s products and services to be design-driven, innovative and of high quality, its reputation, brand and name recognition could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s business.The Corporation’s efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace demands may not be successful, which could limit sales growth or cause its sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of customers and keep pace with market trends and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety, and similar standards for the workplace and for product performance, the Corporation regularly introduces new workplace furnishings and residential building products. The introduction of new products requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the products, which may be affected by uncontrollable factors. The design and engineering of certain new products varies but can extend beyond a year; further time may be required to achieve client acceptance. The Corporation may face difficulties if it cannot successfully align itself with independent architects, home-builders, and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high-quality products consistent with the Corporation’s image and customers’ needs. Accordingly, the launch of a product may be later or less successful than originally anticipated, limiting sales growth or causing sales to decline.The Corporation’s financial condition and results of operation have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19.To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is continuing to cause, economic disruption both globally and in the United States. Such economic disruption lowered demand for workplace furnishings, which demand has not fully recovered in the wake of business slowdowns, shutdowns, and other preventative measures implemented in 2020 and 2021. The initial and continuing disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic created a material negative impact on the Corporation’s business, sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Other continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may include, but are not limited to:•labor shortages;•adverse impacts to the Corporation’s supply chain, which may increase operating costs and result in supply disruptions; and•impairment of independent dealers’, wholesalers’, and office product distributors’ ability to sell the Corporation’s products.In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Corporation’s members could adversely impact the Corporation’s sales and operations. At this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Corporation’s results is uncertain and depends on future developments, such as the emergence of variant strains of the virus, the continued effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, and office reentry trends in key markets. These future developments are uncertain, and could be material.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation’s production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, floods, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise, the ability to produce or deliver products. Several of the Corporation’s production facilities, members, and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa located near the Mississippi River, and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area, such as flooding or severe storms, could have a significant adverse effect on the results of operations and business conditions. Further, several of the Corporation’s production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect operations and business conditions. Members are an integral part of the business and events including an epidemic such as COVID-19 have reduced, and could negatively impact, the availability of members reporting for work. In the event the Corporation experiences a temporary or permanent interruption in its ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any continuing disruption in the Corporation’s computer system could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customers’ orders, procure materials, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis, which could adversely affect relations with customers and potentially reduce customer orders or result in the loss of customers.12Table of ContentsThe Corporation’s business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.The long-term effects of global climate change could present both physical risks and transition risks (such as regulatory, supply chain, or technology changes), which could be widespread and unpredictable. These changes over time could affect the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact the Corporation’s ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of the Corporation’s business at the quantities and levels the Corporation requires. Additionally, the Corporation has facilities located in areas that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, including flooding, and faces the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to its facilities and inventory as well as business interruption caused by such events. Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing the Corporation’s products and delay shipments of products to customers. The Corporation uses natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in its operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns. The increased prevalence of global climate issues may result in new regulations that negatively impact the Corporation, including regulations limiting emissions from, or restricting the use of wood, coal, natural gas, or other fuel sources in, fireplaces and heating appliances, which may impair the Corporation’s ability to market and sell those products. Any such events could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s costs or results of operations.A continued shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect the Corporation’s business and materially reduce earnings.The Corporation has experienced shortages of qualified labor across its operations. Outside suppliers that the Corporation relies upon have also experienced shortages of qualified labor. The success of the Corporation’s operations depends on its ability, and the ability of third parties upon which the Corporation relies, to identify, recruit, develop, and retain qualified and talented individuals in order to supply and deliver the Corporation’s products. A shortage of qualified labor could have a negative effect on the Corporation’s business. Member recruitment, development, and retention efforts may not be successful, which could result in a shortage of qualified individuals in future periods. Any such shortage could decrease the Corporation’s ability to effectively produce workplace furnishings and residential building products and meet customer demand. Such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees (or higher costs to purchase the services of such third parties) and a corresponding reduction in the Corporation’s results of operations. A shortage of qualified labor in certain geographies, particularly with plant production workers, could result in increased costs from certain temporary wage actions, such as hiring and referral bonus programs. Such shortages for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operating results.The Corporation’s failure to retain its existing management team, maintain its engineering, finance, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect the Corporation’s business.The Corporation depends significantly on its executive officers and other key personnel. The Corporation’s success is also dependent on keeping pace with technological advancements and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities that meet customers’ changing needs. To do that, the Corporation must retain qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner. The Corporation focuses on continuous training, motivation, and development of its members, and it strives to attract and retain qualified personnel. Failure to retain the Corporation’s executive officers and retain and attract other key personnel could adversely affect the Corporation’s business.The Corporation’s strategy is partially based on growth through acquisitions or strategic alliances. Failure to properly identify, value, and manage acquisitions or alliances may negatively affect the Corporation’s business, results of operations and financial condition.One of the Corporation’s growth strategies is to supplement its organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances, which may include transactions with other manufacturers of workplace furnishings and residential building products or distributors of workplace furnishings and residential building products. The Corporation may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition or alliance opportunities, prevailing against competing potential acquirers, negotiating appropriate acquisition terms, obtaining financing, completing proposed acquisitions or alliances, or expanding into new markets or product categories. If the Corporation fails to effectively identify, value, consummate, or manage any acquired company, it may not realize the potential growth opportunities or achieve the financial results anticipated at the time of the acquisition or alliance. An acquisition or alliance could also adversely impact the Corporation’s operating performance or cash flow due to, among other things, the issuance of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition assumed liabilities, undisclosed facts about the business, or acquisition expense. The Corporation’s ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, the ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital to 13Table of Contentscomplete the acquisitions. Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, or financial condition.The Corporation may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses and alliances.One of the Corporation’s growth strategies is to supplement its organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances. The benefits of acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into operations. In addition, an acquisition or alliance may not perform as anticipated, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Corporation’s operations and cash flow. Acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•negative impact on member morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict the ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of the business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;•possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of a combined company; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect the financial results.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant amount of the Corporation’s total assets, and an impairment charge would adversely affect the Corporation’s financial results.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, the Corporation makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic performance, and the Corporation’s sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors. If the Corporation experiences disruptions in its business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of its business, declines in the market value of equity, or other factors causing the Corporation’s goodwill or intangible assets to be impaired, the Corporation could be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges, which would adversely affect the results of operations. See ""Note 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"" for information on impairment charges.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, and financial condition. The Corporation provides healthcare benefits to the majority of its members and is self-insured. Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases the annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect the Corporation’s business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation’s international operations expose it to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.The Corporation manufactures, markets, and sells products in international markets.The Corporation’s international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including:•social and political turmoil, official corruption, and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting the ability to hire, retain, or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;14Table of Contents•the failure of the Corporation’s compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft and ransomware attacks;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices;•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and•changes to border taxes or other international tax reforms.These risks may be elevated given the current uncertainties around the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing disputes and increased tensions related to global trade, and complexities with foreign regulatory environments including the decreased ability of United States regulators to exercise oversight of subsidiaries of United States companies based in certain international jurisdictions.Additionally, the Corporation primarily sells products and reports the financial results in United States dollars; however, increased business in countries outside the United States creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Paying expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of United States dollars, which may affect profits. In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the United States dollar would increase expenses that are denominated in that currency. Additionally, as the Corporation reports currency in the United States dollar, the financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where the Corporation has operations relative to the strength of the United States dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems that impose administrative and legal requirements, which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds among certain countries. If the Corporation is unable to provide financial support to the international operations in a timely manner, its business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.The Corporation periodically reviews foreign currency exposure and evaluates whether it should enter into hedging transactions. As of the date of this report and for the period presented, the Corporation has not utilized any currency hedging instruments.The Corporation’s sales to the United States federal, state, and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state, and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.The Corporation derives a portion of its revenue from sales to various United States federal, state, and local government agencies and departments. The ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the United States government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance. This government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws, national, international, state, and local public priorities, and budgets at all levels of government, which frequently experience downward pressure and are subject to uncertainty, including the potential for a temporary shutdown of the United States federal government.The Corporation’s contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The United States government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts either for their convenience or if the Corporation defaults by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. A termination arising out of default could expose the Corporation to liability and impede its ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government. Moreover, the Corporation is subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records, and reporting of costs. If the Corporation were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, it could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state, or local government contracting.The Corporation relies on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of the business and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation relies upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, as well as to manage numerous aspects of the business and provide information to management. Additionally, the Corporation 15Table of Contentscollects and stores sensitive data of its customers, suppliers, and members in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches, hackers, and employee misuse. The Corporation has, and may in the future, face unauthorized attempts by hackers seeking to harm the Corporation or, as a result of industrial espionage or ransomware, to penetrate the Corporation’s network security and gain access to its systems, steal intellectual or other proprietary data, including design, sales or personally identifiable information, introduce malicious software, or interrupt the Corporation’s internal systems, manufacturing or distribution. Though the Corporation attempts to detect and prevent these incidents, it may not be successful. In addition, the Corporation is subject to data privacy and other similar laws in various jurisdictions. If the Corporation is the target of a cybersecurity attack, computer virus, physical or electronic break-in or similar disruption resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data of customers, suppliers, and members, the Corporation may be required to undertake costly notification procedures. The Corporation may also be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches. Any disruption of information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by systems, could result in legal claims and damages and loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information.The Corporation’s results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.The Corporation frequently provides public guidance on the expected results of operations for future periods. This guidance comprises forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions made at the time the Corporation provides such guidance. The guidance may not always be accurate. If, in the future, the results of operations for a particular period do not meet its guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if the Corporation reduces its guidance for future periods, the market price of its common stock could decline significantly.LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKSThe Corporation is subject to extensive environmental regulation and has exposure to potential environmental liabilities.Through the past and present operation and ownership of manufacturing facilities and real property, the Corporation is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, both domestic and abroad, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at the Corporation’s real property sites which occurred prior to ownership, or the advent of environmental regulation may require additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Costs related to product defects could adversely affect the Corporation’s profitability.The Corporation incurs various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs, and product liability costs. These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase. The Corporation uses chemicals and materials in products and includes components in products from external suppliers, which are believed to be safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may later become known, which could subject the Corporation to litigation and significant losses. The Corporation maintains reserves for product defect-related costs but there can be no certainty these reserves will be adequate to cover actual claims. Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.Iowa law and provisions in the Corporation’s charter documents may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of its common stock.The Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation give the Corporation’s Board of Directors (""Board"") the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval. The existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest, or otherwise. Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued 16Table of Contentswith other rights, including economic rights, senior to common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of the Corporation’s common stock.The Board is divided into three classes. The Corporation’s classified Board, along with other provisions of the Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation or remove the Corporation’s directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to shareholders. Additionally, the Corporation may, in the future, adopt measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"") that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders. These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by the shareholders.An inability to protect the Corporation’s intellectual property could have a significant impact on the business.The Corporation attempts to protect its intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent, and other laws concerning proprietary rights, intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States. In some countries, the Corporation has limited protections, if any, for its intellectual property. The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Corporation, and patents, copyrights, trademarks, or service marks may not be issued on pending or contemplated applications. In addition, not all of the Corporation’s products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections. It is also possible that patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.In the past, certain products have been copied and sold by others. The Corporation tries to enforce its intellectual property rights, but has to make choices about where and how to pursue enforcement and where to seek and maintain intellectual property protection. In many cases, the cost of enforcing rights is substantial, and the Corporation may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits.If third parties claim that the Corporation infringes upon their intellectual property rights, the Corporation may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.The Corporation faces the risk of claims that it has infringed upon third parties’ intellectual property rights. Companies operating in the Corporation’s industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of the principal competitors have large patent portfolios. Prior to launching major new products in the key markets, the Corporation normally evaluates existing intellectual property rights. However, competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection, which is not, at the time of the evaluation, a matter of public knowledge. The Corporation’s efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause the Corporation to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require the Corporation to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand the products or packaging, if feasible, or require the Corporation to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.FINANCING RISKSRestrictions imposed by the terms of the Corporation’s debt agreements limit the Corporation’s operating and financial flexibility.The Corporation’s credit facility and other financing arrangements limit the ability of the Corporation to finance operations, service debt, or engage in other business activities that may be in its interests. Specifically, the debt agreements restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted, sell, lease, license, or dispose of certain assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions, and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements. The debt agreements also require the Corporation to maintain certain financial covenants.The failure to comply with the obligations under the debt agreements may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the agreements. The Corporation cannot be certain it will 17Table of Contentshave sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on favorable terms or at all.The Corporation may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.The Corporation’s capital requirements depend on many factors, including its need for capital improvements, tooling, research and development, and acquisitions. To the extent existing cash, available borrowings, and cash flows are insufficient to meet these requirements, the Corporation may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail its growth and reduce the Corporation’s assets. Future borrowings or financings may not be available under the credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable the Corporation to pay its debt or meet its liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available, could have unfavorable terms. In addition, financings could result in dilution to shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the Corporation’s common stock. If the need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult to raise the necessary capital"
13,HNI,HNI CORP,2022-03-01,"  Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks occur, the Corporation's business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC RISKSUnfavorable economic and industry factors could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, or financial condition.Workplace furnishings industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction, and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, 9Table of Contentsincluding corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence workplace furnishings industry revenues.  In addition, measures taken to limit spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a significant decrease in worker attendance at their office location, and have fueled current work-from-home and hybrid work trends.  Lower office occupancy levels could have an adverse impact on the demand for workplace furnishings.Residential building products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, housing inventory, overall employment levels, interest rates, home affordability, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income, and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns, and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence residential building products industry revenues.  Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for residential building products and have additional adverse effects on operating results.A deterioration of economic conditions in the Corporation's key international markets, including China and India, could have adverse effects on the Corporation's international workplace furnishings sales and operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect the Corporation's business significantly, including reduced demand for products, insolvency of independent dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses, insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of products, and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations.  In a recessionary economy, business confidence, service-sector employment, corporate cash flows, and residential and non-residential commercial construction often decrease, which typically leads to a decrease in demand for workplace furnishings and residential building products.The workplace furnishings and residential building products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, the Corporation may not be successful in winning new business.Both the workplace furnishings and residential building products industries are highly competitive.  Many of the Corporation's competitors in both industries offer similar products.  Competitive factors include price, delivery and service, brand recognition, product design, product quality, strength of dealers and other distributors, and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders, and facility managers.  In both industries, most of the top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  The Corporation's main competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage, which could make it difficult to win new business.In both the workplace furnishings and residential building products industries, the Corporation faces price competition from competitors and from new market entrants who may manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts the ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower profit margins and adversely affect future financial performance.Changes in industry dynamics, including demand and order patterns from customers, distribution changes, or the loss of a significant number of dealers, could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, or financial condition.Consolidation among the Corporation's customers may result in a smaller number of total customers, but an increase in large customers whose size and purchasing power give them increased leverage that may result in, among other things, decreases in average selling prices.  In addition, further consolidations may lead to fluctuations in revenue, increases in costs to meet demands of large customers, and pressure to accept onerous contract terms, and the Corporation's business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.The Corporation sells products through multiple distribution channels, which primarily include independent dealers, national dealers, wholesalers, and eCommerce channels.  Within these distribution channels, there has been, and may continue to be, consolidation.  The Corporation relies on distribution partners to provide a variety of important specification, installation, and after-market services to customers.  Some distribution partners may terminate their relationship with the Corporation at any time and for any reason.  Loss or termination of a significant number of reseller relationships could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing products, resulting in a decline in sales, which may adversely affect the business, operating results, or financial condition.10Table of ContentsIn addition, individual dealers may not continue to be viable and profitable and may suffer from a lack of available credit.  While the Corporation is not significantly dependent on any single dealer, if dealers go out of business or are restructured, the Corporation may suffer losses as the dealers may not be able to pay the Corporation for products previously delivered to them.The loss of a dealer relationship could negatively affect the Corporation's ability to maintain market share in the affected geographic market and to compete for and service clients in that market until a new dealer relationship is established.  Establishing a viable dealer in a market can take a significant amount of time and resources.  The loss or termination of a significant dealer or a substantial number of dealer relationships could cause significant difficulties in marketing and distributing the Corporation's products, resulting in a decline in sales.Evolving trade policy between the United States and other countries may have an adverse effect on the Corporation's business and results of operations.The Corporation has a global supply chain for products used in workplace furnishings and residential building products.  Actions taken by the United States government to apply tariffs on certain products could have long-term impacts on existing supply chains.  The situation could impact the competitive environment depending on the severity and duration of current and future policy changes.  This may manifest in additional costs on the business, including costs with respect to products upon which the business depends.  Increased costs could further lower profit margins as the Corporation may be challenged in effectively increasing the prices of its products, and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.Certain foreign governments have imposed tariffs on goods that their countries import from the United States.  Changes in United States trade policy could result in one or more foreign governments adopting trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for the Corporation to do business in or import products from those countries.The Corporation cannot predict the extent to which the United States or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes, or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of products in the future, nor can the Corporation predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on the business.  The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for products, costs, customers, suppliers, and the United States economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation's profitability may be adversely affected by increases in raw material and commodity costs as well as transportation and shipping challenges.Fluctuations in the price and availability of commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods could have an adverse effect on costs of sales, profitability, and ability to meet customers' demand.  The Corporation sources commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods from domestic and international suppliers for both the workplace furnishings and residential building products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost and availability of commodities, raw materials, components, and finished goods including steel, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, inflationary forces, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism, and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to price volatility or supply interruptions in the future.  Profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material, component, and finished good costs increase and the Corporation is either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to customers.The Corporation relies primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver products to customers.  Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers has caused delays and may cause future delays in shipments and increase the cost to ship its products, which may adversely affect profitability.  The Corporation also imports and exports products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports.  Capacity-related and/or port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, have caused and could cause delayed receipt of products and components.  While these risks are ever present, the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to cause such delays, leading to manufacturing disruptions, increased expense from current and alternate shipping methods, and the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect sales and profitability.11Table of ContentsSTRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKSIf customers do not perceive the Corporation's products and services to be of good value, the Corporation's brand and name recognition and reputation could suffer.The Corporation believes that establishing and maintaining good brand and name recognition and a good reputation is critical to its business.  In certain parts of the market, promotion and enhancement of the Corporation's name and brands will depend on the effectiveness of marketing and advertising efforts and on successfully providing design-driven, innovative, and high-quality products and superior services.  If customers do not perceive the Corporation's products and services to be design-driven, innovative and of high quality, its reputation, brand and name recognition could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business.The Corporation's efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace demands may not be successful, which could limit sales growth or cause its sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of customers and keep pace with market trends and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety, and similar standards for the workplace and for product performance, the Corporation regularly introduces new workplace furnishings and residential building products.  The introduction of new products requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the products, which may be affected by uncontrollable factors.  The design and engineering of certain new products varies but can extend beyond a year; further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  The Corporation may face difficulties if it cannot successfully align itself with independent architects, home-builders, and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high-quality products consistent with the Corporation's image and customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of a product may be later or less successful than originally anticipated, limiting sales growth or causing sales to decline.The Corporation’s financial condition and results of operation have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak.To date, the COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant economic disruption both globally and in the United States.  Such economic disruption has lowered demand for workplace furnishings, and in turn create a material negative impact on the Corporation’s business, sales, financial condition, and results of operations.  Other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may include, but are not limited to:•labor shortages;•adverse impacts to the Corporation's supply chain, which may increase operating costs and result in supply disruptions;•disruptions to the Corporation’s manufacturing facilities and distribution centers, including through the effects of reductions in operating hours, and real-time changes in operating procedures, including for social distancing and quarantine protocols; and•the inability or impairment of independent dealers, wholesalers, and office product distributors to sell the Corporation’s products.In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Corporation’s members could adversely impact the Corporation’s sales and operations.  At this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Corporation’s results is uncertain and depends on future developments, such as the emergence of variant strains of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccines.  These future developments are highly uncertain, cannot be predicted, and could be material.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, floods, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise, the ability to produce or deliver products.  Several of the Corporation's production facilities, members, and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa located near the Mississippi River, and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area, such as flooding or severe storms, could have a significant adverse effect on the results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of the Corporation's production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of the business and events including an epidemic such as COVID-19 have reduced, and could 12Table of Contentsnegatively impact, the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event the Corporation experiences a temporary or permanent interruption in its ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in the Corporation's computer system could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customers' orders, procure materials, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis, which could adversely affect relations with customers and potentially reduce customer orders or result in the loss of customers.The Corporation’s business and operations are subject to risks related to climate change.The long-term effects of global climate change could present both physical risks and transition risks (such as regulatory, supply chain, or technology changes), which could be widespread and unpredictable.  These changes over time could affect the availability and cost of raw materials, commodities, and energy (including utilities), which in turn may impact the Corporation’s ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of the Corporation’s business at the quantities and levels the Corporation requires.  Additionally, the Corporation has facilities located in areas that may be impacted by the physical risks of climate change, including flooding, and faces the risk of losses incurred as a result of physical damage to its facilities and inventory as well business interruption caused by such events.  Furthermore, periods of extended inclement weather or associated flooding may inhibit construction activity utilizing the Corporation’s products and delay shipments of products to customers.  The Corporation uses natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in its operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns.  The increased prevalence of global climate issues may result in new regulations that negatively impact the Corporation, including regulations limiting emissions from, or restricting the use of wood, coal, natural gas, or other fuel sources in, fireplaces and heating appliances, which may impair the Corporation's ability to market and sell those products.  Any such events could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s costs or results of operations.A continued shortage of qualified labor could negatively affect the Corporation’s business and materially reduce earnings.During 2021, the Corporation experienced shortages of qualified labor across its operations. Outside suppliers that the Corporation relies upon have also experienced shortages of qualified labor.  The success of the Corporation’s operations depends on its ability, and the ability of third parties upon which the Corporation relies, to identify, recruit, develop, and retain qualified and talented individuals in order to supply and deliver the Corporation’s products.  A continued shortage of qualified labor could have a negative effect on the Corporation’s business.  Member recruitment, development, and retention efforts may not be successful, which could result in a continued shortage of qualified individuals in future periods.  Any such shortage could decrease the Corporation’s ability to effectively produce workplace furnishings and residential building products and meet customer demand. Such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees (or higher costs to purchase the services of such third parties) and a corresponding reduction in the Corporation’s results of operations.  In the current operating environment, the Corporation is experiencing a shortage of qualified labor in certain geographies, particularly with plant production workers, resulting in increased costs from certain temporary wage actions, such as hiring and referral bonus programs.  A continuation of such shortages for a prolonged period of time could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operating results.The Corporation's failure to retain its existing management team, maintain its engineering, finance, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect the Corporation's business.The Corporation depends significantly on its executive officers and other key personnel.  The Corporation's success is also dependent on keeping pace with technological advancements and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities that meet customers' changing needs.  To do that, the Corporation must retain qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner.  The Corporation focuses on continuous training, motivation, and development of its members, and it strives to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Failure to retain the Corporation's executive officers and retain and attract other key personnel could adversely affect the Corporation's business.The Corporation’s strategy is partially based on growth through acquisitions or strategic alliances. Failure to properly identify, value, and manage acquisitions or alliances may negatively affect the Corporation’s business, results of operations and financial condition.One of the Corporation's growth strategies is to supplement its organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances, which may include transactions with other manufacturers of workplace furnishings and residential building products or distributors of workplace furnishings and residential building products.  The Corporation may not be successful in identifying suitable acquisition or alliance opportunities, prevailing against competing potential acquirers, negotiating appropriate acquisition terms, 13Table of Contentsobtaining financing, completing proposed acquisitions or alliances, or expanding into new markets or product categories.  If the Corporation fails to effectively identify, value, consummate, or manage any acquired company, it may not realize the potential growth opportunities or achieve the financial results anticipated at the time of the acquisition or alliance.  An acquisition or alliance could also adversely impact the Corporation’s operating performance or cash flow due to, among other things, the issuance of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition assumed liabilities, undisclosed facts about the business, or acquisition expense. The Corporation's ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, the ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect the business, operating results, or financial condition.The Corporation may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses and alliances.One of the Corporation's growth strategies is to supplement its organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances.  The benefits of acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into operations.  In addition, an acquisition or alliance may not perform as anticipated, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to the Corporation’s operations and cash flow.  Acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•negative impact on member morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict the ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of the business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;•possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of a combined company; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect the financial results.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant amount of the Corporation's net worth, and an impairment charge would adversely affect the Corporation's financial results.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, the Corporation makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic performance, and the Corporation’s sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors.  If the Corporation experiences disruptions in its business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of its business, declines in the market value of equity, or other factors causing the Corporation's goodwill or intangible assets to be impaired, the Corporation could be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges, which would adversely affect the results of operations.  See ""Note 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"" for information on impairment charges recorded in 2020 and 2021.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, and financial condition. The Corporation provides healthcare benefits to the majority of its members and is self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases the annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation's international operations expose it to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.The Corporation manufactures, markets, and sells products in international markets, including China and India.  14Table of ContentsThe Corporation's international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including:•social and political turmoil, official corruption, and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting the ability to hire, retain, or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•the failure of the Corporation's compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft and ransomware attacks;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices;•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and•changes to border taxes or other international tax reforms.These risks may be elevated given the current uncertainties around the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing disputes and increased tensions related to global trade, particularly involving the United States and China, and complexities with foreign regulatory environments including the decreased ability of United States regulators to exercise oversight of subsidiaries of United States companies based in certain international jurisdictions.Additionally, the Corporation primarily sells products and reports the financial results in United States dollars; however, increased business in countries outside the United States creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of United States dollars, which may affect profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the United States dollar would increase expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as the Corporation reports currency in the United States dollar, the financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where the Corporation has operations relative to the strength of the United States dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems that impose administrative and legal requirements, which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds among certain countries.  If the Corporation is unable to provide financial support to the international operations in a timely manner, business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.The Corporation periodically reviews foreign currency exposure and evaluates whether it should enter into hedging transactions.  As of the date of this report and for the period presented, the Corporation has not utilized any currency hedging instruments.The Corporation's sales to the United States federal, state, and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state, and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.The Corporation derives a portion of its revenue from sales to various United States federal, state, and local government agencies and departments.  The ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the United States government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  This government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws, national, international, state, and local public priorities, and budgets at all levels of government, which frequently experience downward pressure and are subject to uncertainty.The Corporation's contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The United States government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts either for their convenience or if the Corporation defaults by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of default could expose the Corporation to liability and impede its ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, the Corporation is subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records, and reporting of costs.  If the Corporation were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, it could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state, or local government contracting.15Table of ContentsThe Corporation relies on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of the business and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation relies upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, as well as to manage numerous aspects of the business and provide information to management.  Additionally, the Corporation collects and stores sensitive data of its customers, suppliers, and members in data centers and on information technology networks.  The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to business operations and strategy.  These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches, hackers, and employee misuse. The Corporation has, and may in the future, face unauthorized attempts by hackers seeking to harm the Corporation or, as a result of industrial espionage or ransomware, to penetrate the Corporation’s network security and gain access to its systems, steal intellectual or other proprietary data, including design, sales or personally identifiable information, introduce malicious software, or interrupt the Corporation’s internal systems, manufacturing or distribution.  Though the Corporation attempts to detect and prevent these incidents, it may not be successful.  In addition, the Corporation is subject to data privacy and other similar laws in various jurisdictions.  If the Corporation is the target of a cybersecurity attack, computer virus, physical or electronic break-in or similar disruption resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data of customers, suppliers, and members, the Corporation may be required to undertake costly notification procedures.  The Corporation may also be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches.  Any disruption of information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by systems, could result in legal claims and damages and loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information.The Corporation's results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.The Corporation frequently provides public guidance on the expected results of operations for future periods.  This guidance comprises forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions made at the time the Corporation provides such guidance.  The guidance may not always be accurate.  If, in the future, the results of operations for a particular period do not meet its guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if the Corporation reduces its guidance for future periods, the market price of common stock could decline significantly.LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKSThe Corporation is subject to extensive environmental regulation and has exposure to potential environmental liabilities.Through the past and present operation and ownership of manufacturing facilities and real property, the Corporation is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, both domestic and abroad, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at the Corporation's real property sites which occurred prior to ownership, or the advent of environmental regulation may require additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Costs related to product defects could adversely affect the Corporation's profitability.The Corporation incurs various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs, and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  The Corporation uses chemicals and materials in products and includes components in products from external suppliers, which are believed to be safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may later become known, which could subject the Corporation to litigation and significant losses.  The Corporation maintains reserves for product defect-related costs but there can be no certainty these reserves will be adequate to cover actual claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.16Table of ContentsIowa law and provisions in the Corporation's charter documents may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of its common stock.The Corporation's Articles of Incorporation give the Corporation's Board of Directors (""Board"") the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval.  The existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest, or otherwise.  Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued with other rights, including economic rights, senior to common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of common stock.The Board is divided into three classes.  The Corporation's classified Board, along with other provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation or remove the Corporation's directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to shareholders.  Additionally, the Corporation may, in the future, adopt measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"") that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders.  These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by the shareholders.An inability to protect the Corporation's intellectual property could have a significant impact on the business.The Corporation attempts to protect its intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements.  Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent, and other laws concerning proprietary rights, intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States.  In some countries, the Corporation has limited protections, if any, for its intellectual property.  The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to the Corporation, and patents, copyrights, trademarks, or service marks may not be issued on pending or contemplated applications.  In addition, not all of the Corporation's products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections.  It is also possible that patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.In the past, certain products have been copied and sold by others.  The Corporation tries to enforce its intellectual property rights, but has to make choices about where and how to pursue enforcement and where to seek and maintain intellectual property protection.  In many cases, the cost of enforcing rights is substantial, and the Corporation may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits.If third parties claim that the Corporation infringes upon their intellectual property rights, the Corporation may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.The Corporation faces the risk of claims that it has infringed upon third parties’ intellectual property rights.  Companies operating in the Corporation's industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of the principal competitors have large patent portfolios.  Prior to launching major new products in the key markets, the Corporation normally evaluates existing intellectual property rights.  However, competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection, which is not, at the time of the evaluation, a matter of public knowledge.  The Corporation's efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights may not always be successful.  Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, cause the Corporation to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require the Corporation to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand the products or packaging, if feasible, or require the Corporation to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.FINANCING RISKSRestrictions imposed by the terms of the Corporation's debt agreements limit the Corporation's operating and financial flexibility.The Corporation's credit facility and other financing arrangements limit the ability of the Corporation to finance operations, service debt, or engage in other business activities that may be in its interests.  Specifically, the debt agreements restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted, sell, lease, license, or dispose of any assets, enter into certain transactions 17Table of Contentswith affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions, and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  The debt agreements also require the Corporation to maintain certain financial covenants.The failure to comply with the obligations under the debt agreements may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the agreements.  The Corporation cannot be certain it will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on favorable terms or at all.Phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR, may adversely impact interest rates affecting the Corporation.In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA""), a regulatory body in the United Kingdom, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021.  On December 4, 2020, the FCA announced a consultation to extend the cessation date for certain tenors of USD LIBOR to June 2023.  Such extension will apply to the USD LIBOR rates currently referenced in the Corporation's respective financial agreements.At this time the Corporation cannot predict the future impact of a departure from LIBOR as a reference rate; however, if future rates based upon the successor rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher than LIBOR rates as currently determined, it may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.The Corporation may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.The Corporation's capital requirements depend on many factors, including its need for capital improvements, tooling, research and development, and acquisitions.  To the extent existing cash, available borrowings, and cash flows are insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, the Corporation may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail its growth and reduce the Corporation's assets.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available under the credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable the Corporation to pay its debt or meet its liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available, could have unfavorable terms.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the Corporation's common stock.  If the need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult to raise the necessary capital"
3,HNI,HNI CORP,2021-03-02,"  Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks occur, the Corporation's business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC RISKSUnfavorable economic and industry factors could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, or financial condition.Workplace furnishings industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction, and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, 9Table of Contentsincluding corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence workplace furnishings industry revenues.  In addition, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, and other measures taken to limit spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a significant decrease in worker attendance at their office location, leading to an adverse impact on the demand for workplace furnishings.Residential building products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, housing inventory, overall employment levels, interest rates, home affordability, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income, and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns, and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence residential building products industry revenues.  Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for residential building products and have additional adverse effects on operating results.A deterioration of economic conditions in the Corporation's key international markets, including China and India, could have adverse effects on the Corporation's international workplace furnishings sales and operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect the Corporation's business significantly, including: reduced demand for products; insolvency of independent dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of products; and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations.  In a recessionary economy, business confidence, service-sector employment, corporate cash flows and residential and non-residential commercial construction often decrease, which typically leads to a decrease in demand for workplace furnishings and residential building products.The workplace furnishings and residential building products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, the Corporation may not be successful in winning new business.Both the workplace furnishings and residential building products industries are highly competitive.  Many of the Corporation's competitors in both industries offer similar products.  Competitive factors include price, delivery and service, brand recognition, product design, product quality, strength of dealers and other distributors, and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders, and facility managers.  In both industries, most of the top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  The Corporation's main competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage, which could make it difficult to win new business.In both the workplace furnishings and residential building products industries, the Corporation faces price competition from competitors and from new market entrants who may manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts the ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower profit margins and adversely affect future financial performance.Changes in industry dynamics, including demand and order patterns from customers, distribution changes, or the loss of a significant number of dealers, could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, or financial condition.Consolidation among the Corporation's customers may result in a smaller number of large customers whose size and purchasing power give them increased leverage that may result in, among other things, decreases in average selling prices.  In addition, further consolidations may lead to fluctuations in revenue, increases in costs to meet demands of large customers, and pressure to accept onerous contract terms, and the Corporation's business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.The Corporation sells products through multiple distribution channels, which primarily include independent dealers, national dealers, wholesalers, and e-Commerce.  Within these distribution channels, there has been, and may continue to be, consolidation.  The Corporation relies on distribution partners to provide a variety of important specification, installation, and after-market services to customers.  Some distribution partners may terminate their relationship with the Corporation at any time and for any reason.  Loss or termination of a significant number of reseller relationships could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing products, resulting in a decline in sales, which may adversely affect the business, operating results, or financial condition.In addition, individual dealers may not continue to be viable and profitable and may suffer from the lack of available credit.  While the Corporation is not significantly dependent on any single dealer, if dealers go out of business or are restructured, the Corporation may suffer losses as they may not be able to pay the Corporation for products previously delivered to them.  The adverse economic and operational effects of COVID-19 increase these risks.10Table of ContentsThe loss of a dealer relationship could also negatively affect the Corporation's ability to maintain market share in the affected geographic market and to compete for and service clients in that market until a new dealer relationship is established.  Establishing a viable dealer in a market can take a significant amount of time and resources.  The loss or termination of a significant dealer or a substantial number of dealer relationships could cause significant difficulties for the business in marketing and distributing the Corporation's products, resulting in a decline in sales.Evolving trade policy between the United States and other countries may have an adverse effect on the Corporation's business and results of operations.The Corporation has a global supply chain for raw materials and components used in workplace furnishings and residential building products.  Actions taken by the United States government to apply tariffs on certain products and materials, could have long-term impacts on existing supply chains.  The situation could impact the competitive environment depending on the severity and duration of current and future policy changes.  This may manifest in additional costs on the business, including costs with respect to raw materials and components upon which the business depends.  The increased costs have lowered and could further lower profit margins as the Corporation may be challenged in effectively increasing the prices of its products, and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.In addition, certain foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the United States.  Changes in United States trade policy could result in one or more foreign governments adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for the Corporation to do business in or import products from those countries.The Corporation cannot predict the extent to which the United States or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of raw materials or products in the future, nor can the Corporation predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on the business.  The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for products, costs, customers, suppliers, and the United States economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.The Corporation's profitability may be adversely affected by increases in raw material and commodity costs as well as transportation and shipping challenges.Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of the commodities, raw materials, and components could have an adverse effect on costs of sales, profitability, and ability to meet customers' demand.  The Corporation sources commodities, raw materials, and components from domestic and international suppliers for both the workplace furnishings and residential building products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality, and availability of commodities, raw materials, and components, including steel, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism, and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price volatility or supply interruptions in the future.  Profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material, and component costs remain high or escalate further, and the Corporation is either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to customers.The Corporation relies primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver products to customers.  Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers may cause delays in shipments and increase the cost to ship its products, which may adversely affect profitability.  The Corporation also imports and exports products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports.  Capacity-related and/or port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, could cause delayed receipt of products and components.  While these risks are ever present, the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to cause such delays, leading to manufacturing disruptions, increased expense from current and alternate shipping methods, or the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect sales and profitability.11Table of ContentsSTRATEGIC AND OPERATIONAL RISKSIf customers do not perceive the Corporation's products and services to be of good value, the Corporation's brand and name recognition and reputation could suffer.The Corporation believes that establishing and maintaining good brand and name recognition and a good reputation is critical to its business.  In certain parts of the market, promotion and enhancement of the Corporation's name and brands will depend on the effectiveness of marketing and advertising efforts and on successfully providing design-driven, innovative, and high-quality products and superior services.  If customers do not perceive the Corporation's products and services to be design-driven, innovative and of high quality, its reputation, brand and name recognition could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business.The Corporation's efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace demands may not be successful, which could limit sales growth or cause its sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of customers and keep pace with market trends and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety, and similar standards for the workplace and for product performance, the Corporation regularly introduces new workplace furnishings and residential building products.  The introduction of new products requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the products, which may be affected by uncontrollable factors.  The design and engineering of certain new products varies but can extend beyond a year; further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  The Corporation may face difficulties if it cannot successfully align itself with independent architects, home-builders, and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with the Corporation's image and customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of a product may be later or less successful than originally anticipated, limiting sales growth or causing sales to decline.The Corporation’s financial condition and results of operation have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak.A novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, and subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.  To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has surfaced in all regions around the world, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant economic disruption both globally and in the United States.  Such economic disruption has resulted and is expected to continue to result in a decrease in demand for workplace furnishings, and in turn create a material negative impact on the Corporation’s business, sales, financial condition, and results of operations.  Other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may include, but are not limited to:•disruptions to our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, including for social distancing, additional cleaning, and disinfection procedures;•the inability or impairment of independent dealers, wholesalers, and office product distributors to sell the Corporation’s products; and•adverse impacts to the Corporation's supply chain, which may increase operating costs and result in supply disruptions.In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Corporation’s members could adversely impact the Corporation’s sales and operations.  At this point, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Corporation’s results is uncertain and depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain, cannot be predicted and could be material.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise, the ability to produce or deliver products.  Several of the Corporation's production facilities, members, and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa located near the Mississippi River, and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area, such as flooding or severe storms, could have a significant adverse effect on the results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of the Corporation's production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of the business and events including an epidemic such as COVID-19 have reduced, and could 12Table of Contentsnegatively impact, the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event the Corporation experiences a temporary or permanent interruption in its ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in the Corporation's computer system could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customers' orders, procure materials, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis, which could adversely affect relations with customers and potentially reduce customer orders from customers or result in the loss of customers.The Corporation's failure to retain its existing management team, maintain its engineering, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect the Corporation's business.The Corporation depends significantly on its executive officers and other key personnel.  The Corporation's success is also dependent on keeping pace with technological advancements and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities that meet customers' changing needs.  To do that, the Corporation must retain qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner.  The Corporation focuses on continuous training, motivation, and development of its members, and it strives to attract and retain qualified personnel.  Failure to retain the Corporation's executive officers and retain and attract other key personnel could adversely affect the Corporation's business.The Corporation may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses and alliances.One of the Corporation's growth strategies is to supplement its organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances.  The benefits of acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into operations.  In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•negative impact on member morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict the ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of the business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;•possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of a combined company; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect the financial results.The Corporation's ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, the ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect the business, operating results, or financial condition.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant amount of the Corporation's net worth, and an impairment charge would adversely affect the Corporation's financial results.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, the Corporation makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic performance, and the Corporation’s sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors.  If the Corporation experiences disruptions in its business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of its business, declines in the market value of equity, or other factors causing the Corporation's goodwill or intangible assets to be impaired, the Corporation could be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges, which would adversely affect the results of operations.  See ""Note 6. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"" for information on impairment charges recorded in 2020.13Table of ContentsIncreasing healthcare costs could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, and financial condition. The Corporation provides healthcare benefits to the majority of its members and is self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases the annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation's international operations expose it to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.The Corporation manufactures, markets, and sells products in international markets, including China and India.  The Corporation's international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including:•social and political turmoil, official corruption, and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting the ability to hire, retain, or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•the failure of the Corporation's compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices;•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and•changes to border taxes or other international tax reforms.These risks may be elevated given the current uncertainties around the impact of the global pandemic; ongoing disputes and increased tensions related to global trade, particularly involving the U.S. and China; and complexities with foreign regulatory environments including the decreased ability of U.S. regulators to exercise oversight of subsidiaries of U.S. companies based in certain international jurisdictions.Additionally, the Corporation primarily sells products and reports the financial results in United States dollars; however, increased business in countries outside the United States creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of United States dollars, which may affect profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the United States dollar would increase expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as the Corporation reports currency in the United States dollar, the financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where the Corporation has operations relative to the strength of the United States dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems that impose administrative and legal requirements, which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds among certain countries.  If the Corporation is unable to provide financial support to the international operations in a timely manner, business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.The Corporation periodically reviews foreign currency exposure and evaluates whether it should enter into hedging transactions.  As of the date of this report and for the period presented, the Corporation has not utilized any currency hedging instruments.The Corporation's sales to the United States federal, state, and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state, and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.The Corporation derives a portion of its revenue from sales to various United States federal, state, and local government agencies and departments.  The ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the United States government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  This government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state, and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which frequently experience downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty.14Table of ContentsThe Corporation's contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The United States government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts either for their convenience or if the Corporation defaults by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of default could expose the Corporation to liability and impede its ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, the Corporation is subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records, and reporting of costs.  If the Corporation were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, it could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state, or local government contracting.The Corporation relies on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of the business and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation relies upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, as well as to manage numerous aspects of the business and provide information to management.  Additionally, the Corporation collects and stores sensitive data of its customers, suppliers, and members in data centers and on information technology networks.  The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to business operations and strategy.  These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to natural events and malicious activity.  Though the Corporation attempts to detect and prevent these incidents, it may not be successful.  In addition, the Corporation is subject to data privacy and other similar laws in various jurisdictions.  If the Corporation is the target of a cybersecurity attack, computer virus, physical or electronic break-in or similar disruption resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data of customers, suppliers, and members, the Corporation may be required to undertake costly notification procedures.  The Corporation may also be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches.  Any disruption of information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by systems, could result in legal claims and damages and loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information.The Corporation's results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.The Corporation frequently provides public guidance on the expected results of operations for future periods.  This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions made at the time the Corporation provides such guidance.  The guidance may not always be accurate.  If, in the future, the results of operations for a particular period do not meet its guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if the Corporation reduces its guidance for future periods, the market price of common stock could decline significantly.LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKSThe Corporation is subject to extensive environmental regulation and has exposure to potential environmental liabilities.Through the past and present operation and ownership of manufacturing facilities and real property, the Corporation is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, both domestic and abroad, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  In addition, the increased prevalence of global climate issues may result in new regulations that may negatively impact the Corporation.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed  in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at the Corporation's real property sites which occurred prior to ownership, or the advent of environmental regulation may require additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Costs related to product defects could adversely affect the Corporation's profitability.The Corporation incurs various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs, and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  The Corporation uses chemicals and materials in products and includes components in products from external suppliers, which are believed to be safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known, which could subject the Corporation to litigation and significant losses.  The Corporation maintains reserves for product defect-related costs but there can be no certainty 15Table of Contentsthese reserves will be adequate to cover actual claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.Iowa law and provisions in the Corporation's charter documents may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of its common stock.The Corporation's Articles of Incorporation give the Corporation's Board of Directors (""Board"") the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval.  The existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest, or otherwise.  Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued with other rights, including economic rights, senior to common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of common stock.The Board is divided into three classes.  The Corporation's classified Board, along with other provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation or remove the Corporation's directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to shareholders.  Additionally, the Corporation may, in the future, adopt measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"") that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders.  These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by the shareholders.An inability to protect the Corporation's intellectual property could have a significant impact on the business.The Corporation attempts to protect its intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements.  Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent, and other laws concerning proprietary rights, intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States.  In some parts of the world, the Corporation has limited protections, if any, for its intellectual property.  The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us, and patents, copyrights, trademarks, or service marks may not be issued on pending or contemplated applications.  In addition, not all of the Corporation's products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections.  It is also possible that patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.In the past, certain products have been copied and sold by others.  The Corporation tries to enforce its intellectual property rights, but has to make choices about where and how to pursue enforcement and where to seek and maintain intellectual property protection.  In many cases, the cost of enforcing rights is substantial, and the Corporation may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits.If third parties claim that the Corporation infringes upon their intellectual property rights, the Corporation may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.The Corporation faces the risk of claims that it has infringed upon third parties’ intellectual property rights.  Companies operating in the Corporation's industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of the principal competitors have large patent portfolios.  Prior to launching major new products in the key markets, the Corporation normally evaluates existing intellectual property rights.  However, competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection which is not, at the time of the evaluation, a matter of public knowledge.  The Corporation's efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights may not always be successful.  Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; cause the Corporation to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require the Corporation to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand the products or packaging, if feasible; or require the Corporation to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.16Table of ContentsFINANCING RISKSRestrictions imposed by the terms of the Corporation's debt agreements limit the Corporation's operating and financial flexibility.The Corporation's credit facility and other financing arrangements limit the ability of the Corporation to finance operations, service debt, or engage in other business activities that may be in its interests.  Specifically, the debt agreements restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted, sell, lease, license, or dispose of any assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions, and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  The debt agreements also require the Corporation to maintain certain financial covenants.The failure to comply with the obligations under the debt agreements may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the agreements.  The Corporation cannot be certain it will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on favorable terms or at all.Phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR, may adversely affect interest rates affecting the Corporation.In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (""FCA""), a regulatory body in the United Kingdom, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021.  On December 4, 2020, the FCA announced a consultation to extend the cessation date for certain tenors of USD LIBOR to June 2023.  Such extension will apply to the USD LIBOR rates currently referenced in the Corporation's respective financial agreements.At this time the Corporation cannot predict the future impact of a departure from LIBOR as a reference rate; however, if future rates based upon the successor rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher than LIBOR rates as currently determined, it may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.The Corporation may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.The Corporation's capital requirements depend on many factors, including its need for capital improvements, tooling, research and development, and acquisitions.  To the extent existing capital and future cash flows are insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, the Corporation may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail its growth and reduce the Corporation's assets.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available under the credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable the Corporation to pay its debt or meet its liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available, could have unfavorable terms.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the Corporation's common stock.  If the need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult to raise the necessary capital"
15,HNI,HNI CORP,2020-02-25,"  Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks occur, the Corporation's business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 9Table of ContentsUnfavorable economic and industry factors could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, or financial condition.Office furniture industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction, and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.Hearth products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, home affordability, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income, and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns, and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for hearth products and have additional adverse effects on operating results.A deterioration of economic conditions in the Corporation's key international markets, including China and India, could have adverse effects on the Corporation's international office furniture sales and operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect the Corporation's business significantly, including: reduced demand for products; insolvency of independent dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of products; and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations.  In a recessionary economy, business confidence, service-sector employment, corporate cash flows and residential and non-residential commercial construction often decrease, which typically leads to a decrease in demand for office furniture and hearth products.The office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, the Corporation may not be successful in winning new business.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive.  Many of the Corporation's competitors in both industries offer similar products.  Competitive factors include price, delivery and service, brand recognition, product design, product quality, strength of dealers and other distributors, and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders, and facility managers.  In both industries, most of the top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  The Corporation's main competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage, which could make it difficult to win new business.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, the Corporation faces price competition from competitors and from new market entrants who may manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts the ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower profit margins and adversely affect future financial performance.If customers do not perceive the Corporation's products and services to be of good value, the Corporation's brand and name recognition and reputation could suffer.The Corporation believes that establishing and maintaining good brand and name recognition and a good reputation is critical to its business. In certain parts of the market, promotion and enhancement of the Corporation's name and brands will depend on the effectiveness of marketing and advertising efforts and on successfully providing design-driven, innovative, and high-quality products and superior services.  If customers do not perceive the Corporation's products and services to be design-driven, innovative and of high quality, its reputation, brand and name recognition could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business.Changes in industry dynamics, including demand and order patterns from customers, distribution changes, or the loss of a significant number of dealers, could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, or financial condition.Consolidation among the Corporation's customers may result in a smaller number or large customers whose size and purchasing power give them increased leverage that may result in, among other things, decreases in average selling prices.  In addition, further consolidations may lead to fluctuations in revenue, increases in costs to meet demands of large customers, and pressure to accept onerous contract terms, and the Corporation's business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed. 10Table of ContentsThe Corporation sells products through multiple distribution channels, which primarily include independent dealers, national dealers, wholesalers, and e-Commerce.  Within these distribution channels, there has been, and may continue to be, consolidation.  The Corporation relies on distribution partners to provide a variety of important specification, installation, and after-market services to customers.  Some distribution partners may terminate their relationship with the Corporation at any time and for any reason.  The Corporation has experienced demand shift to direct fulfillment, reducing two-step distribution by wholesale partners.  The inability to provide increased direct fulfillment and/or the loss or termination of a significant number of reseller relationships could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing products, resulting in a decline in sales, which may adversely affect the business, operating results, or financial condition.In addition, individual dealers may not continue to be viable and profitable and may suffer from the lack of available credit.  While the Corporation is not significantly dependent on any single dealer, if dealers go out of business or are restructured, the Corporation may suffer losses as they may not be able to pay the Corporation for products previously delivered to them.  The loss of a dealer relationship could also negatively affect the Corporation's ability to maintain market share in the affected geographic market and to compete for and service clients in that market until a new dealer relationship is established.  Establishing a viable dealer in a market can take a significant amount of time and resources.  The loss or termination of a significant dealer or a significant number of dealer relationships could cause significant difficulties for the business in marketing and distributing the Corporation's products, resulting in a decline in sales.The Corporation's failure to retain its existing management team, maintain its engineering, technical, and manufacturing process expertise, or continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect the Corporation's business.The Corporation depends significantly on its executive officers and other key personnel.  The Corporation's success is also dependent on keeping pace with technological advancements and adapting services to provide manufacturing capabilities that meet customers' changing needs.  To do that, the Corporation must retain qualified engineering and technical personnel and successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner.  The Corporation focuses on continuous training, motivation, and development of its members, and it strives to attract  and retain qualified personnel.  Failure to retain the Corporation's executive officers and retain and attract other key personnel could adversely affect the Corporation's business.Evolving trade policy between the United States and other countries may have an adverse effect on the Corporation's business and results of operations.The Corporation has a global supply chain for raw materials and components used in office furniture and hearth products.  Actions taken by the United States government to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to apply tariffs on certain products and materials, could have long-term impacts on existing supply chains.  The evolving situation could impact the competitive environment depending on the severity and duration of current and future policy changes.  This may manifest in additional costs on the business, including costs with respect to raw materials and components upon which the business depends.  The increased costs have lowered and could further lower profit margins as the Corporation may not be able to pass on the additional costs by increasing the prices of its products, and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.In addition, certain foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the United States.  Changes in United States trade policy could result in one or more foreign governments adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for the Corporation to do business in or import products from those countries.The Corporation cannot predict the extent to which the United States or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of raw materials or products in the future, nor can the Corporation predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on the business.  The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for products, costs, customers, suppliers, and the United States economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.The Corporation's profitability may be adversely affected by increases in raw material and commodity costs as well as transportation and shipping challenges.Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of the commodities, raw materials, and components used in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on costs of sales, profitability, and ability to meet customers' demand.  The Corporation sources commodities, raw materials, and components from domestic and international suppliers for both the office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality, and availability of commodities, raw materials, and components, including steel, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws  11Table of Contentsand regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism, and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price volatility or supply interruptions in the future.  Profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material, and component costs remain high or escalate further, and the Corporation is either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to customers.The Corporation relies primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver products to customers.  Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers may cause delays in shipments and increase the cost to ship its products, which may adversely affect profitability.  Additionally, the Corporation imports and exports products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports.  Port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, could cause delayed receipt of products and components.  These delays could cause manufacturing disruptions, increased expense resulting from alternate shipping methods, or the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect sales and profitability.The Corporation's efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace demands may not be successful, which could limit sales growth or cause its sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of customers and keep pace with market trends and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety, and similar standards for the workplace and for product performance, the Corporation regularly introduces new office furniture and hearth products.  The introduction of new products requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the products, which may be affected by uncontrollable factors.  The design and engineering of certain new products varies but can extend beyond a year; further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  The Corporation may face difficulties if it cannot successfully align itself with independent architects, home-builders, and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with the Corporation's image and customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of a product may be later or less successful than originally anticipated, limiting sales growth or causing sales to decline.The Corporation may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses and alliances.One of the Corporation's growth strategies is to supplement its organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances.  The benefits of acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into operations.  In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•negative impact on member morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict the ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of the business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;•possible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of a combined company; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect the financial results.The Corporation's ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, the ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect the business, operating results, or financial condition.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant amount of the Corporation's net worth, and an impairment charge would adversely affect the Corporation's financial results.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably  12Table of Contentspossible an impairment may exist.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, the Corporation makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic performance, and the Corporation’s sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors.  If the Corporation experiences disruptions in its business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of its business, declines in the market value of equity, or other factors causing the Corporation's goodwill or intangible assets to be impaired, the Corporation could be required to recognize a non-cash impairment charge, which would adversely affect the results of operations.The Corporation is subject to extensive environmental regulation and has exposure to potential environmental liabilities.Through the past and present operation and ownership of manufacturing facilities and real property, the Corporation is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, both domestic and abroad, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  In addition, the increased prevalence of global climate issues may result in new regulations that may negatively impact the Corporation.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed  in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at the Corporation's real property sites which occurred prior to ownership, or the advent of environmental regulation may require additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, and financial condition. The Corporation provides healthcare benefits to the majority of its members and is self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases the annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation's international operations expose it to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.The Corporation manufactures, markets, and sells products in international markets, including China and India and plans to continue to grow internationally.  The Corporation primarily sells products and reports the financial results in United States dollars; however, increased business in countries outside the United States creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of United States dollars, which may affect profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the United States dollar would increase expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as the Corporation reports currency in the United States dollar, the financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where the Corporation has operations relative to the strength of the United States dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems that impose administrative and legal requirements, which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds among certain countries.  If the Corporation is unable to provide financial support to the international operations in a timely manner, business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.The Corporation periodically reviews foreign currency exposure and evaluates whether it should enter into hedging transactions.The Corporation's international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including:•social and political turmoil, official corruption, and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting the ability to hire, retain, or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•the failure of the Corporation's compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;•infrastructure disruptions; 13Table of Contents•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices;•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and•changes to border taxes or other international tax reforms.Restrictions imposed by the terms of the Corporation's debt agreements limit the Corporation's operating and financial flexibility.The Corporation's credit facility and other financing arrangements limits the ability of the Corporation to finance operations, service debt, or engage in other business activities that may be in its interests.  Specifically, the debt agreements restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license, or dispose of any assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions, and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  The debt agreements also require the Corporation to maintain certain financial covenants.The failure to comply with the obligations under the debt agreements may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the agreements.  The Corporation cannot be certain it will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on favorable terms or at all.Phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR, may adversely affect interest rates affecting the Corporation.In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.  It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established following 2021. At this time the Corporation cannot predict the future impact of a departure from LIBOR as a reference rate, however, if future rates based upon the successor rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher than LIBOR rates as currently determined, it may have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.Costs related to product defects could adversely affect the Corporation's profitability.The Corporation incurs various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs, and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  The Corporation uses chemicals and materials in products and includes components in products from external suppliers, which are believed to be safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known, which could subject the Corporation to litigation and significant losses.  The Corporation maintains reserves for product defect-related costs but there can be no certainty these reserves will be adequate to cover actual claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.The Corporation may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.The Corporation's capital requirements depend on many factors, including its need for capital improvements, tooling, research and development, and acquisitions.  To the extent existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, the Corporation may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail its growth and reduce the Corporation's assets.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available under the credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable the Corporation to pay its debt or meet its liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available, could have unfavorable terms.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the Corporation's common stock.  If the need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult to raise the necessary capital.The Corporation's sales to the United States federal, state, and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state, and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.The Corporation derives a portion of its revenue from sales to various United States federal, state, and local government agencies and departments.  The ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the United States government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  This government business is highly sensitive to  14Table of Contentschanges in procurement laws; national, international, state, and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which frequently experience downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty.The Corporation's contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The United States government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts either for their convenience or if the Corporation defaults by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of default could expose the Corporation to liability and impede its ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, the Corporation is subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records, and reporting of costs.  If the Corporation were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, it could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state, or local government contracting.The Corporation relies on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of the business and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation relies upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, as well as to manage numerous aspects of the business and provide information to management.  Additionally, the Corporation collects and stores sensitive data of its customers, suppliers, and employees in data centers and on information technology networks.  The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to business operations and strategy.  These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to natural events and malicious activity.  Though the Corporation attempts to detect and prevent these incidents, it may not be successful.  In addition, the Corporation is subject to data privacy and other similar laws in various jurisdictions.  If the Corporation is the target of a cybersecurity attack, computer virus, physical or electronic break-in or similar disruption resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data of customers, suppliers, and employees, the Corporation may be required to undertake costly notification procedures.  The Corporation may also be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches.  Any disruption of information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by systems, could result in legal claims and damages and loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information.The Corporation's results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.The Corporation provides public guidance on the expected results of operations for future periods.  This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions made at the time the Corporation provides such guidance.  The guidance may not always be accurate.  If, in the future, the results of operations for a particular period do not meet its guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if the Corporation reduces its guidance for future periods, the market price of common stock could decline significantly.Iowa law and provisions in the Corporation's charter documents may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of its common stock.The Corporation's Articles of Incorporation give the Corporation's Board of Directors (""Board"") the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval.  The existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest, or otherwise.  Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued with other rights, including economic rights, senior to common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of common stock.The Board is divided into three classes.  The Corporation's classified Board, along with other provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation or remove the Corporation's directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to shareholders.  Additionally, the Corporation may, in the future, adopt measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"") that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders.  These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by the shareholders. 15Table of ContentsAn inability to protect the Corporation's intellectual property could have a significant impact on the business.The Corporation attempts to protect its intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements.  Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent, and other laws concerning proprietary rights, intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States.  In some parts of the world, the Corporation has limited protections, if any, for its intellectual property.  The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us, and patents, copyrights, trademarks, or service marks may not be issued on pending or contemplated applications.  In addition, not all of the Corporation's products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections.  It is also possible that patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.In the past, certain products have been copied and sold by others.  The Corporation tries to enforce its intellectual property rights, but has to make choices about where and how to pursue enforcement and where to seek and maintain intellectual property protection.  In many cases, the cost of enforcing rights is substantial, and the Corporation may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits.If third parties claim that the Corporation infringes upon their intellectual property rights, the Corporation may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.The Corporation faces the risk of claims that it has infringed upon third parties’ intellectual property rights.  Companies operating in the Corporation's industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of the principal competitors have large patent portfolios.  Prior to launching major new products in the key markets, the Corporation normally evaluates existing intellectual property rights.  However, competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection which is not, at the time of the evaluation, a matter of public knowledge.  The Corporation's efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights may not always be successful.  Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; cause the Corporation to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require the Corporation to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand the products or packaging, if feasible; or require the Corporation to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise, the ability to produce or deliver products.  Several of the Corporation's production facilities, members, and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa located near the Mississippi River and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area, such as flooding or severe storms, could have a significant adverse effect on the results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of the Corporation's production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect the operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of the business and events including an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event the Corporation experiences a temporary or permanent interruption in its ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in the Corporation's computer system could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customers' orders, procure materials, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.The Corporation’s financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected by a pandemic or epidemic health crisis.In late 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in China.  At the time of this filing, the outbreak has been largely concentrated in China, although cases have been confirmed in other countries.  The Corporation conducts operations at various facilities throughout the world, including in China, and the inability to manufacture at a facility, either temporarily or permanently, may result in increased costs, adverse impacts to the Corporation's supply chain, lower revenues, and the loss of customers.  In addition, the impact of a pandemic or epidemic on the Corporation’s members and the global economy could adversely impact the Corporation’s sales and operations.  At this point, the extent to which the current coronavirus outbreak may impact the Corporation’s results is uncertain and depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. 16Table of Contents"
14,HNI,HNI CORP,2019-02-26,"  Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks occur, the Corporation's business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Unfavorable economic and industry factors could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, or financial condition.Office furniture industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction, and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.Hearth products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income, and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns, and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for hearth products and have additional adverse effects on operating results.A deterioration of economic conditions in the Corporation's key international markets, including China and India, could have adverse effects on the Corporation's international office furniture sales and operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect the Corporation's business significantly, including: reduced demand for products; insolvency of independent dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of products; and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations.The office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, the Corporation may not be successful in winning new business.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive.  Many of the Corporation's competitors in both industries offer similar products.  Competitive factors include price, delivery and service, product design, product quality, strength of dealers and other distributors, and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders, and facility managers.  In both industries, most of the top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  The Corporation's main competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage, which could make it difficult to win new business.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, the Corporation faces price competition from competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts the ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower profit margins and adversely affect future financial performance.Changes in industry dynamics, including demand and order patterns from customers, distribution changes, or the loss of a significant number of dealers, could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, or financial condition.The Corporation sells products through multiple distribution channels, which primarily include independent dealers, national dealers, and wholesalers.  Within these distribution channels, there has been, and may continue to be, consolidation.  The Corporation relies on distribution partners to provide a variety of important specification, installation, and after-market services to customers.  Some distribution partners may terminate their relationship with the Corporation at any time and for any reason.  The Corporation has  10Table of Contentsexperienced demand shift to direct fulfillment, reducing two-step distribution by wholesale partners.  The ability to provide increased direct fulfillment and/or the loss or termination of a significant number of reseller relationships could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing products, resulting in a decline in sales, which may adversely affect the business, operating results, or financial condition.Evolving trade policy between the United States and other countries may have an adverse effect on the Corporation's business and results of operations.The Corporation has a global supply chain for raw materials and components used in office furniture and hearth products.  Recent steps taken by the United States government to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to apply tariffs on certain products and materials, such as steel, could potentially disrupt the existing supply chains and impose additional costs on the business, including costs with respect to raw materials and components upon which the business depends.  The increased costs could lower profit margins as the Corporation may not be able to pass on the additional costs by increasing the prices of its products, and its business and results of operations may be adversely affected.In addition, certain foreign governments have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the United States.  Changes in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more foreign governments adopting responsive trade policies that make it more difficult or costly for the Corporation to do business in or import products from those countries.The Corporation cannot predict the extent to which the United States or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of raw materials or products in the future, nor can we predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on the business.  The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for products, costs, customers, suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results and financial condition.The Corporation's profitability may be adversely affected by increases in raw material and commodity costs as well as transportation and shipping challenges.Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of the commodities, raw materials, and components used in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on costs of sales, profitability, and ability to meet customers' demand.  The Corporation sources commodities, raw materials, and components from domestic and international suppliers for both the office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality, and availability of commodities, raw materials, and components, including steel, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism, and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price volatility or supply interruptions in the future.  Profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material, and component costs remain high or escalate further, and the Corporation is either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to customers.The Corporation relies primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver products to customers.  Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers may cause delays in shipments and increase the cost to ship its products, which may adversely affect profitability.  Additionally, the Corporation imports and exports products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports.  Port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, could cause delayed receipt of products and components.  These delays could cause manufacturing disruptions, increased expense resulting from alternate shipping methods, or the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect sales and profitability.The Corporation's efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace demands may not be successful, which could limit sales growth or cause its sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of customers and keep pace with market trends, the Corporation regularly introduces new office furniture and hearth products.  The introduction of new products requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the products, which may be affected by uncontrollable factors.  The design and engineering of certain new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  The Corporation may face difficulties if it cannot successfully align itself with independent architects, home-builders, and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image and our customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of a product may be later or less successful than originally anticipated, limiting sales growth or causing sales to decline. 11Table of ContentsThe Corporation may not be able to successfully integrate and manage its acquired businesses and alliances.One of the Corporation's growth strategies is to supplement its organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances.  The benefits of acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into operations.  In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict the ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of the business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect the financial results.The Corporation's ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, the ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect the business, operating results, or financial condition.The Corporation may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect the financial results.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  Poor performance in portions of the Corporation's business where goodwill or intangible assets, or declines in the market value of equity, may result in impairment charges, which would adversely affect the results of operations.The Corporation is subject to extensive environmental regulation and has exposure to potential environmental liabilities.Through the past and present operation and ownership of manufacturing facilities and real property, the Corporation is subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed  in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at the Corporation's real property sites which occurred prior to ownership, or the advent of environmental regulation may require additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect the Corporation's business, operating results, and financial condition. The Corporation provides healthcare benefits to the majority of its members and is self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases the annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect the business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation's international operations expose it to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.The Corporation manufactures, markets, and sells products in international markets, including China and India and plans to continue to grow internationally.  The Corporation primarily sells products and reports the financial results in U.S. dollars; however, increased business in countries outside the United States creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase expenses that are  12Table of Contentsdenominated in that currency.  Additionally, as the Corporation reports currency in the U.S. dollar, the financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems that impose administrative and legal requirements, which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds among certain countries.  If the Corporation is unable to provide financial support to the international operations in a timely manner, business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.The Corporation periodically reviews foreign currency exposure and evaluates whether it should enter into hedging transactions.The Corporation's international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including:•social and political turmoil, official corruption, and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting the ability to hire, retain, or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•the failure of the Corporation's compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices;•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and•changes to border taxes or other international tax reforms.Restrictions imposed by the terms of the Corporation's debt agreements may limit operating and financial flexibility.The Corporation's credit facility and other financing arrangements may limit the ability to finance operations, service debt, or engage in other business activities that may be in its interests.  Specifically, the debt agreements may restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license, or dispose of any assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions, and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  The debt agreements also require the Corporation to maintain certain financial covenants.The failure to comply with the obligations under the debt agreements may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the agreements.  The Corporation cannot be certain it will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on favorable terms or at all.Costs related to product defects could adversely affect the Corporation's profitability.The Corporation incurs various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs, and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  The Corporation uses chemicals and materials in products and includes components in products from external suppliers, which are believed to be safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known, which could subject the Corporation to litigation and significant losses.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs but cannot be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.The Corporation may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.The Corporation's capital requirements depend on many factors, including its need for capital improvements, tooling, new product development, and acquisitions.  To the extent existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail its growth and reduce its assets.  Future borrowings or financings  13Table of Contentsmay not be available under the credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable the Corporation to pay its debt or meet its liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available, could have unfavorable terms.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of the Corporation's common stock.  If the need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult to raise the necessary capital.The Corporation's sales to the U.S. federal, state, and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state, and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.The Corporation derives a portion of its revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state, and local government agencies and departments.  The ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  This government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state, and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which have recently experienced downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty.The Corporation's contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of default could expose the Corporation to liability and impede its ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records, and reporting of costs.  If the Corporation were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, it could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state, or local government contracting.The Corporation relies on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of the business and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect business, operating results, and financial condition.The Corporation relies upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, as well as to manage numerous aspects of the business and provide information to management.  Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers, suppliers, and employees in data centers and on information technology networks.  The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to business operations and strategy.  These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to natural events and malicious activity.  Though the Corporation attempts to detect and prevent these incidents, it may not be successful.  In addition, the Corporation is subject to data privacy and other similar laws in various jurisdictions.  If the Corporation is the target of a cybersecurity attack, computer virus, physical or electronic break-in or similar disruption resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data of customers, suppliers, and employees, the Corporation may be required to undertake costly notification procedures.  The Corporation may also be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm and litigation, caused by any breaches.  Any disruption of information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by systems, could result in legal claims and damages and loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information.The Corporation's results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.The Corporation provides public guidance on the expected results of operations for future periods.  This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions made at the time we provide such guidance.  The guidance may not always be accurate.  If, in the future, the results of operations for a particular period do not meet its guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if the Corporation reduces its guidance for future periods, the market price of common stock could decline significantly.Iowa law and provisions in the Corporation's charter documents may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of its common stock.The Corporation's Articles of Incorporation give the Board of Directors the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval.  The existence of  14Table of Contentsthis preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest, or otherwise.  Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued with other rights, including economic rights, senior to common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of common stock.The Corporation's Board of Directors is divided into three classes.  The Corporation's classified Board, along with other provisions of the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Corporation or remove the Corporation's directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to shareholders.  Additionally, the Corporation may, in the future, adopt measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"") that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders.  These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by the shareholders.An inability to protect the Corporation's intellectual property could have a significant impact on the business.The Corporation attempts to protect its intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements.  Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent, and other laws concerning proprietary rights, intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States.  In some parts of the world, the Corporation has limited protections, if any, for its intellectual property.  The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us, and patents, copyrights, trademarks, or service marks may not be issued on pending or contemplated applications.  In addition, not all of the Corporation's products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections.  It is also possible that patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.In the past, certain products have been copied and sold by others.  The Corporation tries to enforce its intellectual property rights, but has to make choices about where and how to pursue enforcement and where to seek and maintain intellectual property protection.  In many cases, the cost of enforcing rights is substantial, and the Corporation may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits.If third parties claim that the Corporation infringes upon their intellectual property rights, the Corporation may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.The Corporation faces the risk of claims that it has infringed upon third parties’ intellectual property rights.  Companies operating in our industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of the principal competitors have large patent portfolios.  Prior to launching major new products in the key markets, we normally evaluate existing intellectual property rights.  However, competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection which is not, at the time of the evaluation, a matter of public knowledge.  The Corporation's efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights may not always be successful.  Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; cause the Corporation to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require the Corporation to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand the products or packaging, if feasible; or require the Corporation to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise, the ability to produce or deliver products.  Several of the Corporation's production facilities, members, and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area could have a significant adverse effect on the results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of our production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect the operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of the business and events including an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in the Corporation's computer system could adversely affect the ability to receive and process customers' orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers. 15Table of Contents"
12,HNI,HNI CORP,2018-02-23,"  Risk Factors
The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Unfavorable economic and industry factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.Office furniture industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction, and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.Hearth products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income, and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns, and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the recovery in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results.  Additionally, the decline in oil and other fuel prices has negatively impacted demand for pellet stoves and we expect demand to remain soft in the pellet business while oil and other fuel prices remain low.Economic growth remains solid in our key international markets, including China and India.  A deterioration of economic conditions in those markets could have adverse effects on our international office furniture sales and operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect our business significantly, including: reduced demand for products; insolvency of our independent dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations. 10Table of ContentsThe office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, we may not be successful in winning new business.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive.  Many of our competitors in both industries offer similar products.  Competitive factors include price, delivery and service, product design, product quality, strength of dealers and other distributors, and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders, and facility managers.  In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  Our main competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products, which could make it difficult for us to win new business.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we face price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins and adversely affect our future financial performance.Changes in industry dynamics, including demand and order patterns from our customers, distribution changes, or the loss of a significant number of dealers, could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.We sell our products through multiple distribution channels, which primarily includes independent dealers, national dealers, and wholesalers.  Within these distribution channels, there has been, and may continue to be, consolidation.  We rely on distribution partners to provide a variety of important specification, installation, and after-market services to our customers.  Some of our distribution partners may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason.  We have experienced demand shift to direct fulfillment, reducing two-step distribution that was previously provided by wholesale partners.  Our ability to provide increased direct fulfillment and/or the loss or termination of a significant number of reseller relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.Our profitability may be adversely affected by increases in raw material and commodity costs as well as transportation and shipping challenges.Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of the commodities, raw materials, and components used in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales, profitability, and our ability to meet customers' demand.  We source commodities, raw materials, and components from domestic and international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality, and availability of commodities, raw materials, and components, including steel, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism, and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future.  Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material, and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers.We rely primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver our products to customers.  Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers may cause delays in our shipments and increase the cost to ship our products, which may adversely affect our profitability.  Additionally, we import and export products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports.  Port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, could cause delayed receipt of our products and components.  These delays could cause manufacturing disruptions, increased expense resulting from alternate shipping methods, or the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability. 11Table of ContentsOur efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace demands may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of our customers and keep pace with market trends, we regularly introduce new office furniture and hearth products.  The introduction of new products requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of the products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  The design and engineering of certain new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  We may face difficulties if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders, and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image and our customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of a product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated, limiting our sales growth or causing our sales to decline.Our implementation and use of a new business software system, and accompanying transformation of our business processes, could result in problems that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.We are engaged in a multi-year, broad-based program, which we refer to as business systems transformation (""BST"").  The BST initiative includes the introduction of a new software system along with process changes and new ways to work, which simplify and streamline our business processes.  In 2016 and 2017, we implemented BST across several of our smaller operating companies.  The remaining in-scope domestic office furniture operations switched over to the new system on February 1, 2018.  At this early stage of implementation, there can be no assurance issues relating to BST will not occur, including compatibility issues, integration challenges and further delays, and higher than expected implementation costs.  While not experienced to date, BST may not function properly or deliver the projected benefits, which could significantly disrupt our business, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, generate management and financial reports, and otherwise run our business.Our continuing activities to reduce structural costs may result in customer disruption, may distract management from other activities, and may not achieve the desired results.As part of our commitment to taking structural cost out of our business, we regularly close, reconfigure, or transform manufacturing and distribution facilities.  Over the past several years, we have closed a number of facilities in the United States and internationally.  We have implemented, and will continue to implement, restructuring actions to transform our business and reduce our manufacturing footprint.  These actions may take longer than anticipated, prove costlier than expected, and may distract management from other activities.  If we do not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring activities, our financial condition and ability to meet customer needs could be negatively affected.We may not be able to successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses and alliances.One of our growth strategies is to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions and strategic alliances.  The benefits of acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations.  In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our financial results.Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. 12Table of ContentsWe may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our financial results.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  Poor performance in portions of our business where we have goodwill or intangible assets, or declines in the market value of our equity, may result in impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities.Through our past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property, we are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water, and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership, or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. We provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members and are self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases our annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.Our international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.We manufacture, market, and sell our products in international markets, including China and India.  We plan to continue to grow internationally.  We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, our increased business in countries outside the United States exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems that impose administrative and legal requirements, which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds into certain countries.  If we are unable to provide financial support to our international operations in a timely manner, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.We periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions.Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including:•social and political turmoil, official corruption, and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain, or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•the failure of our compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices;•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and•changes to border taxes or other international tax reforms. 13Table of ContentsRestrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility may limit our operating and financial flexibility.Our credit facility and other financing arrangements may limit our ability to finance operations, service debt, or engage in other business activities that may be in our interests.  Specifically, our credit facility may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license, or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions, and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  Our credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants.Our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility.  We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all.Costs related to product defects could adversely affect our profitability.We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs, and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  We use chemicals and materials in our products and include components in our products from external suppliers, which we believe are safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known, which could subject us to litigation and significant losses.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs but cannot be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual claims.  We also purchase insurance coverage and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates and actuarial assumptions, but we cannot be certain insurance would cover all losses related to product claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including our need for capital improvements, tooling, new product development, and acquisitions.  To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available, could have terms unfavorable to us.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our common stock.  If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.Our sales to the U.S. federal, state, and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state, and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state, and local government agencies and departments.  Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state, and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which have recently experienced downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty.Our contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records, and reporting of costs.  If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state, or local government contracting. 14Table of ContentsWe rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect our business.We rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, as well as to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide information to management.  Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers, suppliers, and employees in data centers and on information technology networks.  The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy.  These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to natural events and malicious activity.  Though we attempt to detect and prevent these incidents, we may not be successful.  Any disruption of our information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by our systems, could result in legal claims and damages and loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information.Our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.We provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods.  This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance.  Our guidance may not always be accurate.  If, in the future, our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.Iowa law and provisions in our charter documents may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.Our Articles of Incorporation give our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval.  The existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest, or otherwise.  Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued with other rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes.  Our classified Board, along with other provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or remove our directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders.  Additionally, we may, in the future, adopt measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or ""poison pill"") that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders.  These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by our shareholders.An inability to protect our intellectual property could have a significant impact on our business.We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements.  Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent, and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States.  In some parts of the world, we have limited protections, if any, for our intellectual property.  The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us, and patents, copyrights, trademarks, or service marks may not be issued on our pending or contemplated applications.  In addition, not all of our products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections.  It is also possible that our patents, copyrights, trademarks, and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed, or circumvented.In the past, certain of our products have been copied and sold by others.  We try to enforce our intellectual property rights, but we have to make choices about where and how we pursue enforcement and where we seek and maintain intellectual property protection.  In many cases, the cost of enforcing our rights is substantial, and we may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits. 15Table of ContentsIf third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.We face the risk of claims that we have infringed upon third parties’ intellectual property rights.  Companies operating in our industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of our principal competitors have large patent portfolios.  Prior to launching major new products in our key markets, we normally evaluate existing intellectual property rights.  However, our competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection which is not, at the time of our evaluation, a matter of public knowledge.  Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights may not always be successful.  Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing, or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand our products or packaging, if feasible; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events, or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions, and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise, the ability to produce or deliver our products.  Several of our production facilities, members, and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of our production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect our operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of our business and events including an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers' orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis, and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.  We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event"
11,HNI,HNI CORP,2017-02-24,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSThe following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.The existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors, or deterioration of economic conditions, for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition.Office furniture industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues. Hearth products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the recovery in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results.  Additionally, the decline in oil and other fuel prices has negatively impacted demand for pellet stoves and we expect demand to remain soft in the pellet business while oil and other fuel prices remain low.Economic growth has slowed, and may continue to slow, in several key international markets, including China and India, which could have adverse effects on our international office furniture sales and our operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect our business significantly, including:  reduced demand for products; insolvency of our dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations.We may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist. We test for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year and whenever indicators of impairment exist.  We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment, and accordingly, an impairment is recognized.We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.  Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of longer term, broad market trends.  We combine this trend data with estimates of current economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where we have a presence, competitor behavior, the mix of product sales, commodity costs, wage rates, the level of manufacturing capacity and the pricing environment.  In addition, estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the market-participant-derived weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.  As a result of impairment testing, we recorded goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments of $6 million during 2016. The office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, we may not always be successful.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products.  While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical factors for both industries include:  price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders and facility managers.  Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group, Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation and Knoll, Inc.  Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Travis Industries Inc., Innovative Hearth Products, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).  In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can - 11-Table of Contentsbe a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products.Our continued success will depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries.  Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins.  In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures.  The concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of these customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We sell our products through multiple distribution channels.  These distribution channels have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate in the future.  Consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers.  The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products.  As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results or financial condition than the events would have had prior to the consolidation.  In fiscal 2016, the Corporation's five largest customers represented approximately 25 percent of its consolidated sales.  No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Corporation's consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016.The growth in sales of private-label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Private-label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer, but manufactured by another party.  Some of our largest customers have aggressive private-label initiatives to increase their sales of office furniture.  If successful, they may reduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may, in some cases, force us to lower prices, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.Increases in basic commodity, raw material, component and transportation costs, as well as disruptions to the supply of basic commodities, raw materials and components or transportation and shipping challenges, could adversely affect our profitability.Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the commodities, raw materials and components used in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales, profitability and our ability to meet customers' demand.  We source commodities, raw materials and components from domestic and international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality and availability of commodities, raw materials and components, including steel, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future.  Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers.We rely primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver our products to customers.  Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers may cause delays in our shipments and increase the cost to ship our products, which may adversely affect our profitability.  Additionally, we import and export products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports.  Port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, could cause delayed receipt of our products and components.  These delays could cause manufacturing disruptions, increased expense resulting from alternate shipping methods or the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability.- 12-Table of ContentsOur efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace requirements may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of our customers and keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we regularly introduce new products.  Trends include changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance.  The introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  The design and engineering of certain new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  In addition, we may face difficulties introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image and our customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated.  Difficulties or delays introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.We have grown, and may continue to grow, our business through acquisitions and alliances, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.One of our growth strategies is to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions of, and or strategic alliances with, businesses with technologies or products complimenting or augmenting our existing products or distribution or adding new products or distribution to our business.  In the past few years, we acquired OFM, a small office furniture company, and Vermont Castings Group, a hearth stoves and fireplace company.  The benefits of these acquisitions, or future acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee any completed or future acquisitions or alliances will in fact produce any benefits.  In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including, without limitation:•diversion of management’s attention, including significant management time devoted to integrating acquisitions;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our financial results.Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions.  These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time.  In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any transactions with acceptable terms in the future.  If an acquisition is completed, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or achieve sales and profitability justifying our investment in the businesses.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Our continuing activities to reduce structural costs may result in customer disruption and may distract management from other activities.As part of our commitment to taking structural cost out of our business, we regularly close, reconfigure or transform manufacturing and distribution facilities.  Over the past several years, we have closed a number of facilities in the United States and internationally.  We have implemented, and will continue to implement, restructuring actions to transform our business and reduce our manufacturing footprint. These actions may take longer than anticipated, prove costlier than expected and may distract management from other activities.  If we do not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring activities, our financial condition and ability to meet customer needs could be negatively affected.- 13-Table of ContentsWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities.The past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members and are self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases our annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Our inability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of dealers could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers.  We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers.  Some of our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason.  The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Our international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.We manufacture, market, and sell our products in international markets, including in China and India.  We plan to continue to grow internationally.  We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, our increased business in countries outside the United States exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems which impose administrative and legal requirements which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds into certain countries.  If we are unable to provide financial support to our international operations in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.We periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions.Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including, without limitation:•social and political turmoil, official corruption and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•the failure of our compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices;•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and- 14-Table of Contents•Ability to repatriate cash held overseas without paying substantial federal income tax.•Changes to border taxes or other international tax reformsRestrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility may limit our operating and financial flexibility.Our credit facility and other financing arrangements may limit our ability to finance operations, service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interests.  Specifically, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  Our credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants.Our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility.  We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all.Costs related to product defects, including product liability costs, could adversely affect our profitability.We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  We use chemicals and materials in our products and include components in our products from external suppliers, which we believe are safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known which could subject us to litigation, including health-related litigation, and significant losses.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances indicating the need for such reserves.  We cannot, however, be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future.  We also purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions, but we cannot be certain insurance would cover all losses related to product claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including our need for capital improvements, tooling, new product development and acquisitions.  To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets.  Our ability to generate cash depends on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms unfavorable to us.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.  If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.Our sales to the U.S. government have declined in recent years and our sales to the U.S. state and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state and local government agencies and departments.  Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which have recently experienced downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty.  Sales to federal government entities decreased by less than 1 percent in 2016 after decreasing 8 percent in the prior year and may decline going forward, which could adversely impact our operating results.Our contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination - 15-Table of Contentsarising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records and reporting of costs.  If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state or local government contracting.Changes in governmental regulation and enforcement priorities may significantly increase our operating costs.Laws and regulations are subject to change and differing interpretations, including in the areas of antitrust and competition, foreign corrupt practices, government contracting, securities and public company reporting, labor and employment practices, data protection, fraud and abuse and tax reporting. Changes in the political climate or in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations or changes in enforcement priorities or activity could adversely affect us by, among other things:•increasing our administrative, compliance, and other costs; •increasing our tax obligations, including unfavorable outcomes from audits performed by various tax authorities; •affecting cash management practices and repatriation efforts; •forcing us to alter or restructure our relationships with dealers and customers; and•requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systemsCompliance with regulations is costly and time-consuming, and we may encounter difficulties, delays or significant expenses in connection with such compliance. Should we become the target of a regulatory investigation or enforcement action, we could incur significant costs and suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.Our implementation and use of a new business software system, and accompanying transformation of our business processes, could result in problems that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.We are engaged in a multi-year, broad-based program, which we refer to as business systems transformation (""BST""), to implement new integrated software systems to support and streamline our business processes.  In 2016 we implemented BST across several of our smaller operating companies.  We expect full implementation across domestic furniture operations during 2017.  We anticipate implementation of BST will require transformation of business and financial processes to realize the full benefits of the project.  Significant efforts are required to design, test and implement BST, requiring investment of resources, including additional selling, general and administrative and capital expenditures.  There can be no assurance other issues relating to BST implementation will not occur, including compatibility issues, integration challenges and delays, and higher than expected implementation costs.  Additionally, when implemented, BST could function improperly or not deliver the projected benefits, which could significantly disrupt our business, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, generate management and financial reports and otherwise run our business.  Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience problems related to BST. We rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect our business.We rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information as well as to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide information to management.  Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers, suppliers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to natural events and malicious activity.  Though we attempt to detect and prevent these incidents, we may not be successful.  Any disruption of our information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by our systems, could result in legal claims and damages, loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, disrupt operations, result in competitive disadvantage and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  We are also required to comply with certain information technology standards, including standards imposed by credit card providers regarding the storage, processing and transmission of card holder data.  Any failure of our systems to meet these standards could result in our inability to accept certain forms of customer payments or risk of card holder data being breached as described above.- 16-Table of ContentsOur results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.We provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods. This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance. Our guidance may not always be accurate. If, in the future, our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.Iowa law and provisions in our charter documents may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.Our Articles of Incorporation give our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval. The existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued with other rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes. Our classified Board, along with other provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or remove our directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. For example, Section 490.1110 of the Iowa Business Corporation Act prohibits publicly held Iowa corporations to which it applies from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Further, Section 490.1108A of the Iowa Business Corporation Act permits a board of directors, in the context of a takeover proposal, to consider not only the effect of a proposed transaction on shareholders, but also on a corporation’s employees, suppliers, customers, creditors and on the communities in which the corporation operates. These provisions could discourage others from bidding for our shares and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in our stock price that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our stock.We may, in the future, adopt other measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or “poison pill”) that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders. These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by our shareholders.An inability to protect our intellectual property could have a significant impact on our business.We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States. In some parts of the world, we have limited protections, if any, for our intellectual property.  The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us, and patents, copyrights, trademarks or service marks may not be issued on our pending or contemplated applications. In addition, not all of our products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections. It is also possible that our patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed or circumvented.In the past, certain of our products have been copied and sold by others.  We try to enforce our intellectual property rights, but we have to make choices about where and how we pursue enforcement and where we seek and maintain intellectual property protection. In many cases, the cost of enforcing our rights is substantial, and we may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits. - 17-Table of ContentsIf third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.We face the risk of claims that we have infringed upon third parties’ intellectual property rights. Companies operating in our industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of our principal competitors have large patent portfolios. Prior to launching major new products in our key markets, we normally evaluate existing intellectual property rights. However, our competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection which is not, at the time of our evaluation, a matter of public knowledge. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties’ intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand our products or packaging, if feasible; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise the ability to produce or deliver our products.  Several of our production facilities, members and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of our production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect our operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of our business and events including an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers' orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.  We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event"
4,HNI,HNI CORP,2016-02-29,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSThe following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.The existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors, or deterioration of economic conditions, for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition.Office furniture industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.  We experienced softening in the U.S. economy in fiscal 2015 and we expect economic uncertainty to continue into 2016, which could decrease demand for our office furniture products and have adverse effects on our operating results.Hearth products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors as well, including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  Deterioration of the economic conditions or a slowdown in the recovery in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results.  Additionally, the recent decline in oil and other fuel prices has negatively impacted demand for our pellet stoves and we expect demand to remain soft in our pellet business as oil and other fuel prices are projected to remain low.Economic growth has slowed, and may continue to slow, in several key international markets, including China and India, which could have adverse effects on our international office furniture sales and our operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect our business significantly, including:  reduced demand for products; insolvency of our dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations; and counter-party failures negatively impacting our treasury operations.We may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  As of January 2, 2016, we had goodwill of $278 million recorded on our balance sheet.  We test for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year and whenever indicators of impairment exist.  We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment, and accordingly, an impairment is recognized.We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.  Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of longer term, broad market trends.  We combine this trend data with estimates of current economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where we have a presence, competitor behavior, the mix of product sales, commodity costs, wage rates, the level of manufacturing capacity and the pricing environment.  In addition, estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the market-participant-derived weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.  As a result of impairment testing, we recorded goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments of $11 million during 2015. The office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, we may not always be successful.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products.  While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical - 10-Table of Contentsfactors for both industries include:  price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders and facility managers.  Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group, Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation, Virco Mfg. Corporaton, Krueger International Inc. (KI) and Knoll, Inc.  Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Travis Industries Inc., Innovative Hearth Products, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).  In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products.Our continued success will depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries.  Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face significant price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins.  In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures.  The concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of these customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We sell our products through multiple distribution channels.  These distribution channels have been consolidating  and may continue to consolidate in the future.  Consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers, including as a result of the recent mergers and announced mergers of national office product distributors.  The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products.  As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results or financial condition than the events would have had prior to the consolidation.The growth in sales of private-label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Private-label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer, but manufactured by another party.  Some of our largest customers have aggressive private-label initiatives to increase sales of office furniture.  If successful, they may reduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may, in some cases, even force us to lower prices, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.Increases in basic commodity, raw material, component and transportation costs, as well as disruptions to the supply of basic commodities, raw materials and components or transportation and shipping challenges, could adversely affect our profitability.Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the commodities, raw materials and components used by us in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales, profitability and our ability to meet customers' demand.  We source commodities, raw materials and components from domestic and international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality and availability of commodities, raw materials and components, including steel, one of our largest raw material categories, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future.  Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers.We rely primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver our products to customers.  Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers may cause delays in our shipments and increase the cost to ship our products, which may adversely affect our profitability.  Additionally, we import and export products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through several U.S. ports, including ports on the West Coast.  Port-caused delays in the - 11-Table of Contentsshipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, could cause delayed receipt of our products and components.  These delays could cause manufacturing disruptions, increased expense resulting from alternate shipping methods or the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability.Our efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace requirements may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of our customers and keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we regularly introduce new products.  Trends include changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance.  The introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  The design and engineering of certain new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  In addition, we may face difficulties introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image and our customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated.  Difficulties or delays introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.We have grown, and may continue to grow, our business through acquisitions and alliances, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.One of our growth strategies is to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions of, and or strategic alliances with, businesses with technologies or products complimenting or augmenting our existing products or distribution or adding new products or distribution to our business.  In the past few years, we acquired Vermont Castings Group, a hearth stoves and fireplace company, Artcobell, an education furniture company, and BP Ergo, an office furniture company in India, each of which we continue to integrate into our business.  The benefits of these acquisitions, or future acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee any completed or future acquisitions or alliances will in fact produce any benefits.  In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including, without limitation:•diversion of management’s attention, including significant management time devoted to integrating acquisitions;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results.Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions.  These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time.  In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any transactions with acceptable terms in the future.  If an acquisition is completed, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or achieve sales and profitability justifying our investment in the businesses.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Our continuing activities to reduce structural costs and drive consistent, flawless execution may result in customer disruption and may distract management from other activities.As part of our commitment to taking structural cost out of our business, we regularly close, reconfigure or transform manufacturing and distribution facilities.  In the past two years, we have closed several facilities in the United States and internationally.  We - 12-Table of Contentshave implemented, and will continue to implement, restructuring actions to transform our business and reduce our manufacturing footprint. These actions may take longer than anticipated, prove more costly than expected and may distract management from other activities.  If we do not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring activities, our financial condition and ability to meet customer needs could be negatively affected.We are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities.The past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members and are self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases our annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Our inability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of dealers could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers.  We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers.  Many of our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason.  The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Our international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.We manufacture, market, and sell our products in international operations and sales, including in China and India.  We plan to continue to grow internationally.  We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, our increased business in countries outside the United States exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent weakening of the Rupee in India and the Canadian Dollar.  Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems which impose administrative and legal requirements which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds into certain countries.  If we are unable to provide financial support to our international operations in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.We periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions.Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including, without limitation:•social and political turmoil, official corruption and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;- 13-Table of Contents•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices; and•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.Restrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility and note purchase agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility.Our credit facility and other financing arrangements, including the note purchase agreement related to our senior notes which mature in April 2016, limit our ability to finance operations, service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.  Specifically, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  Our note purchase agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, among other things, placing limits on our ability to incur liens on assets, incur additional debt, transfer or sell our assets, merge or consolidate with other persons or enter into material transactions with affiliates.  Our credit facility and note purchase agreement also require us to maintain certain financial covenants.Our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility.  We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all.Costs related to product defects, including product liability costs, could adversely affect our profitability.We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  We use chemicals and materials in our products and include components in our products from external suppliers, which we believe are safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known which could subject us to litigation, including health-related litigation, and significant losses.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances indicating the need for such reserves.  We cannot, however, be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future.  We also purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions, but we cannot be certain insurance would cover all losses related to product claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including capital improvements, tooling, new product development and acquisitions.  To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets.  Our ability to generate cash depends on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms unfavorable to us.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.  If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.Our sales to the U.S. government have declined in recent years and our sales to the U.S. state and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state and local government agencies and departments.  Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which have recently experienced downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty due to continuing budget cuts.  Sales to  federal - 14-Table of Contentsgovernment entities decreased by 8% in 2015 after being up 10% in the prior year and they may decline going forward, which could adversely impact our operating results.Our contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records and reporting of costs.  If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state or local government contracting.Increased government focus on enforcement may significantly increase our operating costs.The federal government has increased its focus on enforcement under a wide range of laws and regulations impacting our business, particularly in the following areas:•antitrust and competition;•foreign corrupt practices;•government contracting;•securities and public company reporting;•labor and employment practices;•fraud and abuse; and•tax reporting.Should we become the target of a government investigation or enforcement action, we could incur significant costs and suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.Our implementation and use of a new business software system, and accompanying transformation of our business processes, could result in problems that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.We are engaged in a multi-year, broad-based program, which we refer to as business systems transformation (""BST""),  to implement new integrated software systems to support and streamline our business processes.  We expect implementation of BST will require transformation of business and financial processes to realize the full benefits of the project.  Significant efforts are required to design, test and implement BST, requiring investment of resources, including additional selling, general and administrative and capital expenditures.  There can be no assurance other issues relating to BST implementation will not occur, including compatibility issues, integration challenges and delays, and higher than expected implementation costs.  Additionally, when implemented, BST could function improperly or not deliver the projected benefits, which could significantly disrupt our business, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, generate management and financial reports and otherwise run our business.  Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience problems related to BST.  We rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide information to management.  Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches, hackers and employee misuse. We may face unauthorized attempts by hackers seeking to harm us or as a result of industrial espionage to penetrate our network security and gain access to our network, steal intellectual or other proprietary data, including design, sales or personally identifiable information, introduce malicious software or interrupt our internal systems, manufacturing or distribution.  Though we attempt to prevent and detect these incidents, we may not be successful.  Any disruption of our information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by our - 15-Table of Contentssystems, could result in legal claims and damages, loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, disrupt operations, result in competitive disadvantage and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  We are also required to comply with certain information technology standards, including standards imposed by credit card providers regarding the storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data.  These standards continue to become more challenging to meet, and any failure of our systems to meet these standards could result in our inability to accept certain forms of customer payments or risk of cardholder data being breached as described above.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise the ability to produce or deliver our products.  Several of our production facilities, members and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of our production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect our operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of our business and events including an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers' orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.  We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event.Our business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Other miscellaneous risks include, without limitation:•reduced demand for our storage products caused by changes in office technology, including the change from paper record storage to electronic record storage;•our ability to realize cost savings and productivity improvements from our cost containment, business simplification, manufacturing consolidation and logistical realignment initiatives;•volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities may adversely affect the market price for our common stock;•our ability to protect our intellectual property, including trade secrets and key business operations data;•labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to items including new product introductions, a new operating system or turnover in personnel;•our ability to effectively manage working capital and maintain our effective tax rate;•potential claims by third parties that we infringed upon their intellectual property rights;•our insurance may not adequately (1) insulate us from expenses for product defects and the negligent acts and omissions of our members and agents and (2) compensate us for damages to our facilities and equipment and loss of business; and•our ability to retain our experienced management team and recruit other key personnel"
8,HNI,HNI CORP,2015-02-27,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSThe following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.The existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors, or deterioration of economic conditions, for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition.Office furniture industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.  Despite economic recovery in the United States, generally, economic conditions remain uncertain.  Service-sector employment has rebounded slowly and may not return to pre-recession levels, which could decrease demand for our office furniture products and have adverse effects on our operating results.Hearth products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors as well, including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  Deterioration of the economic conditions or a slowdown in the recovery in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results.Economic growth has slowed, and may continue to slow, in several key international markets, including China and India, which could have adverse effects on our international office furniture sales and our operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect our business significantly, including:  reduced demand for products; insolvency of our dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations; and counter-party failures negatively impacting our treasury operations.We may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  As of January 3, 2015, we had goodwill of $279 million recorded on our balance sheet.  We test for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year and whenever indicators of impairment exist.  We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment, and accordingly, an impairment is recognized.We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.  Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of longer term, broad market trends.  We combine this trend data with estimates of current economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where we have a presence, competitor behavior, the mix of product sales, commodity costs, wage rates, the level of manufacturing capacity and the pricing environment.  In addition, estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the market-participant-derived weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.  As a result of impairment testing, we recorded goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments of $29 million during 2014.  We have one recently acquired reporting unit within the office furniture segment where the fair value exceeds the carrying value by two percent.  There is approximately $3 million of total goodwill associated with this reporting unit.The office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, we may not always be successful.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products.  While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical factors for both industries include:  price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders and - 10-Table of Contentsfacility managers.  Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group, Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation, Virco Mfg. Corporaton, Krueger International Inc. (KI) and Knoll, Inc.  Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Travis Industries Inc., Comvest Partners (Innovative Hearth Products), Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).  In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products.Our continued success will depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries.  Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face significant price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins.  In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures.  The concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of these customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We sell our products through multiple distribution channels.  These distribution channels have been consolidating  and may continue to consolidate in the future.  Consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers, including as a result of the recent mergers and announced mergers of national office product distributors.  The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products.  As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results or financial condition than the events would have had prior to the consolidation.The growth in sales of private-label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Private-label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer, but manufactured by another party.  Some of our largest customers have aggressive private-label initiatives to increase sales of office furniture.  If successful, they may reduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may, in some cases, even force us to lower prices, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.Increases in basic commodity, raw material, component and transportation costs, as well as disruptions to the supply of basic commodities, raw materials and components or transportation and shipping challenges, could adversely affect our profitability.Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the commodities, raw materials and components used by us in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales, profitability and our ability to meet customers' demand.  We source commodities, raw materials and components from domestic and international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality and availability of commodities, raw materials and components, including steel, our largest raw material category, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future.  Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers.We rely primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver our products to customers.  Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers may cause delays in our shipments and increase the cost to ship our products, which may adversely affect our profitability.  Additionally, we import and export products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through several U.S. ports, including ports on the West Coast.  Port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including related to the current labor dispute at certain West Coast ports, could cause delayed receipt of our products and components.  These delays could cause manufacturing disruptions, increased expense - 11-Table of Contentsresulting from alternate shipping methods or the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability.The cost of energy could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.Our gross margins and the profitability of our business operations are sensitive to the cost of energy because it is reflected in our cost of transportation, petroleum-based materials like plastics and operation of our manufacturing facilities.  If the costs of petroleum-based products, operating our manufacturing facilities or transportation increase, it could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.Our efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace requirements may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of our customers and keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we regularly introduce new products.  Trends include changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance.  The introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  The design and engineering of certain new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  In addition, we may face difficulties introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image and our customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated.  Difficulties or delays introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.We have grown, and may continue to grow, our business through acquisitions and alliances, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.One of our growth strategies is to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions of, and or strategic alliances with, businesses with technologies or products complimenting or augmenting our existing products or distribution or adding new products or distribution to our business.  In the past few years, we acquired Vermont Castings Group, a hearth stoves and fireplace company, Artcobell, an education furniture company, and BP Ergo, an office furniture company in India, each of which we continue to integrate into our business.  The benefits of these acquisitions, or future acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee any completed or future acquisitions or alliances will in fact produce any benefits.  In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including, without limitation:•diversion of management’s attention, including significant management time devoted to integrating acquisitions;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results.Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions.  These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time.  In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any transactions with acceptable terms in the future.  If an acquisition is completed, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or achieve sales and profitability justifying our investment in the businesses.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.- 12-Table of ContentsWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities.The past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members and are self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases our annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Our inability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of dealers could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers.  We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers.  Many of our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason.  The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Our international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.During the past several years, we have experienced growth in our international operations and sales, including in China and India.  We plan to continue to grow internationally.  We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, our increased business in countries outside the United States exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the recent weakening of the Rupee in India and the Canadian Dollar.  Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems which impose administrative and legal requirements which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds into certain countries.  If we are unable to provide financial support to our international operations in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.We periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions.Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including, without limitation:•social and political turmoil, official corruption and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices; and•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.- 13-Table of ContentsRestrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility and note purchase agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility.Our credit facility and note purchase agreement, dated as of April 6, 2006, pursuant to which we issued $150 million of senior, unsecured notes designated as Series 2006-A Senior Notes, limit our ability to finance operations, service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.  Specifically, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  Our note purchase agreement contains customary restrictive covenants, among other things, placing limits on our ability to incur liens on assets, incur additional debt, transfer or sell our assets, merge or consolidate with other persons or enter into material transactions with affiliates.  Our credit facility and note purchase agreement also require us to maintain certain financial covenants.Our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility and could result in a cross default under our note purchase agreement.  We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all.Costs related to product defects, including product liability costs, could adversely affect our profitability.We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  We use chemicals and materials in our products and include components in our products from external suppliers, which we believe are safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known which could subject us to litigation, including health-related litigation, and significant losses.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances indicating the need for such reserves.  We cannot, however, be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future.  We also purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions, but we cannot be certain insurance would cover all losses related to product claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including capital improvements, tooling, new product development and acquisitions.  To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets.  Our ability to generate cash depends on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms unfavorable to us.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.  If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.Our sales to the U.S. government have declined in recent years and our sales to the U.S. state and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state and local government agencies and departments.  Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which have recently experienced downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty due to continuing budget cuts.  Although sales to the federal government increased by 10% in 2014, after falling 28% and 26% in fiscal years 2013 and 2012, respectively, they may decline going forward, which could adversely impact our operating results.Our contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government as well as state and local governments can typically terminate or modify their contracts - 14-Table of Contentswith us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records and reporting of costs.  If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state or local government contracting.Increased government focus on enforcement may significantly increase our operating costs.The federal government has increased its focus on enforcement under a wide range of laws and regulations impacting our business, particularly in the following areas:•antitrust and competition;•foreign corrupt practices;•government contracting;•securities and public company reporting;•labor and employment practices;•fraud and abuse; and•tax reporting.Should we become the target of a government investigation or enforcement action, we could incur significant costs and suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.Our implementation and use of a new business software system, and accompanying transformation of our business processes, could result in problems that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.We are engaged in a multi-year, company-wide program to implement new integrated software systems (the ""System"") to support and streamline our business processes.  We expect implementation of the System will require transformation of business and financial processes to realize the full benefits of the project.  Significant efforts are required to design, test and implement the System, requiring investment of resources, including additional selling, general and administrative and capital expenditures.  There can be no assurance other issues relating to System implementation will not occur, including compatibility issues, integration challenges and delays, and higher than expected implementation costs.  Additionally, when implemented, the System could function improperly or not deliver the projected benefits, which could significantly disrupt our business, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, generate management and financial reports and otherwise run our business.  Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience problems related to the System.  We rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide information to management.  Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches, hackers and employee misuse. We may face unauthorized attempts by hackers seeking to harm us or as a result of industrial espionage to penetrate our network security and gain access to our network, steal intellectual or other proprietary data, including design, sales or personally identifiable information, introduce malicious software or interrupt our internal systems, manufacturing or distribution.  Though we attempt to prevent and detect these incidents, we may not be successful.  Any disruption of our information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by our systems, could result in legal claims and damages, loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, disrupt operations, result in competitive disadvantage and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  We are also required to comply with certain information technology standards, including standards imposed by credit card providers regarding the storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data.  These standards continue - 15-Table of Contentsto become more challenging to meet, and any failure of our systems to meet these standards could result in our inability to accept certain forms of customer payments or risk of cardholder data being breached as described above.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise the ability to produce or deliver our products.  Several of our production facilities, members and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of our production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect our operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of our business and events including an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers' orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.  We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event.Our business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Other miscellaneous risks include, without limitation:•reduced demand for our storage products caused by changes in office technology, including the change from paper record storage to electronic record storage;•our ability to realize cost savings and productivity improvements from our cost containment, business simplification, manufacturing consolidation and logistical realignment initiatives;•volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities may adversely affect the market price for our common stock;•our ability to protect our intellectual property, including trade secrets and key business operations data;•labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to items including new product introductions, a new operating system or turnover in personnel;•our ability to effectively manage working capital and maintain our effective tax rate;•potential claims by third parties that we infringed upon their intellectual property rights;•our insurance may not adequately (1) insulate us from expenses for product defects and the negligent acts and omissions of our members and agents and (2) compensate us for damages to our facilities and equipment and loss of business; and•our ability to retain our experienced management team and recruit other key personnel"

Industry factors, such as corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.  Despite economic recovery in the United States, generally, economic conditions remain uncertain.  Employment has rebounded slowly and may not return to pre-recession level, which could decrease demand for our office furniture products and have adverse effects on our operating results.Hearth products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors as well, including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  Deterioration of the economic conditions or a slowdown in the recovery in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results.Economic growth has slowed, and may continue to slow, in several key international markets, including China and India, which could have adverse effects on our international office furniture sales and our operating results.Deteriorating economic conditions could affect our business significantly, including:  reduced demand for products; insolvency of our dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations; and counter-party failures negatively impacting our treasury operations.Uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal government, including the shutdown during fiscal 2013 and continued spending cuts, make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which - 10-Table of Contentscould cause us to incur excess costs.  Additionally, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, labor or materials used in our products that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share.We may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  As of December 28, 2013, we had goodwill of $287 million recorded on our balance sheet.  We test for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year and whenever indicators of impairment exist.  We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment, and accordingly, such impairment is recognized.We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.  Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of longer term, broad market trends.  We combine this trend data with estimates of current economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where we have a presence, competitor behavior, the mix of product sales, commodity costs, wage rates, the level of manufacturing capacity and the pricing environment.  In addition, estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the market-participant-derived weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.  We have two recently acquired reporting units within the office furniture segment where the fair value exceeds the carrying value by seven percent and six percent.  There is approximately $26 million of total goodwill associated with these two reporting units.The office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, we may not always be successful.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products.  While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical factors for both industries include:  price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, such as architects, designers, home-builders and facility managers.  Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group, Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation, Virco Mfg.

(KI) and Knoll, Inc.  Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Travis Industries Inc., Comvest Partners (Innovative Hearth Products), Vermont Castings Group, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).  In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products.Our continued success will depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries.  Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face significant price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins.  In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures.  The concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of such customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We sell our products through multiple distribution channels.  These distribution channels have been consolidating  and may continue to consolidate in the future.  Consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers, including as a result of the recent merger of Office Depot, Inc. and OfficeMax Incorporated.  The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products.  As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results or financial condition than such events would have had prior to the consolidation.- 11-Table of ContentsThe growth in sales of private-label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Private-label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer, but manufactured by another party.  Some of our largest customers have aggressive private-label initiatives to increase sales of office furniture.  If successful, they may reduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may, in some cases, even force us to lower prices, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.Increases in basic commodity, raw material and component costs, as well as disruptions to the supply of basic commodities, raw materials and components, could adversely affect our profitability.Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the commodities, raw materials and components used by us in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales, profitability and our ability to meet customers' demand.  We source commodities, raw materials and components from domestic and international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality and availability of commodities, raw materials and components, including steel, our largest raw material category, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future.  Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers.The cost of energy could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.Our gross margins and the profitability of our business operations are sensitive to the cost of energy because it is reflected in our cost of transportation, petroleum-based materials like plastics and operation of our manufacturing facilities.  If the costs of petroleum-based products, operating our manufacturing facilities or transportation increase, it could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.Our efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace requirements may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline.To meet the changing needs of our customers and keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we periodically introduce new products.  Trends include changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance.  The introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of such products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  The design and engineering of certain new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  In addition, we may face difficulties introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image and our customers' needs.  Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated.  Difficulties or delays introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.We have grown, and may continue to grow, our business through acquisitions and alliances, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.One of our growth strategies is to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions of, and or strategic alliances with, businesses with technologies or products complimenting or augmenting our existing products or distribution or adding new products or distribution to our business.  In the past three years, we acquired Artcobell, an education furniture company, and BP Ergo, an office furniture company in India, both of which we continue to integrate into our business.  The benefits of these acquisitions, or future acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee any completed or future acquisitions or alliances will in fact produce any benefits.  In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including, without limitation:•diversion of management’s attention, including significant management time devoted to integrating acquisitions;- 12-Table of Contents•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results.Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete such acquisitions.  These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time.  In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any transactions with acceptable terms in the future.  If an acquisition is completed, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or achieve sales and profitability justifying our investment in such businesses.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities.The past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members and are self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases our annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Our inability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of dealers could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers.  We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers.  Our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason.  The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Our international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.During the past several years, we have experienced growth in our international operations and sales, including in China and India.  We plan to continue to grow internationally.  We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, our increased business in countries outside the United States exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the recent weakening of the Rupee in India.  Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.- 13-Table of ContentsFurther, certain countries have complex regulatory systems which impose administrative and legal requirements which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds into certain countries.  If we are unable to provide financial support to our international operations in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.We periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions.Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including, without limitation:•social and political turmoil, official corruption and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, such as the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices; and•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.Restrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility and note purchase agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility.Our credit facility and note purchase agreement, dated as of April 6, 2006, pursuant to which we issued $150 million of senior, unsecured notes designated as Series 2006-A Senior Notes, limit our ability to finance operations, service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.  Specifically, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  Our note purchase agreement contains customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, place limits on our ability to incur liens on assets, incur additional debt, transfer or sell our assets, merge or consolidate with other persons or enter into material transactions with affiliates.  Our credit facility and note purchase agreement also require us to maintain certain financial covenants.Our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility and could result in a cross default under our note purchase agreement.  We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all.Costs related to product defects, including product liability costs, could adversely affect our profitability.We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  We use chemicals and materials in our products and include components in our products from external suppliers, which we believe are safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known which could subject us to litigation, including health-related litigation, and significant losses.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances indicating the need for such reserves.  We cannot, however, be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future.  We also purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions, but we cannot be certain insurance would cover all losses related to product claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including capital improvements, tooling, new product development and acquisitions.  To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets.  Our ability to generate cash depends on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs.- 14-Table of ContentsAny equity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms unfavorable to us.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock.  If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.Our sales to the U.S. government are declining and our sales to the U.S. state and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.We derive a portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state and local government agencies and departments.  Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which have recently experienced downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty due to continuing budget cuts.  In fiscal years 2013 and 2012, our sales to the U.S. government have decreased 28% and 26%, respectively, and may continue to decline going forward, which could adversely impact our operating results.Our contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government as well as state and local governments can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records and reporting of costs.  If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state or local government contracting.Increased government focus on enforcement may significantly increase our operating costs.The federal government has increased its focus on enforcement under a wide range of laws and regulations impacting our business, particularly in the following areas:•antitrust and competition;•foreign corrupt practices;•government contracting;•securities and public company reporting;•labor and employment practices;•fraud and abuse; and•tax reporting.Should we become the target of a government investigation or enforcement action, we could incur significant costs and suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.Our implementation and use of a new business software system, and accompanying transformation of our business processes, could result in problems that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.We are engaged in a multi-year, company-wide program to implement new integrated software systems (the ""System"") to support and streamline our business processes.  We expect implementation of the System will require transformation of business and financial processes to realize the full benefits of the project.  Significant efforts are required to design, test and implement the System, requiring investment of resources, including additional selling, general and administrative and capital expenditures.  There can be no assurance other issues relating to System implementation will not occur, including compatibility issues, integration challenges and delays, and higher than expected implementation costs.  Additionally, when implemented, the System could function improperly or not deliver the projected benefits, which could significantly disrupt our business, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, generate management and financial reports and otherwise run our business.  Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience problems related to the System.  - 15-Table of ContentsWe rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide information to management.  Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches, hackers and employee misuse. We may face unauthorized attempts by hackers seeking to harm us or as a result of industrial espionage to penetrate our network security and gain access to our network, steal proprietary data, including design, sales or personally identifiable information, introduce malicious software or interrupt our internal systems, manufacturing or distribution.  Though we attempt to prevent and detect these incidents, we may not be successful.  Any disruption of our information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by our systems, could result in legal claims and damages, disrupt operations, result in competitive disadvantage and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise the ability to produce or deliver our products.  Several of our production facilities, members and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of our production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect our operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of our business and events such as an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.  We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event.Our business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Other miscellaneous risks include, without limitation:•reduced demand for our storage products caused by changes in office technology, including the change from paper record storage to electronic record storage;•our ability to realize cost savings and productivity improvements from our cost containment, business simplification, manufacturing consolidation and logistical realignment initiatives;•volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities may adversely affect the market price for our common stock;•our ability to protect our intellectual property, including trade secrets and key business operations data;•labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to items such as new product introductions, a new operating system or turnover in personnel;•our ability to effectively manage working capital and maintain our effective tax rate;•potential claims by third parties that we infringed upon their intellectual property rights;- 16-Table of Contents•our insurance may not adequately (1) insulate us from expenses for product defects and the negligent acts and omissions of our members and agents and (2) compensate us for damages to our facilities and equipment and loss of business; and•our ability to retain our experienced management team and recruit other key personnel"
10,HNI,HNI CORP,2013-02-22,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSThe following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Unfavorable economic and market conditions could reduce our sales and profitability and as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.Over the past few years, economic conditions have been challenging in the U.S. and many of the countries and regions in which we do business.  Despite modest recovery in the U.S. economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging for the foreseeable future.  Economic conditions in the U.S., and in international markets have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on demand for our products.  General business and economic conditions that could affect us include short-term and long-term interest rates, unemployment, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, limited availability of consumer financing and weak credit markets, the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which we operate.There could be a number of effects from these economic developments on our business, including:  reduced demand for products; insolvency of our dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations; and counter-party failures negatively impacting our treasury operations.In addition, the current weak recovery and general uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal government, including the debt ceiling and the so-called ""fiscal cliff"", make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to incur excess costs.  Additionally, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, labor or materials used in our products that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share.-10-Table of ContentsWe may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  As of December 29, 2012, we had goodwill of $288 million recorded on our balance sheet.  We test for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year and whenever indicators of impairment exist.  We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment, and accordingly, such impairment is recognized.We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.  Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of longer term, broad market trends.  We combine this trend data with estimates of current economic conditions in the U.S., competitor behavior, the mix of product sales, commodity costs, wage rates, the level of manufacturing capacity and the pricing environment.  In addition, estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the market-participant-derived weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.  We have two reporting units that have been recently acquired and therefore have a historical cost closer to their current fair value.The office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, we may not always be successful.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products.  While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical factors for both industries include:  price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, such as architects, designers, home-builders and facility managers.  Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group, Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation, Virco Mfg. Corporaton, Krueger International Inc. (KI) and Knoll, Inc.  Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Travis Industries Inc., Comvest Partners (Innovative Hearth Products), Riverside Company (Vermont Castings Group), Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).  In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products.Our continued success will depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries.  Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face significant price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Such price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins.  In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures.  The concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of such customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We sell our products through multiple distribution channels.  These distribution channels have been consolidating in the past several years and may continue to consolidate in the future.  Such consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers.  The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products.  As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results or financial condition than such events would have had prior to such consolidation.-11-Table of

international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality and availability of commodities, raw materials and components, including steel, our largest raw material category, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future.  Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers.We are affected by the cost of energy, and increases in energy prices could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.Our gross margins and the profitability of our business operations are sensitive to the cost of energy because it is reflected in our cost of transportation, petroleum-based materials like plastics and operation of our manufacturing facilities.  If the costs of petroleum-based products, operating our manufacturing facilities or transportation increase, it could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.Our efforts to introduce new products that meet customer and workplace requirements may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline.To keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we must periodically introduce new products.  Such trends include changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance.  The introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of such products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  The design and engineering of certain new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  In addition, we may face difficulties in introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image.  Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated.  Difficulties or delays in introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.-12-Table of ContentsWe have grown, and may continue to grow, our business through acquisitions, alliances and joint venture arrangements, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.One of our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth through acquisitions of, and alliances and joint venture arrangements with, businesses with technologies or products that complement or augment our existing products or distribution or add new products or distribution to our business.  In the past two years, we acquired Sagus International, an education furniture company, and BP Ergo Limited, an office furniture company in India, both of which we continue to integrate into our business.  The benefits of these acquisitions, or future acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee any completed or future acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures will in fact produce any benefits.  In addition, acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures involve a number of risks, including, without limitation:•diversion of management’s attention, including significant management time devoted to integrating acquisitions;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results.Our ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete such acquisitions.  These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time.  In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any such transactions with acceptable terms in the future.  If an acquisition is completed, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or that we will achieve sales and profitability that justify our investment in such businesses.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities.The past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.The existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors such as service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, such as corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.-13-Table of ContentsHearth products industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors as well, including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  Deterioration of the economic conditions or a slowdown in the recovery in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members and are self-insured.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases our annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Our inability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of such dealers could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers.  We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers.  Our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason.  The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Our international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.During the past several years, we have experienced growth in our international operations and sales, including in China and India.  We plan to continue to grow internationally.  We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, our increased business in countries outside the United States exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.Further, certain countries have complex regulatory systems which impose administrative and legal requirements which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds into certain countries.  If we are unable to provide financial support to our international operations in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.We periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions.Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including, without limitation:•social and political turmoil, official corruption and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, such as the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;•infrastructure disruptions;•potentially conflicting cultural and business practices; and•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.-14-Table of ContentsRestrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility and note purchase agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility.Our credit facility and note purchase agreement, dated as of April 6, 2006, pursuant to which we issued $150 million of senior, unsecured notes designated as Series 2006-A Senior Notes, limit our ability to finance operations, service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.  Specifically, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  Our note purchase agreement contains customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, place limits on our ability to incur liens on assets, incur additional debt, transfer or sell our assets, merge or consolidate with other persons or enter into material transactions with affiliates.  Our credit facility and note purchase agreement also require us to maintain certain financial covenants.Our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility and could result in a cross default under our note purchase agreement.  We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all.Costs related to product defects, including product liability costs, could adversely affect our profitability.We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  We use chemicals and materials in our products and include components in our products from external suppliers, which we believe are safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known which could subject us to litigation, including health-related litigation, and significant losses.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances that indicate the need for such reserves.  We cannot, however, be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future.  We also purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions, but we cannot be certain insurance would cover all losses related to product claims.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including capital improvements, tooling, new product development and acquisitions.  To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets.  Our ability to generate cash depends on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms that are not favorable to us.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock.  If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.Our sales to the U.S. government and various state and local governments is subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.We derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state and local government agencies and departments.  Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which have recently experienced downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty due in part to the potential for automatic spending cuts; including those related to the federal debt ceiling and the so-called ""fiscal cliff"".-15-Table of ContentsOur contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government as well as state and local governments can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records and reporting of costs.  If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state or local government contracting.Increased government focus on enforcement may significantly increase our operating costs.The federal government has increased its focus on enforcement under a wide range of laws and regulations impacting our business, particularly in the following areas:•antitrust and competition;•foreign corrupt practices;•government contracting;•securities and public company reporting;•labor and employment practices;•fraud and abuse; and•tax reporting.Should we become the target of a government investigation or enforcement action, we could incur significant costs and suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.Our implementation and use of a new business software system, and accompanying transformation of our business processes, could result in problems that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.We are engaged in a multi-year, company-wide program to implement new integrated software systems (the ""System"") to support and streamline our business processes.  We expect implementation of the System will require transformation of business and financial processes to realize the full benefits of the project.  Significant efforts are required to design, test and implement the System, requiring investment of resources, including additional selling, general and administrative and capital expenditures.  There can be no assurance other issues relating to System implementation will not occur, including compatibility issues, integration challenges and delays, and higher than expected implementation costs.  Additionally, when implemented, the System could function improperly or not deliver the projected benefits, which could significantly disrupt our business, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, generate management and financial reports and otherwise run our business.  Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience problems related to the System.  We rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide information to management.  Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches, hackers and employee misuse. We may face unauthorized attempts by hackers seeking to harm us or as a result of industrial espionage to penetrate our network security and gain access to our network, steal proprietary data, including design, sales or personally identifiable information, introduce malicious software or interrupt our internal systems, manufacturing or distribution.  Though we attempt to prevent and detect these incidents, we may not be successful.  Any disruption of our information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by our systems, could result in legal claims and damages, disrupt operations, result in competitive disadvantage and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.-16-Table of ContentsNatural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise the ability to produce or deliver our products.  Several of our production facilities, members and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and business conditions.  Further, several of our production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect our operations and business conditions.  Members are an integral part of our business and events such as an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.  We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event.Our business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Other miscellaneous risks include, without limitation:•reduced demand for our storage products caused by changes in office technology, including the change from paper record storage to electronic record storage;•our ability to realize cost savings and productivity improvements from our cost containment, business simplification, manufacturing consolidation and logistical realignment initiatives;•volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities may adversely affect the market price for our common stock;•our ability to protect our intellectual property, including trade secrets and key business operations data;•labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to items such as new product introductions, a new operating system or turnover in personnel;•our ability to effectively manage working capital and maintain our effective tax rate;•potential claims by third parties that we infringed upon their intellectual property rights;•our insurance may not adequately (1) insulate us from expenses for product defects and the negligent acts and omissions of our members and agents and (2) compensate us for damages to our facilities and equipment and loss of business; and•our ability to retain our experienced management team and recruit other key personnel"
5,HNI,HNI CORP,2012-02-24,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSThe following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Unfavorable economic and market conditions could reduce our sales and profitability and as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected.Over the past few years, economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in the U.S. and many of the countries and regions in which we do business, and, despite the beginning of the recovery in the U.S. and elsewhere, remain challenging for the foreseeable future.  The recent downturns in the U.S. economy and in international markets have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on demand for our products.  General business and economic conditions that could affect us include short-term and long-term interest rates, unemployment, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, limited availability of consumer financing and weak credit markets, the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which we operate.There could be a number of effects from these economic developments on our business, including:  reduced demand for products; insolvency of our dealers, resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; decreased customer demand, including order -10-Table of Contentsdelays or cancellations; and counter-party failures negatively impacting our treasury operations.In addition, the current weak recovery and general uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to incur excess costs.  Additionally, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, labor or materials used in our products that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share.We may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations.Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  We test for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year and whenever indicators of impairment exist.  We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment, and accordingly, such impairment is recognized.We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.  Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of longer term, broad market trends.  We combine this trend data with estimates of current economic conditions in the U.S., competitor behavior, the mix of product sales, commodity costs, wage rates, the level of manufacturing capacity and the pricing environment.  In addition, estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the market-participant-derived weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We operate in a highly competitive environment and, as a result, we may not always be successful.Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products.  While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical factors for both industries include:  price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, such as architects, designers, home-builders and facility managers.  Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group, Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation, Virco Mfg. Corporaton, KI and Knoll, Inc.  Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Travis Industries Inc., Lennox International Inc., Monessen Hearth Systems Co., FMI Products, LLC, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).  In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products.Our continued success will depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries.  Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face significant price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Such price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins.  In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures.  The concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of such customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We sell our products through multiple distribution channels.  These distribution channels have been consolidating in the past several years and may continue to consolidate in the future.  Such consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers.  The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products.  As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results or financial condition than such events would have had prior to such consolidation.-11-Table of ContentsThe growth in sales of private-label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Private-label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer, but manufactured by another party.  Some of our largest customers have aggressive private-label initiatives to increase sales of office furniture.  If successful, they may reduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may, in some cases, even force us to lower prices, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.Increases in basic commodity, raw material and component costs, as well as disruptions to the supply of such basic commodities, raw materials and components, could adversely affect our profitability.Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the commodities, raw materials and components used by us in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales, profitability and our ability to meet customers' demand.  We source commodities, raw materials and components from low-cost, international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality and availability of commodities, raw materials and components, including steel, our largest raw material category, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future.  Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers.We are affected by the cost of energy, and increases in energy prices could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.Our gross margins and the profitability of our business operations are sensitive to the cost of energy because it is reflected in our cost of transportation, petroleum-based materials like plastics and operation of our manufacturing facilities.  If the costs of petroleum-based products, operating our manufacturing facilities or transportation increase, it could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability.We may not be successful in implementing and managing the risks inherent in our growth strategy.As a part of our growth strategy, we seek to increase sales and market share by introducing new products, further enhancing our existing line of products and continuing to pursue complementary acquisitions.  This strategy depends on our ability to increase sales through our existing customer network, principally dealers, wholesalers and retailers.  Furthermore, the ability to effectuate and manage profitable growth will depend on our ability to contain costs, including costs associated with increased manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts, freight utilization, warehouse capacity, product development and acquisition efforts.Our efforts to introduce new products that meet customer and workplace/home requirements may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline.To keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we must periodically introduce new products.  Such trends include changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance.  The introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of such products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  The design and engineering of certain of our new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  In addition, we may face difficulties in introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image.  Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated.  Difficulties or delays in introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.We intend to grow our business through additional acquisitions, alliances and joint venture arrangements, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.One of our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth through acquisitions of, and alliances and joint venture arrangements with, businesses with technologies or products that complement or augment our existing products or distribution or -12-Table of Contentsadd new products or distribution to our business.  The benefits of an acquisition, alliance or joint venture may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee any completed or future acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures will in fact produce any benefits.  In addition, acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures involve a number of risks, including, without limitation:•diversion of management’s attention;•difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;•reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results.Our ability to grow through acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete such acquisitions.  These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time.  In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any such transactions with acceptable terms in the future.  If an acquisition is completed, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or that we will achieve sales and profitability that justify our investment in such businesses.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.We are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities.The past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.The existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors such as service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, such as corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.Hearth products industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors as well, including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  The U.S. homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an unprecedented downturn, the duration and ultimate severity of which are still uncertain.  Further deterioration of the economic conditions in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could further decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results.Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time and could -13-Table of Contentsadversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Our inability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of such dealers could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers.  We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers.  Our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason.  The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Our international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, we have increasingly been conducting business in countries outside the United States, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.We periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions.Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including, without limitation:•social and political turmoil, official corruption and civil and labor unrest;•restrictive government actions, such as the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;•the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations;•preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•less effective protection of intellectual property;•unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region; and•difficulty in obtaining distribution and support.Restrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility and note purchase agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility.Our credit facility and note purchase agreement, dated as of April 6, 2006, pursuant to which we issued $150 million of senior, unsecured notes designated as Series 2006-A Senior Notes, limit our ability to finance operations, service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.  Specifically, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  Our note purchase agreement contains customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, place limits on our ability to incur liens on assets, incur additional debt, transfer or sell our assets, merge or consolidate with other persons or enter into material transactions with affiliates.  Our credit facility and note purchase agreement also require us to maintain certain financial covenants.Our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility and could result in a cross default under our note purchase agreement.  We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all.Costs related to product defects, including product liability costs, could adversely affect our profitability.We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances that indicate the need for such reserves.  We cannot, however, be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future.  We also purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions.  Incorrect estimates or any -14-Table of Contentssignificant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including capital improvements, tooling, new product development and acquisitions.  To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets.  Our ability to generate cash depends on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs.Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms that are not favorable to us.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock.  If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.Our relationship with the U.S. government and various state and local governments is subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state and local procurement laws and is governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.We derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state and local government agencies and departments.  Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government.Our contracts with these government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government as well as state and local governments can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records and reporting of costs.  If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state or local government contracting.Changes in government regulation and increased focus on enforcement may significantly increase our operating costs.The federal government has a broad agenda of potential legislative and regulatory changes, which if enacted, could significantly impact our profitability by imposing on us additional costs that most likely could not be recovered by increased pricing.  These changes include, without limitation, proposed legislation or pending regulations relating to:•universal healthcare and healthcare reform;•increasing our effective tax rate;•union organizing activities; •energy costs in manufacturing; and •carbon dioxide and particulate emissions.In addition, the federal government has increased its focus on enforcement under a wide range of laws and regulations impacting our business, particularly in the following areas:•antitrust and competition;•foreign corrupt practices;•government contracting;•securities and public company reporting;•labor and employment practices;•fraud and abuse; and•tax reporting.Should we become the target of a government investigation or enforcement action, we could incur significant costs and suffer -15-Table of Contentsdamage to our reputation which could adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.Our implementation and use of a new business software system, and accompanying transformation of our business processes, could result in problems that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.We recently began a multi-year, company-wide program to implement new integrated software systems (the System) to support and streamline our business processes.  We expect implementation of the System will require transformation of business and financial processes to realize the full benefits of the project.  Significant efforts are required to design, test and implement the System, requiring investment of resources, including additional selling, general and administrative and capital expenditures.  There can be no assurance other issues relating to System implementation will not occur, including compatibility issues, integration challenges and delays, and higher than expected implementation costs.  Additionally, when implemented, the System could function improperly or not deliver the projected benefits, which could significantly disrupt our business, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, generate management and financial reports and otherwise run our business.  Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience problems related to the System.  We rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide information to management.  Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches, hackers and employee misuse. Any disruption of our information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by our systems, could result in legal claims and damages, disrupt operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise the ability to produce or deliver our products.  Members are an integral part of our business and events such as an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis and could adversely affect  relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.  We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event.Our business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.Other miscellaneous risks include, without limitation:•reduced demand for our storage products caused by changes in office technology, including the change from paper record storage to electronic record storage;•our ability to realize cost savings and productivity improvements from our cost containment, business simplification, manufacturing consolidation and logistical realignment initiatives;•volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities may adversely affect the market price for our common stock;-16-Table of Contents•changes in labor laws and regulations may affect our ability to hire, retain or dismiss members and the cost and structure of our corporate compliance practices;•changes in securities laws, SEC rules or NYSE listing standards may increase governmental and non-governmental organization oversight of our business, dictate changes in some of our corporate governance, securities disclosure and corporate compliance practices and cause our legal and financial accounting costs to increase;•our ability to protect our intellectual property, including trade secrets and key business operations data;•labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to items such as new product introductions, a new operating system or turnover in personnel;•our ability to effectively manage working capital and maintain our effective tax rate;•future impairment of assets such as facilities or equipment;•potential claims by third parties that we infringed upon their intellectual property rights;•our ability to realize financial benefits from our repurchases of common stock;•executive fraud and misconduct;•our insurance may not adequately (1) insulate us from expenses for product defects and the negligent acts and omissions of our members and agents and (2) compensate us for damages to our facilities and equipment and loss of business; and•our ability to retain our experienced management team and recruit other key personnel"
1,HNI,HNI CORP,2011-02-25,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS The following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Unfavorable economic and market conditions could reduce our sales and profitability and as a result, our operating results may be adversely affected. Over the past few years, economic conditions have deteriorated significantly in the U.S. and many of the countries and regions in which we do business, and, despite the beginning of the recovery in the U.S. and elsewhere, remain challenging for the foreseeable future.  The recent downturns in the U.S. economy and in international markets have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on demand for our products.  General business and economic conditions that could affect us include short-term and long-term interest rates, unemployment, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, limited availability of consumer financing and weak credit markets, the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which we operate. There could be a number of effects from these economic developments on our business, including:  reduced demand for products; insolvency of our dealers, resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations; and counter-party failures negatively impacting our treasury operations. In addition, the current weak recovery and general uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. make it increasingly difficult for us, our customers and our suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause us to incur excess costs.  Additionally, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of products, labor or materials used in our products that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for our products and a loss of market share.-10-Table of Contents We may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible an impairment may exist.  We test for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year and whenever indicators of impairment exist.  We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit.  If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with the reporting unit.  If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, such excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment, and accordingly, such impairment is recognized. We estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.  Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of longer term, broad market trends.  We combine this trend data with estimates of current economic conditions in the U.S., competitor behavior, the mix of product sales, commodity costs, wage rates, the level of manufacturing capacity and the pricing environment.  In addition, estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the market-participant-derived weighted average cost of capital.  Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We operate in a highly competitive environment and, as a result, we may not always be successful. Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products.  While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical factors for both industries include:  price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, such as architects, designers, home-builders and facility managers.  Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group, Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation, KI and Knoll, Inc.  Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Travis Industries Inc., Lennox International Inc., Monessen Hearth Systems Co., FMI Products, LLC, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency).  In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders.  These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products. Our continued success will depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries.  Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets. In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face significant price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries.  Such price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins.  In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures.   The concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of such customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We sell our products through multiple distribution channels.  These distribution channels have been consolidating in the past several years and may continue to consolidate in the future.  Such consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers.  The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products.  As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results or financial condition than such events would have had prior to such consolidation. The growth in sales of private-label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Private-label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer, but manufactured by another party.  Some of our largest customers have aggressive private-label initiatives to increase sales of office furniture.  If successful, they may -11-Table of Contentsreduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may, in some cases, even force us to lower prices, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Increases in basic commodity, raw material and component costs, as well as disruptions to the supply of such basic commodities, raw materials and components, could adversely affect our profitability. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the commodities, raw materials and components used by us in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales, profitability and our ability to meet customers' demand.  We source commodities, raw materials and components from low-cost, international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products.  From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality and availability of commodities, raw materials and components, including steel, our largest raw material category, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and political unrest or instability.  These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future.  Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers. We are affected by the cost of energy, and increases in energy prices could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability. Our gross margins and the profitability of our business operations are sensitive to the cost of energy because it is reflected in our cost of transportation, petroleum-based materials like plastics and operation of our manufacturing facilities.  If the costs of petroleum-based products, operating our manufacturing facilities or transportation increase, it could adversely affect our gross margins and profitability. <div style=""line-height:120%;text-align:justify;font-size:10pt;"">We may not be successful in implementing and managing the risks inherent in our growth strategy. As a part of our growth strategy, we seek to increase sales and market share by introducing new products, further enhancing our existing line of products and continuing to pursue complementary acquisitions.  This strategy depends on our ability to increase sales through our existing customer network, principally dealers, wholesalers and retailers.  Furthermore, the ability to effectuate and manage profitable growth will depend on our ability to contain costs, including costs associated with increased manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts, freight utilization, warehouse capacity, product development and acquisition efforts. Our efforts to introduce new products that meet customer and workplace/home requirements may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline. To keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we must periodically introduce new products.  Such trends include changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance.  The introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of such products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  The design and engineering of certain of our new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance.  In addition, we may face difficulties in introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image.  Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated.  Difficulties or delays in introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. We intend to grow our business through additional acquisitions, alliances and joint venture arrangements, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. One of our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth through acquisitions of, and alliances and joint venture arrangements with, businesses with technologies or products that complement or augment our existing products or distribution or add new products or distribution to our business.  The benefits of an acquisition, alliance or joint venture may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee any completed or future acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures will in fact produce any benefits.  In addition, acquisitions, alliances and joint ventures involve a number of risks, including, without limitation: •    diversion of management’s attention;-12-Table of Contents•    difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;•    potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;•    adverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;•    reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;•    inaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and•    incorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results. Our ability to grow through acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete such acquisitions.  These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time.  In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any such transactions with acceptable terms in the future.  If an acquisition is completed, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or that we will achieve sales and profitability that justify our investment in such businesses.  Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities. The past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances.  Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material. The existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors such as service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, commercial construction and office vacancy rates.  Industry factors, such as corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues. Hearth products industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors as well, including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income and changing demographics.  Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues.  The U.S. homebuilding industry is currently experiencing an unprecedented downturn, the duration and ultimate severity of which are still uncertain.  Further deterioration of the economic conditions in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could further decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results. Increasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. We provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members.  Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our inability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of such dealers could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our -13-Table of Contentsproducts to customers.  We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers.  Our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason.  The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Our international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States. We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, we have increasingly been conducting business in countries outside the United States, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits.  In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency.  Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including, without limitation: •    social and political turmoil, official corruption and civil and labor unrest;•    restrictive government actions, such as the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;•    changes in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;•    the need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations;•    preference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;•    less effective protection of intellectual property;•    unfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region; and•    difficulty in obtaining distribution and support. Restrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility and note purchase agreement may limit our operating and financial flexibility. Our credit facility and note purchase agreement, dated as of April 6, 2006, pursuant to which we issued $150 million of senior, unsecured notes designated as Series 2006-A Senior Notes, limit our ability to finance operations, service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.  Specifically, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements.  Our note purchase agreement contains customary restrictive covenants that, among other things, place limits on our ability to incur liens on assets, incur additional debt, transfer or sell our assets, merge or consolidate with other persons or enter into material transactions with affiliates.  Our credit facility and note purchase agreement also require us to maintain certain financial covenants. Our failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility and could result in a cross default under our note purchase agreement.  We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all. Costs related to product defects, including product liability costs, could adversely affect our profitability. We incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs.  These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase.  We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances that indicate the need for such reserves.  We cannot, however, be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future.  We also purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions.  Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations. We may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms. Our capital requirements depend on many factors, including capital improvements, tooling, new product development and acquisitions.  To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to -14-Table of Contentsraise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets.  Our ability to generate cash depends on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control.  Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms that are not favorable to us.  In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our common stock.  If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital. Our relationship with the U.S. government and various state and local governments is subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state and local procurement laws and is governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state and local government agencies and departments.  Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance.  Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government. Our contracts with these government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government.  The U.S. government as well as state and local governments can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract.  A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government.  Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records and reporting of costs.  If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state or local government contracting. Changes in government regulation and increased focus on enforcement may significantly increase our operating costs. The federal government has a broad agenda of potential legislative and regulatory changes, which if enacted, could significantly impact our profitability by imposing on us additional costs that most likely could not be recovered by increased pricing.  These changes include, without limitation, proposed legislation or pending regulations relating to: •    universal healthcare and healthcare reform;•    increasing our effective tax rate;•    union organizing activities; •    energy costs in manufacturing; and •    carbon dioxide and particulate emissions. In addition, the federal government has increased its focus on enforcement under a wide range of laws and regulations impacting our business, particularly in the following areas: •    antitrust and competition;•    foreign corrupt practices;<div style=""line-height:120%;text-align:justify;"">•    government contracting;•    securities and public company reporting;•    labor and employment practices;•    fraud and abuse; and•    tax reporting. Should we become the target of a government investigation or enforcement action, we could incur significant costs and suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition. Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability. Natural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist -15-Table of Contentsattacks, power interruptions and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise the ability to produce or deliver our products.  Members are an integral part of our business and events such as an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work.  In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis and could adversely affect  relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers.  We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event. Our business is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Other miscellaneous risks include, without limitation: •    reduced demand for our storage products caused by changes in office technology, including the change from paper record storage to electronic record storage; •    our ability to realize cost savings and productivity improvements from our cost containment, business simplification, manufacturing consolidation and logistical realignment initiatives; •    volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities may adversely affect the market price for our common stock; •    changes in labor laws and regulations may affect our ability to hire, retain or dismiss members and the cost and structure of our corporate compliance practices; •    changes in securities laws, SEC rules or NYSE listing standards may increase governmental and non-governmental organization oversight of our business, dictate changes in some of our corporate governance, securities disclosure and corporate compliance practices and cause our legal and financial accounting costs to increase; •    our ability to protect our intellectual property, including trade secrets and key business operations data; •    labor or other manufacturing inefficiencies due to items such as new product introductions, a new operating system or turnover in personnel; •    our ability to effectively manage working capital and maintain our effective tax rate; •    future impairment of assets such as facilities or equipment; •    our ability to successfully implement information technology solutions; •    potential claims by third parties that we infringed upon their intellectual property rights;•    our ability to realize financial benefits from our repurchases of common stock;•    executive fraud and misconduct; •    our insurance may not adequately (1) insulate us from expenses for product defects and the negligent acts and omissions of our members and agents and (2) compensate us for damages to our facilities and equipment and loss of business; and •    our ability to retain our experienced management team and recruit other key personnel. "

9,HNI,HNI CORP,2006-02-27,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Thefollowing risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report onForm 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties describedbelow are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties notpresently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may alsoadversely affect our business, operating results, cash flows, and financialcondition. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be materiallyadversely affected. We operate in a highly competitive environment and, as a result, we may not always be successful. Both the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products. While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical factors for both industries include:  price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, such as architects, designers, home-builders and facility managers. Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group (a Canadian company), Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation (a Canadian company), KI and Knoll, Inc. Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Lennox International Inc. and CFM Corporation (a Canadian company). In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders. These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products. Our continued success will depend on many things, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries. Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets. In both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face significant price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants primarily from lower-cost countries. Such price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures. Increased competition from low-cost Asian imports represents one of the most significant threats to our current market share in the office furniture industry. In the hearth products industry, big box retailers, such as Lowes and Home Depot, with whom we currently do not do business, are increasing their penetration into the market. If such market penetration continues, it could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. 11 There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in our various markets in the future. The concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, particularly the top ten customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of such customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. We sell our products through multiple distribution channels. These distribution channels have been consolidating in the past several years and may continue to consolidate in the future. Such consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers. In 2005, our ten largest customers represented approximately 36% of consolidated net sales. The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products. As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results, or financial condition than such events would have had prior to such consolidation. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our relationships with customers if this consolidation continues. The growth in sales of private label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Private label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer, but manufactured by another party. Some of our largest customers have begun an aggressive private label initiative to increase sales of office furniture. If these initiatives are successful, they may reduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may, in some cases, even force us to lower prices, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. Increasesin basic commodity and raw material costs as well as disruptions to the supplyof such basic commodities and raw materials could adversely affect ourprofitability. Fluctuationsin the price, availability, and quality of the raw materials used by us inmanufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales and ourability to meet the demand of customers. The cost of steel, our largest rawmaterial category, and other commodities have significantly increased in recentyears due to, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changesin laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchangerates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, terrorism, and politicalunrest or instability. These factors could lead to further price increases orsupply interruptions in the future. Our profit margins could be adverselyaffected if raw material and commodity costs remain high or escalate further,and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcinginitiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitivemarket dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to ourcustomers. We areaffected by the cost of energy, and increases in energy prices could adverselyaffect our gross margins and profitability. Ourgross margins and the profitability of our business operations are sensitive tothe cost of energy because the cost of energy is reflected in ourtransportation costs, the cost of petroleum-based materials, like plastics, andthe cost of operating our manufacturing facilities. If the price ofpetroleum-based products, the cost of operating our manufacturing facilitiesand our transportation costs continue to increase it could adversely affect ourgross margins and profitability. We may not be successful in implementing and managing the risks inherent in our growth strategy. As a part of our growth strategy, we seek to increase sales and market share by introducing new products, further enhancing our existing line of products, and continuing to pursue complementary acquisitions. This strategy depends on our ability to increase sales through our existing customer network, principally dealers, wholesalers and retailers. Furthermore, the ability to effectuate and manage profitable growth will depend on our ability to contain costs, including costs associated with increased manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts, freight utilization, warehouse capacity, product development, and acquisition efforts. Our efforts to introduce newproducts that meet customer and workplace/home requirements may not besuccessful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline. To keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, such as changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology, and with evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance, we must periodically introduce new products. The introduction of new products in both 12 industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing, and marketing of such products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. The design and engineering of certain of our new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance. In addition, we may face difficulties in introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image. Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than originally anticipated by us. Difficulties or delays in introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline, and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. We intend to grow our business through additional acquisitions, alliances, and joint venture arrangements, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Oneof our growth strategies is to supplement our internal growth throughacquisitions, alliances, and joint venture arrangements of businesses withtechnologies or products that complement or augment our existing products or distributionor add new products or distribution to our business. In January 2006, weannounced the signing of an agreement to purchase Lamex, a privately heldChinese manufacturer and marketer of office furniture. The benefits of anacquisition, alliance, or joint venture may take more time than expected todevelop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that ourLamex acquisition or any future acquisitions, alliances or joint ventures willin fact produce any benefits. In addition, acquisitions, alliances, and jointventures involve a number of risks, including:                   diversion of managements attention;                  difficulties in assimilating the operationsand products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies,cost savings, and revenue synergies;                  potential loss of key employees or customersof the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing businessrelationships with suppliers and customers;                  adverse impact on overall profitability ifacquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in ourvaluation models;                  reallocation of amounts of capital from otheroperating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt servicerequirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turnrestrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursueother important elements of our business strategy;                  inaccurate assessment of undisclosed,contingent, or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associatedwith the acquisition; and                  incorrect estimates made in the accountingfor acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off ofsignificant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our operatingresults. Ourability to grow through acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availabilityof suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability tocompete effectively for these acquisition candidates, and the availability ofcapital to complete such acquisitions. These risks could be heightened if wecomplete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time. Inaddition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue toidentify attractive opportunities or enter into any such transactions withacceptable terms in the future. If an acquisition is completed, there can be noassurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entityinto our operations or that we will achieve sales and profitability thatjustify our investment in such businesses. Any potential acquisition may not besuccessful and could adversely affect our business, operating results, orfinancial condition. We are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities. The past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material affect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws, or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to make additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material. The existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. 13 Office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors such as service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, non-residential fixed investment, and commercial construction. Industry factors, such as corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies, also influence office furniture industry revenues. Hearthproducts industry revenues are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factorsas well, including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates,consumer confidence, disposable income, changing demographics, and hearthindustry revenues. Industry factors, such as technology changes, health andsafety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air qualitystandards, also influence hearth products industry revenues. There can be no assurance that current or future economic or industry trends will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Increasinghealthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financialcondition. Weprovide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members. Healthcare costshave continued to rise over time and could adversely affect our business,operating results, or financial condition. Ourinability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independentdealers or the loss of a significant number of such dealers could adverselyaffect our business, operating results, or financial condition. In both the officer furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers. We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers. Our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason. The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Ourincreasing international operations expose us to risks related to conductingbusiness in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States. Weprimarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. Dollars;however we have increasingly been conducting business in countries outside theUnited States, which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchangerates. Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significantincrease or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. Dollars,which may affect our profits. In the future, any foreign currency appreciationrelative to the U.S. Dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated inthat currency. Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. Dollar, ourfinancial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countrieswhere we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. Dollar. Wereview our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter intohedging transactions. We may be vulnerable to the effects of currency exchangerate fluctuations. Ourinternational sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks,including, without limitation:                   social and political turmoil, officialcorruption and civil unrest;                  restrictive government actions, such as theimposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;                  changes in labor laws and regulationsaffecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;                  the need to comply with multiple andpotentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental laws andregulations;                  preference for locally branded products andlaws and business practices favoring local competition;                  less effective protection of intellectualproperty;                  unfavorable business conditions or economicinstability in any particular country or region; and                  difficulty in obtaining distribution andsupport. Therecan be no assurance that these and other factors will not have an adverseaffect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. 14 We may not be able to maintain our effective tax rate. Wemay not be able to maintain our effective tax rate because (1) income taxbenefits may be offset by an increase in the valuation allowance due to theuncertainty regarding the ability to utilize the benefits in the future,(2) the losses incurred in certain jurisdictions may not offset the taxexpense in profitable jurisdictions, (3) there are differences betweenforeign and U.S. income tax rates, and (4) many tax years are subject toaudit by different tax jurisdictions, which audits may result in additionaltaxes payable. Restrictionsimposed by the terms of our existing credit facility may limit our operatingand financial flexibility. Ourexisting credit facility limits our ability to finance operations, service debtor engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. Specifically,our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness,create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets,engage in lines of business substantially different than those currentlyconducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enterinto certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments ortake certain restricted actions, and enter into certain sale-leasebackarrangements. Our credit facility also requires us to maintain certainfinancial covenants. Ourfailure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result inan event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration ofthe indebtedness under the credit facility. We cannot be certain that we willhave sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated indebtedness or that wewill have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorableto us or at all. We mayrequire additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may beavailable only on unfavorable terms. Ourcapital requirements depend on many factors, including capital improvements,tooling, new product development, and acquisitions. To the extent that ourexisting capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover anylosses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail ourgrowth and reduce our assets. Our ability to generate cash depends on economic,financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that may bebeyond our control. Future borrowings or financings may not be available to usunder our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us topay our debt or meet our liquidity needs. Anyequity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms that are notfavorable to us. In addition, financings could result in dilution to ourshareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges thatare senior to those of our common stock. If our need for capital arises becauseof significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it moredifficult for us to raise the necessary capital. Ourbusiness is subject to a number of other miscellaneous risks that may adverselyaffect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Othermiscellaneous risks include, among others:                   uncertainty related to disruptions ofbusiness by accidents, third-party labor disputes, terrorism, military action,natural disasters, epidemic, acts of God, or other force majeure events;                   reduced demand for our storage productscaused by changes in office technology, including the change from paper recordstorage to electronic record storage;                   the effects of economic conditions on demandfor office furniture and hearth products, customer insolvencies, bankruptciesand related bad debts and claims against us that we received preferentialpayments;                   our ability to realize cost savings andproductivity improvements from our cost containment and business simplificationinitiatives;                   our ability to realize financial benefitsfrom our repurchases of common stock;                   volatility in the market price and tradingvolume of equity securities may adversely affect the market price for ourcommon stock;                   our ability to protect our intellectualproperty; 15                   potential claims by third-parties that weinfringed upon their intellectual property rights;                   our insurance may not adequately insulate usfrom expenses for product defects; and                   our ability to retain our experiencedmanagement team and recruit other key personnel. "
