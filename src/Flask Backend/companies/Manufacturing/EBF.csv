11,EBF,ENNIS INC,2023-05-12,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event, our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.Risks related to our business and operationsOur results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and competitors’ pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.Our results of operations can be affected by local, national and worldwide market conditions. The consequences of domestic and international economic uncertainty or instability, volatility in commodity markets, and domestic or international policy uncertainty, all of which we have seen in the past, can all impact economic activity. Unfavorable conditions can depress the demand for our products and thus sales in a given market and may prompt competitor’s pricing strategies that adversely affect our margins or constrain our operating flexibility. Certain macroeconomic events, such as crises in the financial markets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could also adversely affect us. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted local, national and worldwide economies, and introduced market volatility. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends on several factors, including (i) our ability to manage movements in commodity prices and the impact of government actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending, inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the past volatility in the global financial markets, (ii) the impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturing facilities and (iii) other factors, which may be beyond our control.8 Digital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.The increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipment combined with our customers’ general preference, as well as governmental influences for paperless business environments will continue to reduce the number of traditional printed documents sold.  Moreover, the documents that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain less value-added print content.Many of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processes and facilitate the flow of information. These applications will increasingly be conducted over the internet or through other electronic payment systems. The predominant method of our customers’ communication to their customers is by printed information. As their customers become more accepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for what is perceived to be a less costly electronic option, which would reduce our revenue. The pace of these trends is difficult to predict. These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents and require us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue which could place pressure on our operating margins. In response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, and we are unable to increase our market share, our sales and profits will be affected. Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins or impact the value of our recorded goodwill and intangible assets. This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.We obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption in our relationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials or material shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.We currently purchase the majority of our paper products from one major supplier at favorable costs based on the volume of business, and traditionally we have purchased our paper products from a limited number of suppliers, all of which must meet stringent quality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts.  Fluctuations in the quality of our paper, unexpected price changes or other factors that relate to our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic made it more expensive or more difficult to source raw materials for our products, whether from our existing suppliers or new suppliers.  Paper supply and other raw materials were limited, and due to tight demand and supply there was a significant amount of upward pressure on prices. Paper is a commodity that is subject to frequent increases or decreases in price, and these fluctuations are sometimes significant.  The prices for paper and many of our raw materials have been volatile and may continue to increase due to overall inflationary pressure and global market conditions. We believe there is no effective market of derivative instruments to insulate us against unexpected changes in price of paper in a cost-effective manner, and negotiated purchase contracts provide only limited protection against price increases.  Generally, when paper prices increase, we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers.  In the price-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, however, we may not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs.  As such, any significant increase in the price of paper or shortage in its availability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Challenging financial market conditions and changes in long-term interest rates could adversely impact the funded status of our pension plan.We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (the “Pension Plan”) covering approximately 13% of our employees. As of February 28, 2023, the Pension Plan was 99% funded on a projected benefit obligation (PBO) basis and 105% on an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) basis.  Included in our financial results are Pension Plan costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results. In addition, as our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, fluctuations in market values can negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels. A decline in long-term debt interest rates puts downward pressure on the discount rate used by plan sponsors to determine their pension liabilities. Each 10 basis point change in the discount rate impacts our computed pension liability by 9 approximately $525,000. Similar to fluctuations in market values, a drop in the discount rate can negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability and future contribution levels. Also, continued changes in the mortality assumptions can impact our funded status. Additionally, as we experienced in recent months, the number of retirees taking lump sum distributions could be sufficiently high as to cause a settlement charge, which would impact current earnings of the Pension Plan. We may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.We have evaluated, and may continue to evaluate, potential acquisition transactions.  We attempt to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the attractiveness of acquisition candidates, as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire.  Integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties, including maintenance of uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; diversion of management’s attention from normal business operations during the integration process; unplanned expenses associated with integration efforts; and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence, including legal contingencies.  Due to these risks and others, there can be no guarantee that the businesses we acquire will lead to the cost savings or increases in net sales that we expect or desire.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future, which could harm our strategic business plan as acquisitions are part of our strategy to offset normal print attrition.Our distributor customers may be acquired by other manufacturers who redirect business within their plants.Some of our customers are being absorbed by the distribution channels of some of our manufacturing competitors.  However, we do not believe this will significantly impact our business model.  We have continued to sell to some of these customers even after they were absorbed by our competition because of the breadth of our product line and our geographic diversity. Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supply superstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.Low price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many of these products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of “one-stop” shopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition, superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts to expand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which could reduce our profits.We could experience labor disputes, labor shortages and increases in cost of labor that could disrupt our business in the future and impact operating results.As of February 28, 2023, approximately 8% of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations.  While we believe we have a good working relationship with all of the unions, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.Conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic factors have contributed to tightening and increased competitiveness in the labor market, increasing labor costs. A prolonged labor shortage could potentially adversely affect our business operations and further increase labor costs.We face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.Our marketing strategy is to differentiate ourselves by providing quality service and quality products to our customers.  Even if this strategy is successful, the results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors’ pricing strategies or other micro or macro-economic factors.  We face the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling its products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in stressed economic times.10 Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results. We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards, concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal, and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.We are subject to taxation related risks. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. Applicable tax rates and the jurisdictions within which we operate can vary and therefore our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of our earnings by jurisdiction. We may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Income, sales or other tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are applied. Most recently, on August 16, 2022, legislation commonly known as the Inflation Reduction Act (the ""IRA"") was signed into law.  Among other things, the IRA includes a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases, applicable to repurchases after December 31, 2022, and also a new minimum tax based on book income.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our federal corporate tax rate, our deferred income taxes and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system. There may be changes in tax legislation, including a repeal or modification of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, changes in tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out or eliminating deductions, revising tax law interpretations in jurisdictions, and changes in other tax laws. The U.S. government has proposed changes to increase the tax rates on corporations. All of these factors and uncertainties may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.We are exposed to the risk of non-payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales. Our extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers. We generally see a heightened amount of bankruptcies by our customers during economic downturns.  In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on our customers, could have a negative impact on our collection efforts. While we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other available information, in times of economic turmoil, there is heightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate. The inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business incurs significant freight and transportation costs. We incur transportation expenses to ship our products to our customers.  Significant increases in the costs of freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that we could pass on these increased costs to our customers.  Government regulations can and have impacted the availability of drivers, which will be a significant challenge to the transportation industry. Costs to employ drivers have increased and transportation shortages have become more prevalent. Additionally, the challenge of employing new drivers for the increasingly larger web-based economy could create shortages in trucks and drivers which could impact our sales.  During fiscal year 2023, we experienced significantly higher freight and transportation costs as a result of overall inflationary pressures, and transportation and logistics constraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.11 A natural disaster, catastrophe, pandemic or other unexpected events could adversely affect our operations.The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, epidemics or pandemics, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Although we maintain third party insurance against various liability risks and risks of property loss for items we believe are economically reasonable to insure, we could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant downturn in global economic activity and subsequently caused significant market volatility and operational challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Our sales were significantly impacted by economic conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in a decrease in sales volume and earnings in fiscal year 2021. While the demand for our products appears to have recovered in 2022 and 2023, economic uncertainties could continue to affect customer demand for our products and services, and the longer term effects of the pandemic, including supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures are unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We depend on the reliability of our IT and network infrastructure as well as those of third parties.  If these systems fail, our operations may be adversely affected.We depend on information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems may disrupt our business and adversely affect our ability to operate and compete in the markets we serve. This could take various forms, including through the injection of ransomware on our IT infrastructure rendering it inoperable without the payment of some form of cyber currency. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as systems of our vendors or other third parties. Such systems are susceptible to ransomware attacks, malfunctions, interruptions and phishing scams, for example.  We also periodically upgrade and install new systems, which if installed or programmed incorrectly, may cause significant disruptions.  These disruptions could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Increasing global cybersecurity attacks and regulatory focus on privacy and security issues could impact our business, expose us to increased liability, subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.Along with our own data and information in the normal course of our business, we and our customers and partners collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of data, some of which are subject to specific laws and regulations. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements is becoming increasingly complex and could increase the costs and difficulty of compliance, and violations of applicable data protection laws. Many of our clients provide us with information they consider confidential or sensitive, and many of our client’s industries have established standards for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information relating to their businesses and customers.  Data stored in our systems or available through web portals is susceptible to cybercrime or intentional disruption, which have increased globally across all industries in terms of sophistication and frequency.  Disclosure of data maintained on our network, a security breach of our systems or other similar events may damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory enforcement action, third party litigation and cause significant reputational or financial harm for our clients and partners.  Any of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.As previously disclosed, the Company was targeted with an encryption ransomware attack on November 30, 2022.  The attack was discovered while it was in process and immediate action was taken to isolate our network to limit the scope of any damage.  The attack resulted in a brief disruption to the operation of our systems as we took our servers offline to eradicate the ransomware and restore our data and applications from secure backups.  The Company did not 12 communicate with the ransomware threat actor and never considered paying any ransom demand.  Instead, the Company eliminated the ransomware and immediately proceeded to restore its critical files and functions.  The Company incurred no material expense in connection with the ransomware attack.  Based on the information currently known to date, the incident has not had a significant financial impact and the Company does not believe the incident will have a material impact on its business, results of operations or financial condition.  Despite us improving our Information Technology General Controls, we cannot give any assurances that the Company will not become the subject of a future more sophisticated, or more harmful attack. Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant.  Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.  Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may result in temporary or permanent healthcare reform measures, would could result in significant cost increases and other negative impacts to our business. While the Company has various cost control measures in place and employs an outside oversight review on larger claims, employee health benefits have been and are expected to continue to be a significant cost to us and may increase due to factors outside the Company’s control.Risks related to our securitiesBecause of the volatility in the stock market in general, the market price of our Common Stock will also likely be volatile.The stock markets have historically experienced price and volume fluctuations that at times have been extreme and have affected, and continue to affect, the market prices of equity securities of many companies.  These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.  Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory and market conditions, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.  If the market price of our Class A common stock falls below your investment price, you may lose some or all of your investment.  In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the marker price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation.  We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention.  "
1,EBF,ENNIS INC,2022-05-09,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event, our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The ongoing impacts of the public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results continue to be unknown.  The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected, and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Our sales were significantly impacted by economic conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in a decrease in sales volume and earnings in fiscal year 2021. While demand for our products appears to have recovered in 2022, the sustainability of the recovery remains unclear.The U.S. economy continues to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Parts of the economy have started to re-open but economic conditions remain subject to ongoing surges and local measures, creating a very fluid economic environment. Certain economic indicators, such as the improvement in the job market, reflect the continued resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy including labor market conditions, economic activity, supply-chain shortages and disruptions, inflationary pressure and demand for the Company’s products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited 8 to, material adverse effects on: demand for the Company’s products; the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section.Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and competitors’ pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.Our results of operations can be affected by local, national and worldwide market conditions. The consequences of domestic and international economic uncertainty or instability, volatility in commodity markets, and domestic or international policy uncertainty, all of which we have seen in the past, can all impact economic activity. Unfavorable conditions can depress the demand for our products and thus sales in a given market and may prompt competitor’s pricing strategies that adversely affect our margins or constrain our operating flexibility. Certain macroeconomic events, such as the past crisis in the financial markets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could also adversely affect us. In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted local, national and worldwide economies, and introduced market volatility. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends on several factors, including (i) our ability to manage movements in commodity prices and the impact of government actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending, inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the past volatility in the global financial markets, (ii) the impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturing facilities and (iii) other factors, which may be beyond our control.Digital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.The increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipment combined with our customers’ general preference, as well as governmental influences for paperless business environments will continue to reduce the number of traditional printed documents sold.  Moreover, the documents that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain less value-added print content.Many of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processes and facilitate the flow of information. These applications will increasingly be conducted over the internet or through other electronic payment systems. The predominant method of our customers’ communication to their customers is by printed information. As their customers become more accepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for what is perceived to be a less costly electronic option, which would reduce our revenue. The pace of these trends is difficult to predict. These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents and require us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue which could place pressure on our operating margins. In response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, and we are unable to increase our market share, our sales and profits will be affected. Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins or impact the value of our recorded goodwill and intangible assets. This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.We obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption in our relationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials or material shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.We currently purchase the majority of our paper products from one major supplier at favorable costs based on the volume of business, and traditionally we have purchased our paper products from a limited number of suppliers, all of which must meet stringent quality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts.  Fluctuations in the quality of our paper, unexpected price changes or other factors that relate to our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more expensive or more 9 difficult to source raw materials for our products, whether from our existing suppliers or new suppliers.  Paper supply and other raw materials have grown more limited, and due to tight demand and supply there has been a tremendous amount of upward pressure on prices. These challenges have and could in the future negatively impact the cost or availability of our raw materials. Paper is a commodity that is subject to frequent increases or decreases in price, and these fluctuations are sometimes significant.  The prices for paper and many of our raw materials have been volatile and may continue to increase due to overall inflationary pressure and global market conditions. We believe there is no effective market of derivative instruments to insulate us against unexpected changes in price of paper in a cost-effective manner, and negotiated purchase contracts provide only limited protection against price increases.  Generally, when paper prices increase, we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers.  In the price-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, however, we may not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs.  As such, any significant increase in the price of paper or shortage in its availability, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the strength of the U.S. dollar, changes in mill ownership or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Challenging financial market conditions and changes in long-term interest rates could adversely impact the funded status of our pension plan.We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (the “Pension Plan”) covering approximately 13% of our employees. Included in our financial results are Pension Plan costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results. In addition, as our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels. A decline in long-term debt interest rates puts downward pressure on the discount rate used by plan sponsors to determine their pension liabilities. Each 10 basis point change in the discount rate impacts our computed pension liability by approximately $750,000. Similar to fluctuations in market values, a drop in the discount rate could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability and future contribution levels. Also, continued changes in the mortality tables could potentially impact our funded status. Additionally, as we experienced in recent months, the number of retirees taking lump sum distributions could be sufficiently high as to cause a settlement charge, which would impact current earnings of the Pension Plan. As of February 28, 2022, the Pension Plan was 91% funded on a projected benefit obligation (PBO) basis and 98% on an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) basis.We may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.We have evaluated, and may continue to evaluate, potential acquisition transactions.  We attempt to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the attractiveness of acquisition candidates, as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire.  Integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties, including maintenance of uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; diversion of management’s attention from normal business operations during the integration process; unplanned expenses associated with integration efforts; and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence, including legal contingencies.  Due to these risks and others, there can be no guarantee that the businesses we acquire will lead to the cost savings or increases in net sales that we expect or desire.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future, which could harm our strategic business plan as acquisitions are part of our strategy to offset normal print attrition.We may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future.When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable tangible assets acquired.  The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment.  An impairment may be caused by any number of factors outside our control, such as a decline in market conditions, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, another pandemic or some other event, protracted recovery from poor market conditions, or other factors that may be tied to such negative economic events, including changes to a competitor’s pricing strategies.  To date, we have not been required to take an impairment charge relating to our existing business, but continued sale-side pressures due to technology transference, competitor 10 pricing pressures, and economic uncertainties could result in a determination that a portion of the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets may be required to be written down. Although an impairment charge relating to our existing business would be a noncash expense, it would impact our reported operating results and financial position. The Company has mitigated some of this risk by changing from indefinite lives to definite lives accounting for all intangibles assets.Under definite lives accounting, the value of intangible assets is gradually amortized over time, instead of being left on the Company’s books in full and only being written down when an impairment event is deemed to have occurred.  At February 28, 2022, our consolidated goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $88.7 million and $45.6 million, respectively.Our distributor customers may be acquired by other manufacturers who redirect business within their plants.Some of our customers are being absorbed by the distribution channels of some of our manufacturing competitors.  However, we do not believe this will significantly impact our business model.  We have continued to sell to some of these customers even after they were absorbed by our competition because of the breadth of our product line and our geographic diversity. Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supply superstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.Low price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many of these products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of “one-stop” shopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition, superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts to expand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which could reduce our profits.We could experience labor disputes, labor shortages and increases in cost of labor that could disrupt our business in the future and impact operating results.As of February 28, 2022, approximately 9% of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations.  While we believe we have a good working relationship with all of the unions, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.Conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other economic factors have contributed to tightening and increased competitiveness in the labor market, increasing labor costs. A prolonged labor shortage could potentially adversely affect our business operations and further increase labor costs.We face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.Our marketing strategy is to differentiate ourselves by providing quality service and quality products to our customers.  Even if this strategy is successful, the results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors’ pricing strategies or other micro or macro-economic factors.  We face the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling its products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in stressed economic times.11 Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results. We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards, concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal, and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.We are subject to taxation related risks. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state jurisdictions. The tax rates applicable and the jurisdictions within which we operate can vary and therefore our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of our earnings by jurisdiction. We may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Income, sales or other tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are applied. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our federal corporate tax rate, our deferred income taxes and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system There may be changes in tax legislation, including a repeal or modification of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, changes in tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out or eliminating deductions, revising tax law interpretations in jurisdictions, and changes in other tax laws. The U.S. government has proposed changes to increase the tax rates on corporations. All of these factors and uncertainties may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.We are exposed to the risk of non-payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales. Our extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers. We generally see a heightened amount of bankruptcies by our customers during economic downturns.  In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on our customers, could have a negative impact on our collection efforts. While we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other available information, in times of economic turmoil, there is heightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate. The inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business incurs significant freight and transportation costs. We incur transportation expenses to ship our products to our customers.  Significant increases in the costs of freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that we could pass on these increased costs to our customers.  Government regulations can and have impacted the availability of drivers, which will be a significant challenge to the transportation industry. Costs to employ drivers have increased and transportation shortages have become more prevalent. Additionally, the challenge of employing new drivers for the increasingly larger web-based economy could create shortages in trucks and drivers which could impact our sales.A natural disaster, catastrophe, pandemic or other unexpected events could adversely affect our operations.The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, epidemics or pandemics, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the United States could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Although we maintain third party insurance against various liability risks and risks of property loss for items we believe are economically reasonable to 12 insure, we could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.If our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price could be adversely affected.We believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place. However, increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized. In addition, if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.We depend on the reliability of our IT and network infrastructure as well as those of third parties.  If these systems fail, our operations may be adversely affected.We depend on information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems may disrupt our business and adversely affect our ability to operate and compete in the markets we serve. This could take various forms, including through the injection of Ransomware on our IT infrastructure rendering it inoperable without the payment of some form of cyber currency. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as systems of our vendors or other third parties. Such systems are susceptible to Ransomware attacks, malfunctions, interruptions and phishing scams, for example.  We also periodically upgrade and install new systems, which if installed or programmed incorrectly, may cause significant disruptions.  These disruptions could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Increasing global cybersecurity attacks and regulatory focus on privacy and security issues could impact our business, expose us to increased liability, subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.Along with our own data and information in the normal course of our business, we and our customers and partners collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of data, some of which are subject to specific laws and regulations. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements is becoming increasingly complex and could increase the costs and difficulty of compliance, and violations of applicable data protection laws. Many of our clients provide us with information they consider confidential or sensitive, and many of our client’s industries have established standards for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information relating to their businesses and customers.  Data stored in our systems or available through web portals is susceptible to cybercrime or intentional disruption, which have increased globally across all industries in terms of sophistication and frequency.  Disclosure of data maintained on our network, a security breach of our systems or other similar events may damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory enforcement action, third party litigation and cause significant reputational or financial harm for our clients and partners.  Any of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant.  Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.  Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system.  Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in temporary or permanent healthcare reform measures, would could result in significant cost increases and other negative impacts to our business. While the Company has various cost control measures in place and employs an outside oversight review on larger claims, employee health benefits have been and are expected to continue to be a significant cost to us and may increase due to factors outside the Company’s control. 13 "

The risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event, our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected, and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Our sales were significantly impacted by economic conditions driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in a decrease in sales volume and earnings.The U.S. economy continues to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and parts of the economy have started to re-open as vaccinations become more prevalent, but remain subject to ongoing surges and local shutdowns, creating a very fluid economic environment. Certain economic indicators, such as the improvement in the job market, reflect the continued resumption of economic activity that had been curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Job growth was encouraging in March, led by gains in leisure and hospitality, public and private education, and construction. We continue to monitor incoming order volumes so that we can proactively adjust our costs accordingly.8While some restrictions have been lifted or eased in many jurisdictions, the situation remains fluid and the Company is continuing to monitor the situation and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for the Company’s products. Additional future impacts on the Company may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on: demand for the Company’s products, the Company’s supply chain and sales and distribution channels; the Company’s ability to execute its strategic plans; and the Company’s profitability and cost structure.To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section.Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and competitors’ pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.Our results of operations can be affected by local, national and worldwide market conditions. The consequences of domestic and international economic uncertainty or instability, volatility in commodity markets, and domestic or international policy uncertainty, all of which we have seen in the past, can all impact economic activity. Unfavorable conditions can depress the demand for our products and thus sales in a given market and may prompt competitor’s pricing strategies that adversely affect our margins or constrain our operating flexibility. Certain macroeconomic events, such as the past crisis in the financial markets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could also adversely affect us. In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted local, national and worldwide economies, and introduced market volatility. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends on several factors, including (i) our ability to manage movements in commodity prices and the impact of government actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending, inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the past volatility in the global financial markets, (ii) the impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturing facilities and (iii) other factors, which may be beyond our control.Digital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.The increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipment combined with our customers’ general preference, as well as governmental influences for paperless business environments will continue to reduce the number of traditional printed documents sold.  Moreover, the documents that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain less value-added print content.Many of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processes and facilitate the flow of information. These applications will increasingly be conducted over the internet or through other electronic payment systems. The predominant method of our customers’ communication to their customers is by printed information. As their customers become more accepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for what is perceived to be a less costly electronic option, which would reduce our revenue. The pace of these trends is difficult to predict. These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents and require us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue which could place pressure on our operating margins.  In response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, and we are unable to increase our market share, our sales and profits will be affected. Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins or impact the value of our recorded goodwill and intangible assets. This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.We obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption in our relationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials or material shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.9We currently purchase the majority of our paper products from one major supplier at favorable costs based on the volume of business, and traditionally we have purchased our paper products from a limited number of suppliers, all of which must meet stringent quality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts.  Fluctuations in the quality of our paper, unexpected price changes or other factors that relate to our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may make it more expensive or more difficult to source raw materials for our products, whether from our existing suppliers or new suppliers, and these challenges could negatively impact the cost or availability of our raw materials. Paper is a commodity that is subject to frequent increases or decreases in price, and these fluctuations are sometimes significant.  Domestic paper prices have increased and decreased in recent years due to global market conditions. We believe there is no effective market of derivative instruments to insulate us against unexpected changes in price of paper in a cost-effective manner, and negotiated purchase contracts provide only limited protection against price increases.  Generally, when paper prices increase, we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers.  In the price-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, however, we may not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs.  As such, any significant increase in the price of paper or shortage in its availability, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the strength of the U.S. dollar, changes in mill ownership or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations.  We may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, for proposed expansion projects.The terms and conditions of our current facility impose certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquisitions and asset dispositions, as well as impose other customary covenants, such as requiring that our fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than 1.25:1.00 and our total leverage ratio not exceed 3.00:1:00. Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as distressed and volatile financial and/or consumer markets, including due to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A breach of any of the covenants could result in a default under our credit facility and in the event of such a default, the bank could elect to declare outstanding principal amounts, interest thereon, and any other amounts payable under the facility to be immediately due and payable. While the Company has no borrowings outstanding under the current credit facility, it does come up for renewal in November of this year. Should events occur which provide uncertainty in the marketplace, the Company could be constrained in the amount or terms of a renewal credit facility. While the Company’s cash position currently provides a liquidity cushion such that it is unlikely that the failure to obtain a replacement or extended credit facility would result in a negative impact, it could impact the Company’s ability to acquire a larger company in an acquisition, among other things. As of February 28, 2021, we were in compliance with all terms and conditions of our credit facility, which matures on November 11, 2021.Challenging financial market conditions and continued decline in long-term interest rates could adversely impact the funded status of our pension plan.We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (the “Pension Plan”) covering approximately 13% of our employees. Included in our financial results are Pension Plan costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results. In addition, as our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels. A decline in long-term debt interest rates puts downward pressure on the discount rate used by plan sponsors to determine their pension liabilities. Each 10 basis point change in the discount rate impacts our computed pension liability by approximately $800,000. Similar to fluctuations in market values, a drop in the discount rate could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability and future contribution levels. Also, continued changes in the mortality tables could potentially impact our funded status. Additionally, as we experienced in recent months, the number of retirees taking lump sum distributions could be sufficiently high as to cause a settlement charge, which would impact current earnings. As of February 28, 2021, the Pension Plan was 90.5% funded on a projected benefit obligation (PBO) basis and 97.9% on an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) basis.We may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.We have evaluated, and may continue to evaluate, potential acquisition transactions.  We attempt to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the attractiveness of acquisition candidates, as well as other challenges such as 10retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire.  Integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties, including maintenance of uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; diversion of management’s attention from normal business operations during the integration process; unplanned expenses associated with integration efforts; and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence, including legal contingencies.  Due to these risks and others, there can be no guarantee that the businesses we acquire will lead to the cost savings or increases in net sales that we expect or desire.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future, which could harm our strategic business plan as acquisitions are part of our strategy to offset normal print attrition.We may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future.When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable tangible assets acquired.  The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment.  An impairment may be caused by any number of factors outside our control, such as a decline in market conditions, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, another pandemic or some other event, protracted recovery from poor market conditions, or other factors that may be tied to such negative economic events, including changes to a competitor’s pricing strategies.  To date, we have not been required to take an impairment charge relating to our existing business, but continued sale-side pressures due to technology transference, competitor pricing pressures, and economic uncertainties could result in a determination that a portion of the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets may be required to be written down. Although an impairment charge relating to our existing business, but continued sale-side pressures due to technology would be a noncash expense, it would impact our reported operating results and financial position. The Company has mitigated some of this risk by changing from indefinite lives to definite lives accounting for all intangibles assets.Under definite lives accounting, the value of intangible assets is gradually amortized over time, instead of being left on the Company’s books in full and only being written down when an impairment event is deemed to have occurred.  At February 28, 2021, our consolidated goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $88.6 million and $52.7 million, respectively.Our distributor customers may be acquired by other manufacturers who redirect business within their plants.Some of our customers are being absorbed by the distribution channels of some of our manufacturing competitors.  However, we do not believe this will significantly impact our business model.  We have continued to sell to some of these customers even after they were absorbed by our competition because of the breadth of our product line and our geographic diversity.  Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supply superstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.Low price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many of these products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of “one-stop” shopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition, superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts to expand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which could reduce our profits.We could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.As of February 28, 2021, approximately 9% of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations.  While we believe we have a good working relationship with all of the unions, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.11We face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.Our marketing strategy is to differentiate ourselves by providing quality service and quality products to our customers.  Even if this strategy is successful, the results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors’ pricing strategies or other micro or macro-economic factors.  We face the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling its products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in stressed economic times.Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results. We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards, concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal, and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.We are subject to taxation related risks. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are applied. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 resulted in changes in our federal corporate tax rate, our deferred income taxes and limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system There may be changes in tax legislation, including a repeal or modification of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, changes in tax rates and tax base such as limiting, phasing-out or eliminating deductions, revising tax law interpretations in jurisdictions, and changes in other tax laws. There are currently proposals in Congress to increase the tax rates on corporations. All of these factors and uncertainties may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.We are exposed to the risk of non-payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales. Our extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers. We generally see a heightened amount of bankruptcies by our customers during economic downturns.  In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on our customers, could have a negative impact on our collection efforts. While we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other available information, in times of economic turmoil, there is heightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate. The inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business incurs significant freight and transportation costs. We incur transportation expenses to ship our products to our customers.  Significant increases in the costs of freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that we could pass on these increased costs to our customers.  Government regulations can and have impacted the availability of drivers, which will be a significant challenge to the transportation industry. Costs to employ drivers have increased and transportation shortages have become more prevalent. Additionally, the challenge of employing new drivers for the increasingly larger web-based economy could create shortages in trucks and drivers which could impact our sales.A natural disaster, catastrophe, pandemic or other unexpected events could adversely affect our operations.The occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism or violence, civil unrest, epidemics or pandemics, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in the 12United States could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Although we maintain third party insurance against various liability risks and risks of property loss for items we believe are economically reasonable to insure, we could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.If our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price could be adversely affected.We believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place. However, increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized. In addition, if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.We depend on the reliability of our IT and network infrastructure as well as those of third parties.  If these systems fail, our operations may be adversely affected.We depend on information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems may disrupt our business and adversely affect our ability to operate and compete in the markets we serve. This could take various forms, including through the injection of Ransomware on our IT infrastructure rendering it inoperable without the payment of some form of cyber currency. These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as systems of our vendors or other third parties. Such systems are susceptible to Ransomware attacks, malfunctions, interruptions and phishing scams, for example.  We also periodically upgrade and install new systems, which if installed or programmed incorrectly, may cause significant disruptions.  These disruptions could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Increasing global cybersecurity attacks and regulatory focus on privacy and security issues could impact our business, expose us to increased liability, subject us to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business.Along with our own data and information in the normal course of our business, we and our customers and partners collect and retain significant volumes of certain types of data, some of which are subject to specific laws and regulations. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements is becoming increasingly complex and could increase the costs and difficulty of compliance, and violations of applicable data protection laws. Many of our clients provide us with information they consider confidential or sensitive, and many of our client’s industries have established standards for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information relating to their businesses and customers.  Data stored in our systems or available through web portals is susceptible to cybercrime or intentional disruption, which have increased globally across all industries in terms of sophistication and frequency.  Disclosure of data maintained on our network, a security breach of our systems or other similar events may damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory enforcement action, third party litigation and cause significant reputational or financial harm for our clients and partners.  Any of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant.  Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.  Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system.  Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in temporary or permanent healthcare reform measures, would could result in significant cost increases and other negative impacts to our business. While the Company has various cost control measures in place and employs an outside oversight review on larger claims, employee health benefits have been and are expected to continue to be a significant cost to the us and may increase due to factors outside the Company’s control. 13 "
9,EBF,ENNIS INC,2020-05-04,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event, our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our business may be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.       In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China, and by early 2020, the virus had spread to other countries, including the United States.  The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant threat to the health and economic wellbeing affecting our customers, suppliers and workforce.  Federal, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and have imposed, or are considering, quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory closures of businesses deemed “non-essential” in certain jurisdictions.  As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our plants are deemed “essential,” largely due to our business’s support of many important sectors of the economy, including healthcare, government, food and beverage and banking, and thus most of our plants are currently operating at close-to-normal utilization levels.  As the virus continues to evolve, however, authorities could take new steps to control the outbreak, which could result in the determination that our plants are no longer “essential” and therefore must close, among other outcomes.  Even if our plants are not forced to close by government regulation, the virus, in addition to prolonged stay-at-home orders or other related regulations, could depress consumer demand or disrupt our supply chain.  Depending on these developments and others, we may deem it necessary to close plants, furlough or lay off employees or take other cost-cutting measures. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak within the markets in which we operate, the related impact on our customers and suppliers and the possibility of an economic recession after the virus has subsided, all of which are highly uncertain and ever-changing.  Any of these factors could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our sales and damage our results of operations and liquidity.  The severity and duration of any such impacts, including after the virus has subsided, cannot be predicted.Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and competitors’ pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.Our results of operations can be affected by local, national and worldwide market conditions.  The consequences of domestic and international economic uncertainty or instability, volatility in commodity markets, and domestic or international policy uncertainty, all of which we have seen in the past, can all impact economic activity.  Unfavorable conditions can depress the demand for our products and thus sales in a given market and may prompt competitor’s pricing strategies that adversely affect our margins or constrain our operating flexibility.  Certain macroeconomic events, such as the past crisis in the financial markets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could also adversely affect us.  In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted local, national and worldwide economies, introduced extreme market volatility and, depending on severity and duration, may potentially trigger a prolonged nationwide or global recession.  Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends on several factors, including (i) our ability to manage movements in commodity prices and the impact of government actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending, inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the past volatility in the global financial markets, (ii) the impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturing facilities and (iii) other factors, which may be beyond our control.7The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations.  We may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, for proposed expansion projects.The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquisitions and asset dispositions, as well as impose other customary covenants, such as requiring that our fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than 1.25:1.00 and our total leverage ratio not exceed 3.00:1:00.  Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as distressed and volatile financial and/or consumer markets, including due to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility.  In the event of a default, the bank could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable.  As of February 29, 2020, we were in compliance with all terms and conditions of our credit facility, which matures on November 11, 2021.Challenging financial market conditions and continued decline in long-term interest rates could adversely impact the funded status of our pension plan.We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (the “Pension Plan”) covering approximately 16% of our employees.  Included in our financial results are Pension Plan costs that are measured using actuarial valuations.  The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results.  In addition, as our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels.  A decline in long-term debt interest rates puts downward pressure on the discount rate used by plan sponsors to determine their pension liabilities.  Each 10 basis point change in the discount rate impacts our computed pension liability by about $930,000.  Similar to fluctuations in market values, a drop in the discount rate could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability and future contribution levels.  Also, continued changes in the mortality tables could potentially impact our funded status.  As of February 29, 2020, the Pension Plan was 87.2% funded on a projected benefit obligation (PBO) basis and 95.7% on an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) basis.We may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.We have evaluated, and may continue to evaluate, potential acquisition transactions.  We attempt to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the attractiveness of acquisition candidates, as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire.  Integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties, including maintenance of uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; diversion of management’s attention from normal business operations during the integration process; unplanned expenses associated with integration efforts; and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence, including legal contingencies.  Due to these risks and others, there can be no guarantee that the businesses we acquire will lead to the cost savings or increases in net sales that we expect or desire.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future, which could harm our strategic business plan as acquisitions are part of our strategy to offset normal print attrition.We may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future.When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable tangible assets acquired.  The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment.  An impairment may be caused by any number of factors outside our control, such as a decline in market conditions, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, another pandemic or some other event, protracted recovery from poor market conditions, or other factors that may be tied to such negative economic events, including changes to a competitor’s pricing strategies.  To date, we have not been required to take an impairment charge relating to our existing business, but continued sale-side pressures due to technology transference, competitor pricing pressures, and economic uncertainties could result in a determination that a portion of the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets may be required to be written down. Although such a charge impairment charge relating to our existing business, but continued sale-side pressures due to technology would be a noncash expense, it would impact our reported operating results and financial position. The Company has mitigated some of this risk by changing from indefinite lives to definite lives accounting for all intangibles assets.8Under definite lives accounting, the value of intangible assets is gradually amortized over time, instead of being left on the Company’s books in full and only being written down when an impairment event is deemed to have occurred.  At February 29, 2020, our consolidated goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $82.5 million and $56.6 million, respectively.Digital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.The increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipment combined with our customers’ general preference, as well as governmental influences for paperless business environments will continue to reduce the number of traditional printed documents sold.  Moreover, the documents that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain less value-added print content.Many of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processes and facilitate the flow of information.  These applications will increasingly be conducted over the internet or through other electronic payment systems.  The predominant method of our customers’ communication to their customers is by printed information.  As their customers become more accepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for what is perceived to be less costly electronic option, which would reduce our revenue.  The pace of these trends is difficult to predict.  These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents and require us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue which could place pressure on our operating margins.  In response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, and we are unable to increase our market share, our sales and profits will be affected.  Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins or impact the value of our recorded goodwill and intangible assets. This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.Our distributor customers may be acquired by other manufacturers who redirect business within their plants.Some of our customers are being absorbed by the distribution channels of some of our manufacturing competitors.  However, we do not believe this will significantly impact our business model.  We have continued to sell to some of these customers even after they were absorbed by our competition because of the breadth of our product line and our geographic diversity.  Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supply superstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.Low price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many of these products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of “one-stop” shopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition, superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts to expand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which could reduce our profits.Technological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over some of our competitors, which could reduce our profits.Improvements in the cost and quality of digital print technology is enabling some of our competitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs. Increased competition from these competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order to attract and retain customers, which could reduce our profits.We could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.As of February 29, 2020, approximately 10% of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations.  While we believe we have a good working 9relationship with all of the unions, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.We obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption in our relationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials or material shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.We currently purchase the majority of our paper products from one major supplier at favorable costs based on the volume of business, and traditionally we have purchased our paper products from a limited number of suppliers, all of which must meet stringent quality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts.  Fluctuations in the quality of our paper, unexpected price changes or other factors that relate to our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  In particular, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may make it more expensive or more difficult to source raw materials for our products, whether from our existing suppliers or new suppliers, and these challenges could negatively impact the cost or availability of our raw materials. Paper is a commodity that is subject to frequent increases or decreases in price, and these fluctuations are sometimes significant.  Domestic paper prices have increased and decreased in recent years due to global market conditions.  There is no effective market of derivative instruments to insulate us against unexpected changes in price of paper in a cost-effective manner, and negotiated purchase contracts provide only limited protection against price increases.  Generally, when paper prices increase, we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers.  In the price-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, however, we may not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs.  As such, any significant increase in the price of paper or shortage in its availability, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the strength of the U.S. dollar, changes in mill ownership or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.We face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.Our marketing strategy is to differentiate ourselves by providing quality service and quality products to our customers.  Even if this strategy is successful, the results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors’ pricing strategies or other micro or macro-economic factors.  We face the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling its products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in stressed economic times.Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results. We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards, concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal, and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.We are subject to taxation related risks. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are applied.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""). The Tax Act includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including, among other things, a federal corporate rate reduction from 35% to 21%; limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and executive compensation and the transition of U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system.  In the future, we may be subject to increased taxes under the Tax Act, including due to the aforementioned limitations on deductions.  Also, we may be required to make material adjustments to provisional items recorded.  There can be no assurance that U.S. tax laws, including the corporate income tax rate, which the Tax Act lowered to 21%, would not undergo additional changes in the future.  The final impact of the Tax Act on 10the Company may differ from the estimates previously reported, possibly materially, due to such factors as changes in interpretations and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued, and actions taken by the Company as a result of the Tax Act, among other factors.  All of these factors and uncertainties may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.We are exposed to the risk of non-payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales. Our extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition and payment history.  We monitor our credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers.  We generally see a heightened amount of bankruptcies by our customers during economic downturns.  In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on our customers, could have a negative impact on our collection efforts.  While we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other available information, in times of economic turmoil, there is heightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate.  The inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business incurs significant freight and transportation costs. We incur transportation expenses to ship our products to our customers.  Significant increases in the costs of freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that we could pass on these increased costs to our customers.  Government regulations can and has impacted the availability of drivers, which will be a significant challenge to the industry.  Costs to employ drivers have increased and transportation shortages have become more prevalent.We depend upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals, many of whom would be difficult to replace.The loss or interruption of the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President or Chief Financial Officer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we maintain employment agreements with these individuals, it cannot be assured that the services of such individuals will continue.If our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price could be adversely affected.We believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place.  However, increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized.  In addition, if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.Our services depend on the reliability of computer systems we and our vendors maintain.  If these systems fail, our operations may be adversely affected.We depend on information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems may disrupt our business and adversely affect our ability to operate and compete in the markets we serve.  These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as systems of our vendors.  Such systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions.  We also periodically upgrade and install new systems, which if installed or programmed incorrectly, may cause significant disruptions.  The disruptions could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.11We may suffer a data breach of sensitive information, which may result in significant costs to investigate and remediate the breach, litigation expenses and government enforcement actions and penalties, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and reputation.It is critically important for us to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions.  Many of our clients provide us with information they consider confidential or sensitive, and many of our client’s industries have established standards for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information relating to their businesses and customers.  Confidential and sensitive information stored in our systems or available through web portals are susceptible to cybercrime or intentional disruption, which generally have increased across all industries in terms of sophistication and frequency.  Disclosure of confidential information maintained on our systems or available through web portals due to human error, breach of our systems through cybercrime, a leak of confidential information due to employee misconduct or similar events may damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory enforcement action and cause significant reputational harm for our clients.  Any of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant.  Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.  Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system.  Additionally, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may result in temporary or permanent healthcare reform measures, would could result in significant cost increases and other negative impacts to our business. While the Company has various cost controls measures in place and employs an outside oversight review on larger claims, employee health benefits have been and are expected to continue to be a significant cost to the Company.  At the beginning of the 2017 calendar year, the Company made significant changes to its medical reimbursement program to address unexpected cost increases.  Even with these remedial measures, which have been successful thus far, medical costs will continue to be a significant expense to the Company and may increase due to factors outside the Company’s control"

The risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event, our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and competitors’ pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.Our results of operations can be affected by local, national and worldwide market conditions.  The consequences of domestic and international economic uncertainty or instability, volatility in commodity markets, and domestic or international policy uncertainty, all of which we have seen in the past, can all impact economic activity.   Unfavorable conditions can depress the demand for our products and thus sales in a given market and may prompt competitor’s pricing strategies that adversely affect our margins or constrain our operating flexibility.  Certain macroeconomic events, such as the past crisis in the financial markets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could also adversely affect us.  Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainly on the following: •Our ability to manage movements in commodity prices and the impact of government actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending, inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the past volatility in the global financial markets; and •The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturing facilities.The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations.  We may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, for proposed expansion projects.The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquisitions and asset dispositions, as well as impose other customary covenants, such as requiring that our fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than 1.25:1.00 and our total leverage ratio not exceed 3.00:1:00.  Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as distressed and volatile financial and/or consumer markets.  A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility.  In the event of a default, the bank could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable.  As of February 28, 2019, we were in compliance with all terms and conditions of our credit facility, which matures on August 11, 2020, and have cash on hand in excess of 2.9 times our current outstanding debt level.Declining financial market conditions and continued decline in long-term interest rates could adversely impact the funded status of our pension plan.We maintain a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (the “Pension Plan”) covering approximately 17% of our employees.  Included in our financial results are Pension Plan costs that are measured using actuarial valuations.  The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results.  In addition, as our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels.  A decline in long-term debt interest rates puts downward pressure on the discount rate used by plan sponsors to determine their pension liabilities.  Each 10 basis point change in the discount rate impacts our computed pension liability by about $900,000.  Similar to fluctuations in market values, a drop in the discount rate could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability and future contribution levels.  Also, continued changes in the mortality tables could potentially impact our funded status.  As of February 28, 2019, the Pension Plan was 101.0% funded on a projected benefit obligation (PBO) basis and 109.4% on an accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) basis.7We may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire. We have evaluated, and may continue to evaluate, potential acquisition transactions.  We attempt to address the potential risks inherent in assessing the attractiveness of acquisition candidates, as well as other challenges such as retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire.  Integrating acquired operations involves significant risks and uncertainties, including maintenance of uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures; diversion of management’s attention from normal business operations during the integration process; unplanned expenses associated with integration efforts; and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence, including legal contingencies.  Due to these risks and others, there can be no guarantee that the businesses we acquire will lead to the cost savings or increases in net sales that we expect or desire.  Additionally, there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future, which could harm our business plan.We may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future.When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable tangible assets acquired.  The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment.  An impairment may be caused by any number of factors outside our control, such as a decline in market conditions caused by a recession, or protracted recovery there-from, or other factors like competitor’s pricing strategies, which may be tied to such economic events.  To date, we have not been required to take an impairment charge relating to our print business, but continued sale-side pressures due to technology transference, competitor pricing pressures, and economic uncertainties could result in a determination that a portion of the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets may be required to be written down. Although such a charge would be a noncash expense, it would impact our reported operating results and financial position. The Company has mitigated some of this risk by changing from indefinite lives to definite lives accounting for all intangibles assets.  Under definite lives accounting, the value of intangible assets is gradually amortized over time, instead of being left on the Company’s books in full and only being written down when an impairment event is deemed to have occurred.  At February 28, 2019, our consolidated goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $81.6 million and $61.3 million, respectively.Digital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.The increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipment combined with our customers’ general preference, as well as governmental influences for paperless business environments will continue to reduce the number of traditional printed documents sold.  Moreover, the documents that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain less value-added print content.Many of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processes and facilitate the flow of information.  These applications will increasingly be conducted over the internet or through other electronic payment systems.  The predominant method of our customers’ communication to their customers is by printed information.  As their customers become more accepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for what is perceived to be less costly electronic option, which would reduce our revenue.  The pace of these trends is difficult to predict.  These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents and require us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue which could place pressure on our operating margins.  In response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, and we are unable to increase our market share, our sales and profits will be affected.  Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins or impact the value of our recorded goodwill and intangible assets. This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.Our distributor customers may be acquired by other manufacturers who redirect business within their plants.Some of our customers are being absorbed by the distribution channels of some of our manufacturing competitors.  However, we do not believe this will significantly impact our business model.  We have continued to 8sell to some of these customers even after they were absorbed by our competition because of the breadth of our product line and our geographic diversity.  Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supply superstores.

There is no effective market of derivative instruments to insulate us against unexpected changes in price of paper in a cost-effective manner, and negotiated purchase contracts provide only limited protection against price increases.  Generally, when paper prices are increased, we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers.  In the price-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, we may not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs.  As such, any significant increase in the price of paper or shortages in its availability, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  During the last fiscal year, paper prices experienced increases due to higher pulp prices, reduced domestic capacity (which has been caused by capacity being taken off-line (planned or unplanned) or transferred to different paper types) and fewer imports due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar during the latter part of fiscal 2018 and first half of fiscal 2019.  Fewer imports and less domestic capacity generally allowed domestic paper suppliers to pass along multiple price increases during the last fiscal year and, in some cases, to impose allocation restrictions on certain paper grades.  This put significant pressure on many manufacturer’s operating margins.  Recently, with a strengthening U.S. dollar, foreign imports generally have increased to meet domestic demand.  Increasing imports, coupled with weaker domestic demand, has historically meant downward pressure on paper pricing.  It is difficult to project future pricing, however, which may be affected by many factors, including recent changes in ownership at a number of major mills.9We face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.Our marketing strategy is to differentiate ourselves by providing quality service and quality products to our customers.  Even if this strategy is successful, the results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors’ pricing strategies or other micro or macro-economic factors.  We face the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling its products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in stressed economic times.Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results. We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards, concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal, and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.We are subject to taxation related risks. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are applied.  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"").

Although we maintain employment agreements with these individuals, it cannot be assured that the services of such individuals will continue.If our internal controls are found to be ineffective, our financial results or our stock price could be adversely affected.We believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place.  However, increased risk of internal control breakdowns generally exists in a business environment that is decentralized.  In addition, if our internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which may adversely affect our stock price.Our services depend on the reliability of computer systems we and our vendors maintain.  If these systems fail, our operations may be adversely affected.We depend on information technology and data processing systems to operate our business, and a significant malfunction or disruption in the operation of our systems may disrupt our business and adversely affect our ability to operate and compete in the markets we serve.  These systems include systems that we own and operate, as well as systems of our vendors.  Such systems are susceptible to malfunctions and interruptions.  We also periodically upgrade and install new systems, which if installed or programmed incorrectly, may cause significant disruptions.  The disruptions could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may suffer a data breach of sensitive information, which may result in significant costs to investigate and remediate the breach, litigation expenses and government enforcement actions and penalties, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and reputation.It is critically important for us to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems, software and solutions.  Many of our clients provide us with information they consider confidential or sensitive, and many of our client’s industries have established standards for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information relating to their businesses and customers.  Confidential and sensitive information stored in our systems or available through web portals are susceptible to cybercrime or intentional disruption, which generally have increased across all industries in terms of sophistication and frequency.  Disclosure of confidential information maintained on our systems or available through web portals due to human error, breach of our systems through cybercrime, a leak of confidential information due to employee misconduct or similar events may damage our reputation, subject us to regulatory enforcement action and cause significant reputational harm for our clients.  Any of these outcomes may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.Our expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant.  Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.  Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system.  While the Company has various cost controls measures in place and employs an outside oversight review on larger claims, employee health benefits have been and are expected to continue to be a significant cost to the Company.  During fiscal year 2017, the Company incurred a significant increase to its medical costs which was in excess of the increase that was anticipated.  As such, effective with the start of calendar year 2017, the Company made significant changes to its medical reimbursement program.  The program to date has not only been extremely successful in stemming the increasing tide associated with medical costs to the Company, but has reduced the trend line down to be more in line with historical levels.  Even so, medical costs are and will continue to be a significant expense to the Company and subject to increases outside the Company’s control.11"

In such an event,our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, andcompetitors pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.     Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions,but also by local market conditions, and competitors pricing strategies, which can varysubstantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may promptpromotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibilityor result in charges. Certain macroeconomic events, such as the recent crisis in the financialmarkets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment,which could also adversely affect us. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainlyon the following:  Our ability to manage upward pressure on commodity prices and the impact ofgovernment actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending,inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the current volatility inthe global financial markets;   The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model,the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potentialimpact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturingfacilities.Declining economic conditions could negatively impact our business.     Our operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. Markets inthe United States and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption due inpart to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system and the financialmarkets generally. The consequences of a potential or prolonged recession may include a lower levelof economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets.A lower level of economic activity might result in a decline in demand for our products, which mayadversely affect our revenues and future growth. Instability in the financial markets, as a resultof recession or otherwise, also may affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise capital.6Table of ContentsThe terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations. Wemay not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, for proposed expansion projects.     The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our ability toincur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquisitions, asset dispositions, as well asother customary covenants, such as minimum equity level and total funded debt to EBITDA, asdefined. Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,such as distressed and volatile financial markets which could trigger an impairment charge to ourrecorded intangible assets. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under ourcredit facility. In the event of a default, the bank could elect to declare the outstandingprincipal amount of our credit facility, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable underour credit facility to be immediately due and payable. As of February 28, 2011, we were incompliance with all terms and conditions of our credit facility, which matures on August 18, 2012.Declining financial market conditions could adversely impact the funding status of our pensionplan.     We maintain a defined-benefit pension plan covering approximately 11% of our employees.Included in our financial results are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations.The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results. In addition, as our pension assetsare invested in marketable securities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentiallynegatively impact our funding status, recorded pension liability, and future required minimumcontribution levels.We may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets which could cause ourfinancial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future.     When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may beallocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase pricewhich is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price overthe net identifiable tangible assets acquired. The annual impairment test is based on severalfactors requiring judgment. A decline in market conditions may indicate potential impairment ofgoodwill. An impairment test was completed for our fiscal year February 28, 2011, and we concludedthat no impairment charge was necessary. At February 28, 2011, our goodwill and other intangibleassets were approximately $117.3 million and $76.3 million, respectively.Digital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.     The increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipmentcombined with our customers general preference, as well as governmental influences, for paperlessbusiness environments will continue to reduce the number of printed documents sold. Moreover, thedocuments that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain lessvalue-added print content.     Many of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processesand facilitate the flow of information. These applications will increasingly be conducted over theinternet or through other electronic payment systems. The predominant method of our clientscommunication to their customers is by printed information. As their customers become moreaccepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for the less costlyelectronic option, which would reduce our revenue. The pace of these trends is difficult topredict. These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents andrequire us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue.     In response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue todevelop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities andnew product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized businessforms products, and we arent able to increase our market share, our sales and profits will beaffected. Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and products due to obsolescencecould also reduce our gross margins. This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits,unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products andservices or realize cost savings in other areas.Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supplysuperstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives inorder to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.     Low price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks andrelated products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many ofthese products at competitive prices.7Table of ContentsThese superstores also offer the convenience of one-stopshopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition,superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts toexpand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order toenable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.Technological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over some of our competitors, whichcould reduce our profits.     Improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling some of ourcompetitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs.Increased competition from these competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order toattract and retain customers, which could reduce our profits.We could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.     As of February 28, 2011, approximately 15% of our domestic employees are represented by laborunions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiations. Fourunions represent all of our hourly employees in Mexico. While we feel we have a good workingrelationship with all the unions, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations willprove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may breakdown and result in the disruption of our business or operations.We obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption in ourrelationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials ormaterial shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.     Cotton yarn is the primary raw material used in Alstyles manufacturing processes. Cottonaccounts for approximately 35% of the manufactured product cost. Alstyle acquires its yarn fromthree major sources that meet stringent quality and on-time delivery requirements. The largestsupplier provided 75% of Alstyles yarn requirements during the year and has an entire yarn milldedicated to Alstyles production. To maintain our high standard of color control associated withour apparel products, we purchase our dyeing chemicals from limited sources. If Alstylesrelations with its suppliers are disrupted, Alstyle may not be able to enter into arrangements withsubstitute suppliers on terms as favorable as its current terms, and our results of operationscould be materially adversely affected.     We also purchase our paper products from a limited number of sources, which meet stringentquality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts. However, fluctuations in thequality of our paper, unexpected price increases or other factors that relate to our paper productscould have a material adverse effect on our operating results.     Both cotton and paper are commodities that are subject to periodic increases or decreases inprice, sometimes quite significant. There is no effective market to cost-effectively insulate usagainst unexpected changes in price of paper, and corporate negotiated purchase contracts provideonly limited protection against price increases. We generally acquire our cotton yarn undershort-term purchase contracts with our suppliers. While we generally do not use derivativeinstruments, including cotton option contracts, to manage our exposure to movements in cottonmarket prices, we believe we are competitive with other companies in the United States apparelindustry in negotiating the price of cotton. During the previous fiscal year, spot cotton pricesincreased significantly , however, manufacturers were able to insulate themselves from some ofthese increases with forward purchase contracts. However, because spot cotton prices have remainedat these levels for a sustained period of time, most of these favorable forward contracts haveexpired and higher cotton costs are starting to impact all manufacturers inventory costs. Whencotton or paper prices are increased, we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the pricesof our products to our customers. In the price-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, wemay not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs. As such, any significantincrease in the price of paper or cotton or shortages in the availability of either, could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations.We face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sellsubstantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.     Demand for Alstyles products is dependent on the general demand for shirts and theavailability of alternative sources of supply. Alstyles strategy in this market environment is tobe a low cost producer and to differentiate itself by providing quality service and qualityproducts to its customers. Even if this strategy is successful, its resultsmay be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors pricingstrategies. Our Print Segment8Table of Contentsalso faces the risk of our competition following a strategy ofselling their products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially indistressed economic times.The apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.     The apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionaryconsumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditionschange. These include, but are not limited to, employment levels, energy costs, interest rates,tax rates, personal debt levels, and uncertainty about the future. Any deterioration in generaleconomic conditions that creates uncertainty or alters discretionary consumer spending habits couldreduce our sales, increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify ourcurrent business practices, and consequently negatively impact our results of operations.Our apparel foreign operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements,tariffs and other market barriers, political and economic instability, and social unrest in thecountries where it operates, which could negatively impact our operating results.     Alstyle operates manufacturing facilities in Mexico and sources certain product manufacturingand purchases from El Salvador, Thailand, India, Pakistan and China. Alstyles foreign operationscould be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other marketbarriers, political and economic instability and social unrest in the countries where it operates.The impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject Alstyle to additionalcosts or loss of sales, which could adversely affect our operating results. In particular, Alstyleoperates its facilities in Mexico pursuant to the maquiladora duty-free program established bythe Mexican and United States governments. This program enables Alstyle to take advantage ofgenerally lower costs in Mexico, without paying duty on inventory shipped into or out of Mexico.There can be no assurance that the governments of Mexico and the United States will continue theprogram currently in place or that Alstyle will continue to be able to benefit from this program.The loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.     In addition, after the transition of its manufacturing operations in Anaheim, CA to Agua Prieta,MX, all Alstyles knit and dye operations will be located in one facility. Any disruptions inoperations through any of the above factors, as well as others, could have a material adverseeffect on the Companys operational results.Our apparel products are subject to foreign competition, which in the past have been faced withsignificant U.S. government import restrictions.     Foreign producers of apparel often have significant labor cost advantages. Given the number ofthese foreign producers, the substantial elimination of import protections that protect domesticapparel producers could materially adversely affect Alstyles business. The extent of importprotection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been, and is likely to remain, subject toconsiderable political considerations.     The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) became effective on January 1, 1994 and hascreated a free-trade zone among Canada, Mexico, and the United States. NAFTA contains a rule oforigin requirement that products be produced in one of the three countries in order to benefit fromthe agreement. NAFTA has phased out all trade restrictions and tariffs among the three countries onapparel products competitive with those of Alstyle. Alstyle performs substantially all of itscutting and sewing in six plants located in Mexico in order to take advantage of the NAFTAbenefits. It will be manufacturing all its products in Mexico, once the transition from itsmanufacturing plant in Anaheim, CA to Agua Prieta, Mexico is completed this fiscal year. Subsequentrepeal or alteration of NAFTA could adversely affect our business.     The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) became effective May 28, 2004 andretroactive to January 1, 2004 for textiles and apparel. It creates a free trade zone similar toNAFTA by and between the United States and Central American countries (El Salvador, Honduras, CostaRica, Nicaragua, and Dominican Republic.) Textiles and apparel are duty-free and quota-freeimmediately if they meet the agreements rule of origin, promoting new opportunities for U.S. andCentral American fiber, yarn, fabric and apparel manufacturing. The agreement gives duty-freebenefits to some apparel made in Central America that contains certain fabrics from NAFTA partnersMexico and Canada. Alstyle outsourced approximately 16% of its sewing to contract manufacturers inEl Salvador during the year, and we do not anticipate that alteration or subsequent repeal of CAFTAwould have a material effect on our operations.     The World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trade organization, was formed in January1995 and is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This multilateraltrade organization has set forth mechanisms by which world trade in clothing is being progressivelyliberalized by phasing-out quotas and reducing9Table of Contentsduties over a period of time that began in Januaryof 1995. As it implements the WTO mechanisms, the United States government is negotiatingbilateral trade agreements with developing countries, which are generally exporters of textile andapparel products, that are members of the WTO to get them to reduce their tariffs on imports oftextiles and apparel in exchange for reductions by the United States in tariffs on imports oftextiles and apparel.     In January 2005, United States import quotas were removed on knitted shirts from China. Theelimination of quotas and the reduction of tariffs under the WTO may result in increased imports ofcertain apparel products into North America. In May 2005, quotas on three categories of clothingimports, including knitted shirts, from China were re-imposed. A reduction of import quotas andtariffs could make Alstyles products less competitive against low cost imports from developingcountries.Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results.     We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulationsestablishing health and environmental quality standards, and may be subject to liability orpenalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governingremediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or towhich we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may besubject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretationsof existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the futureif we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or atfacilities we may acquire.     Our new apparel manufacturing facility in Mexico is subject to certain risks regarding salesgrowth and cost savings, as well as transition risks associated with moving the current production.     Our new manufacturing facility is being built to capture anticipated future growth and savingsin production costs over our current cost structure in Anaheim, CA. In conjunction with thecompletion of this new facility in Agua Prieta, Mexico, we will be transitioning our current knitand dye manufacturing capacity from Anaheim, CA to Agua Prieta, Mexico. Should such growth orproduction savings not materialize, or should the timeline for our transition from Anaheim, CA toAgua Prieta, Mexico be delayed, such events may impact our ability to achieve our expected returnand/or could negatively impact our operational results and financial condition.We are exposed to the risk of non-payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales.     Our extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of eachcustomers financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure byperiodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers. We saw a heightenedamount of bankruptcies by our customers, especially retailers, during the recent economic downturn.While we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon ourhistorical trends and other available information, in times of economic turmoil, there isheightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate. The inability tocollect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations.Our business incurs significant freight and transportation costs.     We incur significant freight costs to transport our goods, especially as it relates to ourApparel Segment where we transport our product from our domestic textile plant to foreign sewingfacilities and then to bring our goods back into the United States. In addition, we incurtransportation expenses to ship our products to our customers. Significant increases in the costsof freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, asthere can be no assurance that we could pass these increased costs to our customers.The price of energy is prone to significant fluctuations and volatility.     Our apparel manufacturing operations require high inputs of energy, and therefore changes inenergy prices directly impact our gross profit margins. We are focusing on manufacturing methodsthat will reduce the amount of energy used in the production of our apparel products to mitigatethe rising costs of energy. Significant increases in energy prices could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that wecould pass these increased costs to our customers, given the competitive environment in whichour Apparel segment operates.10Table of ContentsWe rely on independent contract production for a portion of our apparel production.     We have historically relied on third party suppliers to provide a portion of our cut and sewapparel production. During the current year, approximately 16% of our production was provided bythe third party suppliers. While we feel this risk has been and will continue to be mitigated overtime as our new manufacturing facility in Agua Prieta, Mexico comes on line, any shortage ofsupply, production disruptions, shipping delays, regulatory changes, significant price increasesfrom our suppliers, in the short-term, could adversely affect our apparel operating results.We depend upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals, many of whom wouldbe difficult to replace.     The loss or interruption of the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Executive VicePresident, Vice President of Apparel or Chief Financial Officer could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we maintainemployment agreements with these individuals, it cannot be assured that the services of suchindividuals will continue.Increases in the cost of employee benefits could impact the Companys financial results and cashflow.     The Companys expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorablechanges in the cost of such benefits could impact the Companys financial results and cash flow.Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and privatesector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S.healthcare system. The Company is not able at this time to determine the impact that healthcarereform could have on the Company-sponsored medical plans"
14,EBF,ENNIS INC,2010-05-10,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORS     You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other informationincluded or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making aninvestment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face in ourbusiness. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believeto be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, ourbusiness, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event,our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, andcompetitors pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.     Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions,but also by local market conditions, and competitors pricing strategies, which can varysubstantially by market. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may promptpromotional or other actions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibilityor result in charges. Certain macroeconomic events, such as the recent crisis in the financialmarkets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment,which could also adversely affect us. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainlyon the following:  Our ability to manage upward pressure on commodity prices and the impact ofgovernment actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending,inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the current volatility inthe global financial markets;   The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model,the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potentialimpact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturingfacilities.Declining economic conditions could negatively impact our business.     Our operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. Markets inthe United States and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption due inpart to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system and the financialmarkets generally. The consequences of a potential or prolonged recession may include a lower levelof economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets.A lower level of economic activity might result in a decline in demand for our products, which mayadversely affect our revenues and future growth. Instability in the financial markets, as a resultof recession or otherwise, also may affect our cost of capital and our ability to raise capital.     We have significant amounts of cash that are in excess of federally insured limits. With thecurrent financial environment and the instability of financial institutions, we cannot be assuredthat we will not experience losses on our deposits.6Table of ContentsThe terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations. Wemay not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, for proposed expansion projects.     The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our ability toincur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquisitions, asset dispositions, as well asother customary covenants, such as minimum equity level and total funded debt to EBITDA, asdefined. Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,such as distressed and volatile financial markets which could trigger an impairment charge to ourrecorded intangible assets. In fiscal year 2009, we were required to write down goodwill and otherintangible assets, and we may have similar charges in the future, which could cause our financialcondition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future. A breach of any ofthese covenants could result in a default under our credit facility. In the event of a default,the bank could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility, allinterest thereon, and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due andpayable. As of February 28, 2010, we were in compliance with all terms and conditions of ourcredit facility, which matures on August 18, 2012.     We may be required to borrow under our credit facility to provide financing for our newmanufacturing facility in Agua Prieta in the state of Sonora, Mexico. Our ability to access thisfacility for these funds will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affectedby prevailing economic, financial and business conditions and other factors, some of which arebeyond our control. In the event that we arent able to access the facility for the funds neededand require additional capital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise suchcapital when needed or at all.Declining financial market conditions could adversely impact the funding status of our pensionplan.     Wemaintain a defined-benefit pension plan covering approximately 14% ofour employees. Included in our financialresults are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The actuarial assumptionsused may differ from actual results. In addition, as our pension assets are invested in marketablesecurities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our fundingstatus, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels.In fiscal year 2009, we were required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets and we mayhave similar charges in the future, which could cause our financial condition and results ofoperations to be negatively affected in the future.     When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may beallocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase pricewhich is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price overthe net identifiable tangible assets acquired. The annual impairment test is based on severalfactors requiring judgment. A decline in market conditions may indicate potential impairment ofgoodwill. In fiscal year 2009, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $63.2 million and $4.7million to goodwill and trademarks, respectively. At February 28, 2010, our goodwill and otherintangible assets were approximately $117.3 million and $78.7 million, respectively, with noimpairment charge for fiscal year 2010 required.Digital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.     The increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipmentcombined with our customers general preference, as well as governmental influences, for paperlessbusiness environments will continue to reduce the number of printed documents sold. Moreover, thedocuments that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain lessvalue-added print content.     Many of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processesand facilitate the flow of information. These applications will increasingly be conducted over theinternet or through other electronic payment systems. The predominant method of our clientscommunication to their customers is by printed information. As their customers become moreaccepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for the less costlyelectronic option, which would reduce our revenue. The pace of these trends is difficult topredict. These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents andrequire us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue.     In response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue todevelop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities andnew product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized businessforms products, and we arent able to increase7Table of Contentsour market share, our sales and profits will be affected. Decreases in sales of ourstandardized business forms and products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins.This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset thereduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savingsin other areas.Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supplysuperstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives inorder to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.     Low price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks andrelated products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many ofthese products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of one-stopshopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition,superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts toexpand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order toenable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.Technological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over some of our competitors, whichcould reduce our profits.     Improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling some of ourcompetitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs.Increased competition from these competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order toattract and retain customers, which could reduce our profits.We could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.     As of February 28, 2010, approximately 12% of our domestic employees are represented by laborunions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiations. Twounions represent all of our hourly employees in Mexico. While we feel we have a good workingrelationship with all the unions, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations willprove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may breakdown and result in the disruption of our business or operations.We obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption in ourrelationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials ormaterial shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.     Cotton yarn is the primary raw material used in Alstyles manufacturing processes. Cottonaccounts for approximately 40% of the manufactured product cost. Alstyle acquires its yarn fromthree major sources that meet stringent quality and on-time delivery requirements. The largestsupplier provides over 75% of Alstyles yarn requirements and has an entire yarn mill dedicated toAlstyles production. To maintain our high standard of color control associated with our apparelproducts, we purchase our dyeing chemicals from limited sources. If Alstyles relations with itssuppliers are disrupted, Alstyle may not be able to enter into arrangements with substitutesuppliers on terms as favorable as its current terms, and our results of operations could bematerially adversely affected.     We also purchase our paper products from a limited number of sources, which meet stringentquality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts. However, fluctuations in thequality of our paper, unexpected price increases or other factors that relate to our paper productscould have a material adverse effect on our operating results.     Both cotton and paper are commodities that are subject to periodic increases or decreases inprice, sometimes quite significant. There is no effective market to cost-effectively insulate usagainst unexpected changes in price of paper, and corporate negotiated purchase contracts provideonly limited protection against price increases. We generally acquire our cotton yarn undershort-term purchase contracts with our suppliers. While we generally do not use derivativeinstruments, including cotton option contracts, to manage our exposure to movements in cottonmarket prices, we believe we are competitive with other companies in the United States apparelindustry in negotiating the price of cotton. When cotton or paper prices are increased, we attemptto recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers. In theprice-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, we may not always be able to pass through anyor all of the higher costs. As such, any significant increase in the price of paper or cotton orshortages in the availability of either, could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations.8Table of ContentsWe face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sellsubstantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.     Demand for Alstyles products is dependent on the general demand for shirts and theavailability of alternative sources of supply. Alstyles strategy in this market environment is tobe a low cost producer and to differentiate itself by providing quality service and qualityproducts to its customers. Even if this strategy is successful, its results may be offset byreductions in demand or price declines due to competitors pricing strategies. Our Print Segmentalso faces the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling their products at or belowcost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in distressed economic times.The apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.     The apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionaryconsumer spending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditionschange. These include, but are not limited to, employment levels, energy costs, interest rates,tax rates, personal debt levels, and uncertainty about the future. Any deterioration in generaleconomic conditions that creates uncertainty or alters discretionary consumer spending habits couldreduce our sales, increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify ourcurrent business practices, and consequently negatively impact our results of operations.Our apparel foreign operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements,tariffs and other market barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where itoperates, which could negatively impact our operating results.     Alstyle operates cutting and sewing facilities in Mexico and sources certain productmanufacturing and purchases in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Pakistan and China. Alstylesforeign operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs, andother market barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where it operates.The impact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject Alstyle to additionalcosts or loss of sales, which could adversely affect our operating results. In particular, Alstyleoperates its facilities in Mexico pursuant to the maquiladora duty-free program established bythe Mexican and United States governments. This program enables Alstyle to take advantage ofgenerally lower costs in Mexico, without paying duty on inventory shipped into or out of Mexico.There can be no assurance that the governments of Mexico and the United States will continue theprogram currently in place or that Alstyle will continue to be able to benefit from this program.The loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on our business.Our apparel products are subject to foreign competition, which in the past have been faced withsignificant U.S. government import restrictions.     Foreign producers of apparel often have significant labor cost advantages. Given the number ofthese foreign producers, the substantial elimination of import protections that protect domesticapparel producers could materially adversely affect Alstyles business. The extent of importprotection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been, and is likely to remain, subject toconsiderable political considerations.     The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) became effective on January 1, 1994 and hascreated a free-trade zone among Canada, Mexico, and the United States. NAFTA contains a rule oforigin requirement that products be produced in one of the three countries in order to benefit fromthe agreement. NAFTA has phased out all trade restrictions and tariffs among the three countries onapparel products competitive with those of Alstyle. Alstyle performs substantially all of itscutting and sewing in five plants located in Mexico in order to take advantage of the NAFTAbenefits. Subsequent repeal or alteration of NAFTA could adversely affect our business.     The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) became effective May 28, 2004 andretroactive to January 1, 2004 for textiles and apparel. It creates a free trade zone similar toNAFTA by and between the United States and Central American countries (El Salvador, Honduras, CostaRica, Nicaragua, and Dominican Republic.) Textiles and apparel are duty-free and quota-freeimmediately if they meet the agreements rule of origin, promoting new opportunities for U.S. andCentral American fiber, yarn, fabric and apparel manufacturing. The agreement gives duty-freebenefits to some apparel made in Central America that contains certain fabrics from NAFTA partnersMexico and Canada. Alstyle outsourced approximately 6% of its sewing to a contract manufacturer inEl Salvador, and we do not anticipate that alteration or subsequent repeal of CAFTA would have amaterial effect on our operations.9Table of Contents     The World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trade organization, was formed in January1995 and is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This multilateraltrade organization has set forth mechanisms by which world trade in clothing is being progressivelyliberalized by phasing-out quotas and reducing duties over a period of time that began in Januaryof 1995. As it implements the WTO mechanisms, the United States government is negotiatingbilateral trade agreements with developing countries, which are generally exporters of textile andapparel products, that are members of the WTO to get them to reduce their tariffs on imports oftextiles and apparel in exchange for reductions by the United States in tariffs on imports oftextiles and apparel.     In January 2005, United States import quotas were removed on knitted shirts from China. Theelimination of quotas and the reduction of tariffs under the WTO may result in increased imports ofcertain apparel products into North America. In May 2005, quotas on three categories of clothingimports, including knitted shirts, from China were re-imposed. A reduction of import quotas andtariffs could make Alstyles products less competitive against low cost imports from developingcountries.Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results.     We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulationsestablishing health and environmental quality standards, and may be subject to liability orpenalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governingremediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or towhich we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may besubject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretationsof existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the futureif we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or atfacilities we may acquire.Our construction of a new apparel manufacturing facility in Mexico is subject to multiple approvalsand uncertainties that could affect our ability to complete the project on schedule or at budgetedcost.     The construction of our new apparel manufacturing facility in the town of Agua Prieta in thestate of Sonora, Mexico is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2011. The construction ofthis new facility will involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legaluncertainties beyond our control. The cost of the facility and the equipment required for thefacility will require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital that will be financedthrough internal cash flows or alternatively through borrowings under our credit facility which arecontingent on us continuing to meet certain financial covenants. Moreover, this facility is beingbuilt to capture anticipated future growth in demand and anticipated savings in production costs.Should such growth or production savings not materialize, or should the timeline for our transitionbe delayed, we may be unable to achieve our expected investment return, which could adverselyaffect our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to the risk of non-payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales.     Our extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation ofeach customers financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure byperiodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers. We saw a heightenedamount of bankruptcies by our customers, especially retailers, during the recent economic downturn.While we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon ourhistorical trends and other available information, in times of economic turmoil, there isheightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate. The inability tocollect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations.Our business incurs significant freight and transportation costs.     We incur significant freight costs to transport our goods, especially as it relates to ourApparel Segment where we transport our product from our domestic textile plant to foreign sewingfacilities and then to bring our goods back into the United States. In addition, we incurtransportation expenses to ship our products to our customers. Significant increases in the costsof freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, asthere can be no assurance that we could pass these increased costs to our customers.The price of energy is prone to significant fluctuations and volatility.     Our apparel manufacturing operations require high inputs of energy, and therefore changes inenergy prices directly impact our gross profit margins. We are focusing on manufacturing methodsthat will reduce the amount of energy used in the production of our apparel products to mitigatethe rising costs of energy. Significant increases in energy prices could have a material adverseeffect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that we10Table of Contentscould pass these increased costs to our customers given the competitive environment in whichour Apparel segment operates.We rely on independent contract production for a portion of our apparel production.     We have historically relied on third party suppliers to provide approximately 10% of our cutand sew apparel production. Any shortage of supply, production disruptions, shipping delays,regulatory changes, significant price increases from our suppliers, could adversely affect ourapparel operating results.We depend upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals, many of whom wouldbe difficult to replace.     The loss or interruption of the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Executive VicePresident, Vice President of Apparel or Chief Financial Officer could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we maintainemployment agreements with these individuals, it cannot be assured that the services of suchindividuals will continue"
8,EBF,ENNIS INC,2009-05-11,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other informationincluded or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making aninvestment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face in ourbusiness. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believeto be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, ourbusiness, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event,our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.     Our results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, which canadversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.     Our results of operations are substantially affected not only by global economic conditions,but also by local operating and economic conditions, which can vary substantially by market.Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market and may prompt promotional or otheractions that adversely affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility or result incharges. Certain macroeconomic events, such as the current crisis in the financial markets, couldhave a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could alsoadversely affect us. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainly on thefollowing:  Our ability to manage upward pressure on commodity prices and the impact ofgovernment actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending,inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the current volatility inthe global financial markets;6Table of Contents  The impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model,the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potentialimpact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturingfacilities.Declining economic conditions could negatively impact our business.     Our operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. Markets inthe United States and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for morethan 12 months, due in part to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking systemand the financial markets generally. During the current quarter this volatility and disruption hasreached unprecedented levels. The consequences of a potential or prolonged recession may include alower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital andcommodity markets. A lower level of economic activity might result in a decline in demand for ourproducts, which may adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Instability in the financialmarkets, as a result of recession or otherwise, also may affect our cost of capital and our abilityto raise capital.     We have significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents that are in excess of federallyinsured limits. With the current financial environment and the instability of financialinstitutions, we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on our deposits.The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations. Wemay not be able to raise additional capital, if needed for proposed expansion projects, etc.     The terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our ability toincur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquisitions, asset dispositions, as well asother customary covenants, such as minimum equity level and total funded debt to EBITDA, asdefined. Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control,such as distressed and volatile financial markets which could trigger an impairment charge to ourrecorded intangible assets (see Risk Factors
  In 2009 we were required to write down goodwill andother intangible assets and we may have similar charges in the future, which could cause ourfinancial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future  page 7).A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility. In theevent of a default, the bank could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our creditfacility, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to beimmediately due and payable. As of February 28, 2009 we were in compliance with all terms andconditions of our credit facility, which matures on March 31, 2010.     We anticipate borrowing under our credit facility to provide financing for our new facility inAgua Prieta in the state of Sonora, Mexico. Our ability to access this facility for these fundswill depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic,financial and business conditions and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. In theevent that we arent able to access the facility for the funds needed and require additionalcapital, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or atall.Declining financial market conditions could adversely impact the funding status of our pensionplan.     We maintain a defined-benefit pension plan for our employees. Included in our financialresults are pension costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The actuarial assumptionsused may differ from actual results. In addition, as our pension assets are invested in marketablesecurities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our fundingstatus, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels, as we sawduring this past fiscal year.In 2009 we were required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets and we may have similarcharges in the future, which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to benegatively affected in the future.     When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may beallocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase priceallocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the netidentifiable assets acquired. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiringjudgment. Principally a decline in market conditions may indicate potential impairment ofgoodwill. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of$63.2 million and $4.7 million to goodwill and trademarks, respectively. At February 28, 2009, ourgoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $117.3 million and $81.1 million,respectively.7Table of ContentsPrinted business forms may be superseded over time by paperless business forms or otherwiseaffected by technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences, which could reduce oursales and profits.     Printed business forms and checks may eventually be superseded by paperless business forms,which could have a material adverse effect on our business over time. The price and performancecapabilities of personal computers and related printers now provide a cost-competitive means toprint low-quality versions of many of our business forms on plain paper. In addition, electronictransaction systems and off-the-shelf business software applications have been designed to automateseveral of the functions performed by our business form and check products. In response to thegradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability toprovide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductionsdo not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, there is arisk that the number of new customers we attract and existing customers we retain may diminish,which could reduce our sales and profits. Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms andproducts due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins. This reduction could in turnadversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introductionof new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supplysuperstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives inorder to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.     Low price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks,and related products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer manyof these products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of one-stopshopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition,superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts toexpand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order toenable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.Technological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over some of our competitors, whichcould reduce our profits.     Improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling some of ourcompetitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs.Increased competition from these competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order toattract and retain customers, which could reduce our profits.We could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.     As of February 28, 2009, approximately 12% of our domestic employees are represented by laborunions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiations. Twounions represent all of our hourly employees in Mexico. There can be no assurance that any futurelabor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost oflabor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.We obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers and any disruption in ourrelationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials,material shortages, or an increase in transportation costs, could have a material adverse effect onus.     Cotton yarn is the primary raw material used in Alstyles manufacturing processes. Cottonaccounts for approximately 40% of the manufactured product cost. Alstyle acquires its yarn fromthree major sources that meet stringent quality and on-time delivery requirements. The largestsupplier provides more than 75% of Alstyles yarn requirements and has an entire yarn milldedicated to Alstyles production. If Alstyles relations with its suppliers are disrupted, Alstylemay not be able to enter into arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as itscurrent terms and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.     Alstyle generally acquires its cotton yarn under short-term purchase orders with itssuppliers, and has exposure to swings in cotton market prices. Alstyle does not use derivativeinstruments, including cotton option contracts, to manage its exposure to movements in cottonmarket prices. Alstyle may use such derivative instruments in the future. We believe we arecompetitive with other companies in the United States apparel industry in negotiating the price ofcotton. However, any significant increase in the price of cotton or shortages in the availabilityof cotton as the result of farmers switching to alternative crops, such as corn, could have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations.8Table of Contents     Freight costs also represent a significant cost to our apparel company. We incur freight costsassociated with the delivery of yarn to our manufacturing facility in Anaheim, CA. We also incurfreight costs associated with transporting our knit and dyed products to Mexico and our final sewnproducts from Mexico to our various distribution centers. Any significant increase intransportation costs due to increased fuel costs, etc. could have a material impact on our reportedapparel margins.     We also purchase our paper products from a limited number of sources, which meet stringentquality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts. However, fluctuations in thequality of our paper, unexpected price increases, etc. could have a material adverse effect on ouroperating results.We face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sellsubstantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.     Demand for Alstyles products is dependent on the general demand for shirts and theavailability of alternative sources of supply. Alstyles strategy in this market environment is tobe a low cost producer and to differentiate itself by providing quality service and qualityproducts to its customers. Even if this strategy is successful, its results may be offset byreductions in demand or price declines due to competitors pricing strategies. Our Print Segmentalso faces the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling their products at or belowcost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in distressed economic times.The apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles.     The apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumerspending, which changes as regional, domestic and international economic conditions change. Theseinclude, but are not limited to, employment levels, energy costs, interest rates, tax rates,personal debt levels, and uncertainty about the future. Anydeterioration in general economic conditions that creates uncertainty or alters discretionaryconsumer spending habits could reduce our sales, increase our costs of goods sold or require us tosignificantly modify our current business practices, and consequently negatively impact our resultsof operations.Our apparel foreign operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements,tariffs and other market barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where itoperates, which could negatively impact our operating results.     Alstyle operates cutting and sewing facilities in Mexico, and sources certain productmanufacturing and purchases in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Pakistan, China, and SoutheastAsia. Alstyles foreign operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatoryrequirements, tariffs, and other market barriers and political and economic instability in thecountries where it operates. The impact of any such events that may occur in the future couldsubject Alstyle to additional costs or loss of sales, which could adversely affect our operatingresults. In particular, Alstyle operates its facilities in Mexico pursuant to the maquiladoraduty-free program established by the Mexican and United States governments. This program enablesAlstyle to take advantage of generally lower costs in Mexico, without paying duty on inventoryshipped into or out of Mexico. There can be no assurance that the governments of Mexico and theUnited States will continue the program currently in place or that Alstyle will continue to be ableto benefit from this program. The loss of these benefits could have an adverse effect on ourbusiness.Our apparel products are subject to foreign competition, which in the past has been faced withsignificant U.S. government import restrictions.     Foreign producers of apparel often have significant labor cost advantages. Given the number ofthese foreign producers, the substantial elimination of import protections that protect domesticapparel producers could materially adversely affect Alstyles business. The extent of importprotection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been, and is likely to remain, subject toconsiderable political considerations.     The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) became effective on January 1, 1994 and hascreated a free-trade zone among Canada, Mexico, and the United States. NAFTA contains a rule oforigin requirement that products be produced in one of the three countries in order to benefit fromthe agreement. NAFTA has phased out all trade restrictions and tariffs among the three countries onapparel products competitive with those of Alstyle. Alstyle performs substantially all of its cutting and sewing in five plants located in Mexico in orderto take advantage of the NAFTA benefits. Subsequent repeal or alteration of NAFTA could adverselyaffect our business.9Table of Contents     The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) became effective May 28, 2004 andretroactive to January 1, 2004 for textiles and apparel. It creates a free trade zone similar toNAFTA by and between the United States and Central American countries (El Salvador, Honduras, CostaRica, Nicaragua, and Dominican Republic.) Textiles and apparel are duty-free and quota-freeimmediately if they meet the agreements rule of origin, promoting new opportunities for U.S. andCentral American fiber, yarn, fabric and apparel manufacturing. The agreement gives duty-freebenefits to some apparel made in Central America that contains certain fabrics from NAFTA partnersMexico and Canada. Alstyle sources approximately 20% of its sewing to a contract manufacturer in ElSalvador, and we do not anticipate that alteration or subsequent repeal of CAFTA would have amaterial effect on our operations.     The World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trade organization, was formed in January1995 and is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This multilateraltrade organization has set forth mechanisms by which world trade in clothing is being progressivelyliberalized by phasing-out quotas and reducing duties over a period of time that began in Januaryof 1995. As it implements the WTO mechanisms, the United States government is negotiating bilateraltrade agreements with developing countries, which are generally exporters of textile and apparelproducts, that are members of the WTO to get them to reduce their tariffs on imports of textilesand apparel in exchange for reductions by the United States in tariffs on imports of textiles andapparel.     In January 2005, United States import quotas have been removed on knitted shirts from China.The elimination of quotas and the reduction of tariffs under the WTO may result in increasedimports of certain apparel products into North America. In May 2005, quotas on three categories ofclothing imports, including knitted shirts, from China were re-imposed. A reduction of importquotas and tariffs could make Alstyles products less competitive against low cost imports fromdeveloping countries.Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results.     We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and foreign laws and regulationsestablishing health and environmental quality standards, and may be subject to liability orpenalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governingremediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or towhich we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may besubject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretationsof existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the futureif we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or atfacilities we may acquire.Our planned expansion of facilities is subject to multiple approvals and uncertainties that couldaffect our ability to complete the project on schedule or at budgeted cost.     On June 26, 2008, we announced plans to build a new apparel manufacturing facility in the townof Agua Prieta in the state of Sonora, Mexico. The construction of this new facility will involvenumerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties beyond our control. Thecost of the facility and the equipment required for the facility will require the expenditure ofsignificant amounts of capital that will be required to be financed through internal cash flows oralternatively additional debt, which given the current financial environment there can be noassurances that such funds will be available. Moreover, this facility is being built to captureanticipated future growth in demand and anticipated savings in production costs. Should such growthor production savings not materialize, or should the timeline for our transition be delayed, we maybe unable to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.We are exposed to the risk of financial non-performance by our customers on a significant amount ofour sales.     Our extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of eachcustomers financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure byperiodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers. Recently we haveseen a heightened amount of bankruptcies in our customers, especially retailers, and we believethis trend may continue given the current economic environment. We maintain an allowance fordoubtful accounts for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other availableinformation. However, the inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group ofcustomers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Our business incurs significant freight and transportation costs.     We incur significant freight costs to transport our goods, especially as it relates to ourApparel segment where we transport our product from our domestic textile plant to off-shore sewingfacilities and then to bring our goods back into the United States. In addition, we incurtransportation expenses to ship our products to our customers.10Table of ContentsTransportation costs have increased significantly during fiscal year 2008 and 2009, and, accordingly, had an unfavorable impact on ourresults of operations.

Under current accounting standards,if we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to write down thevalue of these assets. Annually, we have conducted a review of our goodwill and other identifiableintangible assets to determine whether there has been impairment. We cannot provide assurance thatwe will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.

Given the number ofthese foreign producers, the substantial elimination of import protections that protect domesticapparel producers could materially adversely affect Alstyles business. The extent of importprotection afforded to domestic apparel producers has been, and is likely to remain, subject toconsiderable political considerations.     The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) became effective on January 1, 1994 and hascreated a free-trade zone among Canada, Mexico, and the United States. NAFTA contains a rule oforigin requirement that products be produced in one of the three countries in order to benefit fromthe agreement. NAFTA has phased out all trade restrictions and tariffs among the three countries onapparel products competitive with those of Alstyle. Alstyle performs substantially all of itscutting and sewing in five plants located in Mexico in order to take advantage of the NAFTAbenefits. Subsequent repeal or alteration of NAFTA could adversely affect our business.     The Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) became effective May 28, 2004 andretroactive to January 1, 2004 for textiles and apparel. It creates a free trade zone similar toNAFTA by and between the United States and Central American countries (El Salvador, Honduras, CostaRica, Nicaragua, and Dominican Republic.) Textiles and apparel will be duty-free and quota-freeimmediately if they meet the agreements rule of origin, promoting new opportunities for U.S. andCentral American fiber, yarn, fabric and apparel manufacturing. The agreement will also giveduty-free benefits to some apparel made in Central America that contains certain fabrics from NAFTApartners Mexico and Canada. Alstyle sources approximately 20% of its sewing to a contractmanufacturer in El Salvador, and we do not anticipate that this will have a material effect on ouroperations.     The World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trade organization, was formed in January1995 and is the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This multilateraltrade organization has set forth mechanisms by which world trade in clothing is being progressivelyliberalized by phasing-out quotas and reducing duties over a period of time that began in Januaryof 1995. As it implements the WTO mechanisms, the United States government is negotiating bilateraltrade agreements with developing countries, which are generally exporters of textile and apparelproducts, that are members of the WTO to get them to reduce their tariffs on imports of textilesand apparel in exchange for reductions by the United States in tariffs on imports of textiles andapparel.9Table of Contents     In January 2005, United States import quotas have been removed on knitted shirts from China.The elimination of quotas and the reduction of tariffs under the WTO may result in increasedimports of certain apparel products into North America. In May 2005, quotas on three categories ofclothing imports, including knitted shirts, from China were re-imposed. A reduction of importquotas and tariffs could make Alstyles products less competitive against low cost imports fromdeveloping countries.Environmental regulations may impact our future operating results.     We are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and foreign laws and regulationsestablishing health and environmental quality standards, and may be subject to liability orpenalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governingremediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or towhich we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may besubject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretationsof existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the futureif we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or atfacilities we may acquire.We depend upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals, many of whom wouldbe difficult to replace.     The loss or interruption of the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Executive VicePresident, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President Apparel Division, could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

RISK FACTORS     You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other informationincluded or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making aninvestment in the Companys common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we facein our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currentlybelieve to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risksoccur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In suchan event, our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.We may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets in the future, which couldcause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future.     When weacquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may beallocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase priceallocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the netidentifiable assets acquired. At February 28, 2007, our goodwill and other intangible assets wereapproximately $178.3 million and $83.3 million, respectively. Under current accounting standards,if we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to write down thevalue of these assets. Annually, we have conducted a review of our goodwill and other identifiableintangible assets to determine whether there has been impairment. Such a review was completed forour fiscal year ended February 28, 2007, and we concluded that no impairment charge was necessary.We cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in thefuture. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our shareholders equity andfinancial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.Printed business forms may be superceded over time by paperless business forms or otherwiseaffected by technological obsolescence and changing customer preferences, which could reduce oursales and profits.     Printed business forms and checks may eventually be superceded by paperless business forms,which could have a material adverse effect on our business over time. The price and performancecapabilities of personal computers and related printers now provide a cost-competitive means toprint low-quality versions of many of our business forms on plain paper. In addition, electronictransaction systems and off-the-shelf business software applications have been designed to automateseveral of the functions performed by our business form and check products. In response to thegradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability toprovide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductionsdo not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, there is arisk that the number of new customers we attract and existing customers we retain may diminish,which could reduce our sales and profits. Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms andproducts due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins. This reduction could in turnadversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introductionof new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.Our distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supplysuperstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives inorder to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.     Low price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks andrelated products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many ofthese products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of one-stopshopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition,superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional discounts toexpand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order toenable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.7Table of ContentsTechnological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over some of our competitors, whichcould reduce our profits.     Improvements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling some of ourcompetitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs.Increased competition from these competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order toattract and retain customers, which could reduce our profits.We could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.     As of February 28, 2007, approximately 14% of our domestic employees are represented by laborunions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic renegotiations. Twounions represent all of our hourly employees in Mexico. There can be no assurance that any futurelabor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost oflabor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.We obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers and any disruption in ourrelationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials,material shortages, or an increase in transportation costs, could have a material adverse effect onus.     Cotton yarn is the primary raw material used in Alstyles manufacturing processes. Cottonaccounts for approximately 40% of the manufactured product cost. Alstyle acquires its yarn fromfive major sources that meet stringent quality and on-time delivery requirements. The largestsupplier provides over 70% of Alstyles yarn requirements and has an entire yarn mill dedicated toAlstyles production. If Alstyles relations with its suppliers are disrupted, Alstyle may not beable to enter into arrangements with substitute suppliers on terms as favorable as its currentterms and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.     Alstyle generally acquires its cotton yarn under short-term purchase orders with itssuppliers, and has exposure to swings in cotton market prices. Alstyle does not use derivativeinstruments, including cotton option contracts, to manage its exposure to movements in cottonmarket prices. Alstyle may use such derivative instruments in the future. We believe we arecompetitive with other companies in the United States apparel industry in negotiating the price ofcotton. However, any significant increase in the price of cotton or shortages in the availabilityof cotton as the result of farmers switching to alternative crops, such as corn, could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations.     Freightcosts also represent a significant cost to our apparel company. We incur freightcosts associated with the delivery of yarn to our manufacturing facility in Anaheim, CA. We alsoincur freight costs associated with transporting our knit and dyed products to Mexico and our finalsewn products from Mexico to our various distribution centers. Any significant increase intransportation costs due to increased fuel costs, etc. could have a material impact on our reportedapparel margins.     We also purchase our paper products from a limited number of sources, which meet stringentquality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts. However, fluctuations in thequality of our paper, unexpected prices increases, or material shortages, etc. could have amaterial adverse effect on our operating results.Alstyle faces intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sellsubstantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.     Demand for Alstyles products is dependent on the general demand for shirts and theavailability of alternative sources of supply. Alstyles strategy in this market environment is tobe a low cost producer and to differentiate itself by providing quality service to its customers.Even if this strategy is successful, its results may be offset by reductions in demand or pricedeclines.8Table of ContentsApparel business is subject to cyclical trends.     The United States apparel industry is sensitive to the business cycle of the national economy.Moreover, the popularity, supply and demand for particular apparel products can changesignificantly from year to year. Alstyle may be unable to compete successfully in any industrydownturn due to excess capacity.Our apparel foreign operations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements,tariffs and other market barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where itoperates, which could negatively impact our operating results.     Alstyle operates cutting and sewing facilities in Mexico, and sources certain productmanufacturing and purchases in El Salvador, Pakistan, China and Southeast Asia. Alstyles foreignoperations could be subject to unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and othermarket barriers and political and economic instability in the countries where it operates. Theimpact of any such events that may occur in the future could subject Alstyle to additional costs orloss of sales, which could adversely affect our operating results. In particular, Alstyle operatesits facilities in Mexico pursuant to the maquiladora duty-free program established by the Mexicanand United States governments. This program enables Alstyle to take advantage of generally lowercosts in Mexico, without paying duty on inventory shipped into or out of Mexico. There can be noassurance that the governments of Mexico and the United States will continue the program currentlyin place or that Alstyle will continue to be able to benefit from this program.
