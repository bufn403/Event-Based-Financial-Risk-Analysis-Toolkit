Business Graham Corporation (""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" or the ""Company"") is a global leader in the design and manufacture of mission critical fluid, power, heat transfer and vacuum technologies for the defense, space, energy and process industries.  For the defense industry, our equipment is used in nuclear and non-nuclear propulsion, power, fluid transfer, and thermal management systems.  For the space industry our equipment is used in propulsion, power and energy management systems and for life support systems.  We supply equipment for vacuum, heat transfer and fluid transfer applications used in energy and new energy markets including oil refining, cogeneration, and multiple alternative and clean power applications including hydrogen.  For the chemical and petrochemical industries, our heat transfer equipment is used in fertilizer, ethylene, methanol and downstream chemical facilities. Our corporate headquarters is located with our production facilities in Batavia, New York, where surface condensers and ejectors are designed, engineered, and manufactured.  Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Barber-Nichols, LLC (""BN""), based in Arvada, Colorado, designs, develops and manufactures specialty turbomachinery products for the aerospace, cryogenic, defense and energy markets (see ""Acquisition"" below).  We also have wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, Graham Vacuum and Heat Transfer Technology Co., Ltd. (""GVHTT""), located in Suzhou, China and Graham India Private Limited (""GIPL""), located in Ahmedabad, India.  GVHTT provides sales and engineering support for us in the People's Republic of China and management oversight throughout Southeast Asia. GIPL serves as a sales and market development office focusing on the refining, petrochemical and fertilizer markets in India and the Middle East. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1983 and are the successor to Graham Manufacturing Co., Inc., which was incorporated in New York in 1936.  Our stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ""GHM"". Our fiscal year ends on March 31 of each year.  We refer to our fiscal year, which ended March 31, 2023, as fiscal 2023.  Likewise, we refer to our fiscal years that ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 as fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.  Acquisition - On June 1, 2021, we acquired BN, a privately-owned designer and manufacturer of turbomachinery products for the aerospace, cryogenic, defense and energy markets located in Arvada, Colorado.  We believe that this acquisition furthered our growth strategy through market and product diversification, broadened our offerings to the defense and energy markets, and strengthened our presence in the defense sector.  The purchase price of $72,014 was comprised of shares of common stock, representing a value of $8,964, cash consideration of $61,150 and a contingent earn-out.  A total of $93,121 of assets were acquired including goodwill of $23,523 and other intangibles of $32,500.Our Products, Customers and Markets 	We manufacture critical, custom-engineered products with high quality and reliability including:•Defense Power plant systems - ejectors, surface condensersTorpedo ejection, propulsion & power systems - turbines, alternators, regulators, pumps, blowersThermal management systems - pumps, blowers, drive electronics•SpaceRocket propulsion systems - turbopumps, fuel pumpsCooling systems - pumps, compressors, fans, blowersLife support systems - fans, pumps, blowers•EnergyHeat transfer & vacuum systems - ejectors, process condensers, surface condensers, liquid ring pumps, heat exchangers, nozzlesPower generation systems - turbines, generators, compressors, pumpsThermal management systems - pumps, blowers, electronics•Chemical and Petrochemical ProcessingHeat transfer & vacuum systems - ejectors, process condensers, surface condensers, liquid ring pumps, heat exchangers, nozzles Our products are used in a wide range of applications, including:3 •Defense Aircraft carrier program (CVN)Virginia fast-attack submarine program (SSN)Columbia and Ohio ballistic submarine program (SSBN)U.S. Navy torpedoesRefueling and overhaul replacement equipment•SpaceNASA xEMU next-generation space suit and commercial derivativesRelativity Space's Aeon programVarious commercial space propulsion, fluid and heat transfer applications•Energyconventional oil refiningoil sands extraction and upgradingethanol plantscogeneration power plantsgeothermal and biomass power plantsconcentrated solar powermolten salt reactor developmentsmall modular nuclear reactor developmenthydrogen fuel cell powerzero-emission aviation•Chemical and Petrochemical Processingethylene, methanol and nitrogen producing plants urea and fertilizer plantsplastics, resins and fibers plantsdownstream petrochemical plantscoal-to-chemicals plantsgas-to-liquids plants •Cryogenic Fluid Processessuperconducting cable and magnet coolingspace simulation chambershydrogen production, transportation, distribution, fueling  	Our principal customers include tier one and tier two suppliers to the defense and aerospace industry, refineries, petrochemical plants, large engineering companies that build installations for companies in the energy and process industries (or Engineering Procurement Contractors (“EPCs”), and original equipment manufacturers (""OEM"").  A representative list of our customers include: Aerojet Rocketdyne, Air Liquide, Applied Research Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University, Aramco, Bechtel Plant Machinery Inc., Blue Origin, Boeing, CERN, China State-owned Refiners, Cummins, DuPont, Dow Chemical, General Atomics, General Dynamics, ExxonMobil, Fluor Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Kairos Power, Koch Fertilizer ENID LLC, Lockheed Martin, MHI Compressor International Corporation, NASA, Newport News Shipbuilding, Northrop Grumman, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Raytheon Technologies, SAIC, Sierra Space, U.S. Navy, and United Launch Alliance. 	Our products are sold by a team of sales engineers whom we employ directly.  Two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023 (""Fiscal 2023""). As a result of our diversification efforts to more extensively support the U.S. Navy and the acquisition of BN, we have increased our concentration in domestic and defense sales.  Domestic sales accounted for approximately 81% of total sales in fiscal 2023, while sales to the defense industry were 42%.  Our backlog at March 31, 2023 was $301,734 compared with $256,536 at March 31, 2022.  For more information on this performance indicator see ""Orders and Backlog"" below. Our Strengths	Our core strengths include:•We have a value-enhancing engineering sales and product development platform.  We believe our customer-facing platform of technical sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages.  We have tools and 4 capabilities that we believe allow us to move quickly and comprehensively to meet the unique needs of our customers.  We believe that our early and deep involvement in our customers' projects adds significant value and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve.  We believe customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in a project life cycle to understand how best to utilize our equipment in the optimization of their systems. •We are known for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders.  The orders we receive are extremely complex.  In our markets, we believe that order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality control and engineering documentation are as important as the equipment itself.  We have developed order management capabilities to enable us to deliver high quality, engineered-to-order, as well as build-to-spec, process-critical equipment in a timely manner.  For our customers’ complex, custom orders we typically manage very rigorous interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm, as product design and quality requirements are finalized. Customers' supplier selection process begins by assessing these order management capabilities.•We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment.  Our operations teams are experienced at handling low volume, high mix orders of highly customized solutions.  While certain equipment in a product group may look similar, there are often subtle differences which are required to deliver the desired specification.  Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production.  The markets we serve demand this flexible operating model.•We have the capability to manage outsourced production.  Effectively accessing the global fabrication supply chain expands our market reach, increases execution capacity and can improve competitiveness.  We use this capability for three primary reasons: 1. delivering a lower cost manufacturing option; 2. expanding capacity to execute an order to meet customer timing requirements; and 3. addressing localized content requirements.  We have proven capability to deliver our specialized product designs with outsourced fabrication that meets our high quality standards.•We provide robust technical support.  Our engineering and performance improvement personnel work with our customers to optimize the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues.  Technical expertise is important to our customers throughout the full product lifecycle and we believe their focus is on leveraging our equipment to maximize their systems' productivity.•We have a highly trained workforce. We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and flexible workforce.  We support the development of our employees through programs such as our internal weld school, our partnerships with community colleges and other external training programs.  We continually strive to enhance our corporate culture, develop our employees and improve employee engagement. •We have the capability to manufacture to tight tolerances.  Our manufacturing abilities include the capability to fabricate to tight tolerances.  Additionally, we possess highly specialized manufacturing and electrochemical milling expertise on turbomachinery equipment.  This, combined with our strong quality control with objective quality evidence, provides us a unique competitive advantage.Our StrategyOur strategy is to build a diversified business that provides mission critical, high compliance products requiring exceptional engineering know-how and a highly-skilled and engaged workforce.  We expect to accomplish this by pursuing niche applications in markets with enduring tailwinds that reward differentiated engineered product and full lifecycle scope of work with higher margins. Over the last few years, we have transitioned from a highly cyclical energy business to a diversified company serving multiple markets including the defense, space and alternative energy industries.  Our long-term goal is to drive 8% to 10% average annualized revenue growth and low to mid-teen adjusted EBITDA margins by fiscal year 2027.  We expect to accomplish our goals through the development of our full lifecycle product model serving multiple markets while leveraging business unit synergies to optimize profitability and stability.  Additionally, we believe we must develop a highly engaged team that will drive continual improvement for the long term. Executed effectively, we expect our strategy to create more enduring, recurring opportunities and profitable growth. During fiscal 2023, we stabilized our vacuum and heat transfer business and invested in growth of our turbomachinery business.  As we advance into fiscal 2024, we will continue to evolve our strategy to reduce our cyclicality and further diversify our opportunities as we develop technologies that help solve our customers’ problems.  We are focusing our efforts to: •Pursue clearly defined markets where product and technology differentiation matters;5 •Drive operational excellence while investing in process optimization including digital and automated tools;•Build an elite team of people passionate about their work; and•Engage all stakeholders to capture value. We have not reconciled non-GAAP forward-looking adjusted EBITDA margin to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, as permitted by Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K.  Such reconciliation would require unreasonable efforts to estimate and quantify various necessary GAAP components largely because forecasting or predicting our future operating results is subject to many factors out of our control or not readily predictable. CompetitionOur business is highly competitive.  The principal bases on which we compete include technology, price, performance, reputation, delivery, and quality.  Our competitors listed in alphabetical order by market include: North America Market Principal Competitors   Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program / Defense DC Fabricators; Joseph Oat; PCC; Triumph Aerospace; Xylem   Refining vacuum distillation Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH   Chemicals/petrochemicals Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; Schutte Koerting   Turbomachinery OEM – defense and aerospace/space Ametek, Inc., Concepts NREC; Curtiss Wright; Florida Turbine Technologies; Honeywell; Kratos Defense & Security Solns   Turbomachinery OEM – refining, petrochemical Donghwa Entec Co., Ltd..; KEMCO; Oeltechnik GmbH   Turbomachinery OEM – power and power producer  Holtec; KEMCO; Maarky Thermal Systems; Thermal Engineering International (USA), Inc.       international Market Principal Competitors   Refining vacuum distillation Edwards, Ltd.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH; Korting Hannover AG   Chemicals/petrochemicals Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Edwards, Ltd.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH; Korting Hannover AG; Schutte Koerting   Turbomachinery OEM – refining, petrochemical Chem Process Systems; Donghwa Entec Co., Ltd.; Hangzhou Turbine Equipment Co., Ltd.; KEMCO; Mazda (India); Oeltechnik GmbH   Turbomachinery OEM – power and power producer Chem Process Systems; Holtec; KEMCO; Mazda (India); SPX Heat Transfer; Thermal Engineering International Intellectual Property	Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  We also depend heavily on the brand recognition of the Graham and Barber-Nichols names in the marketplace. 6 Availability of Raw MaterialsAs discussed more fully in Item 1A “Risk Factors
” of this report, inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally due in part to global supply chain issues, a rise in energy prices, labor shortages, and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen from restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Additionally, international conflicts and other geopolitical events, including the ongoing war between Russia and the Ukraine, have further contributed to increased supply chain costs due to shortages in raw materials, increased costs for transportation and energy, disruptions in supply chains, and heightened inflation.  The inflationary environment has increased the cost of our raw materials and labor, which impacted our financial results, especially given that a large percentage of our contracts are fixed-price in nature.  To help mitigate this risk, we place orders for raw materials when the purchase orders are received from the customer to lock-in raw material pricing. Working Capital PracticesOur business does not require us to carry significant amounts of inventory or materials beyond what is needed for work in process.  We negotiate progress payments from our customers on our large projects to finance costs incurred.  We do not provide rights to return goods, or payment terms to customers that we consider to be extended in the context of the industries we serve.  We do provide for warranty claims, which historically have not had a material impact on our results of operations.Government and Environmental RegulationWe are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations in numerous jurisdictions within the United States and in each of the countries where we conduct business.  We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.  These laws, rules and regulations cover several diverse areas including environmental matters, employee health and safety, data and privacy protection, foreign practices, and anti-trust provisions.  Compliance with governmental regulations did not have a material impact on our financial results during fiscal 2023, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.We believe that a focus on environmental stewardship is fundamental and integral to the work we do every day to serve our customers, create value for our stockholders, and benefit our global community.  We have taken steps at both our business units in Batavia, New York and Arvada, Colorado to improve energy efficiencies and air quality and manage water consumption and waste. These efforts are focused on reducing our impact on the environment.  We have enhanced our Environmental, Social and Governance (""ESG"") strategy to align with the broader transformation of our business.  Our executive management team recognizes the importance of embedding environmental and social priorities within our business operations and approved an enhanced and modernized ESG strategy intended to drive additional progress on initiatives that promote sustainability and increase transparency.  We have also established an ESG working group, which is responsible for leading our ESG strategy and monitoring our corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability initiatives.  We do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to be material or to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.  Due to risks in these areas, we cannot provide assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future, which could adversely affect us. SeasonalityNo material part of our business is seasonal in nature.  However, our energy business is highly cyclical as it depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in major capital projects.  To help mitigate this risk, we have taken steps to diversify our business into the defense industry including the acquisition of BN.  For fiscal 2023, sales to the defense industry accounted for approximately 42% of our total sales compared with approximately 25% prior to the acquisition.  Conversely, sales to the refining industry, which are more cyclical in nature, represented approximately 17% of revenue in fiscal 2023 compared with approximately 40% prior to the acquisition.Research and Development ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, we spent $4,144, $3,845 and $3,367, respectively, on research and development (""R&D"") activities.  The majority of our R&D is funded by our customers and is specific to help solve our customers’ problems in order to improve efficiencies, address challenging environments, or redesign for form and function. Additionally, we may be engineering new products and services for our customers and investing to improve existing products and services. Human Capital ResourcesAs of March 31, 2023, we had 538 employees.  We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.At Graham, we believe our most important asset is our people.  We are committed to fostering and embracing a Graham community in which employees share a mutual understanding and respect for each other.  Our pledge to diversity and equality encompasses our commitment to create a work environment which embraces inclusion regardless of race, color, religion, gender, sexual 7 orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, genetic information, marital status, pregnancy, childbirth, disability, veteran status, medical conditions, or any protected status. •Diversity: Our Management recognizes that a diverse workforce and a culture of equity and inclusion helps us compete more effectively for talent, sustain success as a business, and build an engaged employee base.  We encourage every one of our team members to form deeper relationships with those around them based on mutual respect, dignity, and understanding. •Engagement: to encourage productive conversations within our organization, we have implemented employee surveys and an active engagement committee. •Development: We believe that employee development is vital to our continued success, and we support the development of our employees through programs such as our internal weld school training, our partnerships for external weld training, our tuition assistance program, our apprenticeship program, our external partnership with community colleges, and our management training and six sigma training classes.  •Health and Safety: We are dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of our team members by supporting the whole person.  Our dedicated global health and safety function is executed through our business unit safety committees to ensure that employees are trained and understand our best practices to create a safe and healthy workplace for all.   Corporate Governance and Available Information We maintain a website located at www.grahamcorp.com.

 Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations. Risks Related to the Impacts of Macroeconomic EventsDisruptions or delays in our supply chains could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.The raw materials that we source come from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers.  Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial results.  Reliance on our suppliers for these products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials.  Disruptions in our supply chain, especially for an extended period of time, could impact our ability to meet customer requirements and our financial performance could be materially and adversely impacted.Macroeconomic impacts, including rising inflation, a slowdown in the economy, or a recession or expectation of a recession, may result in increased costs of operations and negatively impact the credit and securities markets generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.Current and future conditions in the economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty and are impacted by political, market, health and social events or conditions.  As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the economy as a whole and in the specific markets in which we participate.  Current economic uncertainty and market volatility, including volatility in the banking sector, is anticipated to continue as a result of higher inflation, increased interest rates, supply chain disruptions, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and other geopolitical events.  An inflationary environment can increase our cost of labor, as well as other operating costs, which may have a material and adverse impact on our financial results.  In addition, economic conditions could impact and reduce the number of customers who purchase our products or services as credit becomes more expensive or unavailable.  Although interest rates have increased and are expected to increase further, inflation may continue.  Further, increased interest rates could have a negative effect on the securities markets generally which may, in turn, have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Actual or perceived events involving banking volatility or limited liquidity, defaults or other adverse developments that affect national or international financial systems or financial services industry companies, may result in market-wide liquidity problems which could have a material and adverse impact on our available cash and results of operations. At any point in time, we hold our cash and cash equivalents that we use to meet our working capital needs in deposit accounts at various financial institutions or financial services industry companies at levels that may exceed the applicable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC"") insurance limits or similar government guarantee programs.  While we monitor the cash balances in 8 our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institution or financial services industry company fails.  There is no guarantee that the FDIC, or the applicable deposit insurance, if any, in other countries in which we conduct significant business, will provide access to all or some uninsured funds in the event of the closure, default or non-performance of the financial institution or financial services industry company with which we have a relationship, or that they would do so in a timely manner. Additionally, if any parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access funds with their financial institutions or financial services industry companies with which they have relationships, such parties may be unable to satisfy their obligations to us. To date, we have not experienced significant losses of cash in our operating accounts or our invested cash or cash equivalents as a result of any banking volatility; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our operating cash or invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets.  Further, banking volatility or adverse developments impacting financial systems may make equity or debt financing more difficult to obtain, and additional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all.  Difficulties obtaining equity or debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and in the future may be adversely affected as a result of a global health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  A global health crisis could impact our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others’ ability to conduct business or negatively affect consumer and business confidence or the global economy. A public health crisis has affected, and could affect in the future, large segments of the global economy, including the markets we operate in, disrupting global supply chains, resulting in significant travel and transport restrictions, and creating significant disruption of the financial markets.  Economic uncertainty as a result of any global health crisis could negatively affect our business, suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including as a result of business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, restrictions on shipping, fabricating or installing products, reduced consumer demand or customers’ ability to make payments.  As a result of public health crises, we may experience additional operating costs due to increased challenges with our workforce (including as a result of illness, absenteeism or government orders), implement further precautionary measures to protect the health of our workforce, experience increased project cancellations or projects put on hold, and reduced access to supplies, capital, and fundamental support services (such as shipping and transportation).  Any resulting financial impact from a global health crisis cannot be fully estimated at this time, but may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.For example, due to a potential reduction in throughput capacity related to a global pandemic, such as that experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to deliver products to customers on a timely basis.  Certain contracts in our backlog may contain provisions for a buyer to recover liquidated damages if our delivery is past contractual delivery dates, and such liquidated damages claimed by a customer could adversely affect our financial performance.In addition, we operate and compete globally and the response to global health crises by domestic and foreign governments has been and may be in the future varied and those differences may impact our competitiveness.  There are uncertain political climates in the regions where our subsidiaries operate, and governmental action in those regions may result in the temporary closure or limited operations of our subsidiaries.  Government assistance during a pandemic may also differ between private and public companies, which may provide an advantage to one compared with another.  This may affect our competitive position and could disrupt the market access and success of our business compared with other current or new competitors which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.The extent to which our operations may be impacted by any global health situation will depend largely on future developments which are highly uncertain and we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Even while government restrictions and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have lessened, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting supply chain disruptions, economic recession or depression.  Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this section, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.Risks Related to our Business We may experience customer concentration risk related to strategic growth for U.S. Navy projects.During fiscal 2023, sales to the defense industry continued to grow and represented 42% of our business compared with 51% and 25% of sales to the defense industry in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  While these projects are spread across multiple contractors for the U.S. Navy, the end customer for these projects is the same.  This concentration of business could add additional risk to us should there be a disruption, short or long term, in the funding for these projects or our participation in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion program.The size of our contracts with the U.S. Navy may produce volatility in short term financial results.9 We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities, which are often much larger contracts than our commercial contracts, can, on occasion, be delayed before or during the revenue recognition cycle.  If we are unable to reallocate resources to other projects, we may see an increase in volatility in our near-term financial results and may impact our ability to effectively provide accurate investor guidance.Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks or shifts in focus in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S.  In recent years, the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may decrease demand for our products.  The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding. A disruption in funding or a lapse in funding could materially and adversely impact our business.One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy-related opportunities.  Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders.  The time between the awarding of an order to the completion of shipment can take three to seven years.  Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment.  Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue our production activity on these orders.  Since this business is expected to increase as a percentage of our overall business, such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.In addition, the U.S. has previously experienced lapses in federal appropriations, which had, in the past, a short-term effect on our business.  Any such future lapse (each, a ""Government Shutdown"") could negatively affect our ability to ship finished products to customers.  We rely on federal government personnel, who are not able to perform their duties during a Government Shutdown, to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of our products, process export licenses for us and perform other services for us that, when disrupted, may prevent us from timely shipping products outside the U.S.  If we are unable to timely ship our products outside the U.S., there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business.  Moreover, our inability to ship products, or the perception by customers that we might not be able to timely ship our products in the future, may cause such customers to look to foreign competitors to fulfill their demand.  If our customers look to foreign competitors to source equipment of the type we manufacture, there could be a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and business.Our efforts to expand our U.S. Navy business and changes in the competitive environment for U.S. Navy procurement could materially and adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Over the past few years, we have expanded our business and the opportunities where we bid related to U.S. Navy projects.  Certain of our business expansions have relied, and in the future may rely, on awards or grants for capital expenditures related to build-outs to support this business.  If we are unable to meet the required milestone achievements for these build-outs in a timely way, we may be exposed to penalties or other added costs.In addition, our increased market share has caused an adverse share position for some of our competitors for these products. Competitor response to our market penetration is possible.  Our customers may also raise concerns about their supplier concentration issues and the risk exposure related to this concentration.  As the U.S. Navy is looking to expand its fleet, there is also a risk that their facilities, their supply chain or our supply chain for raw materials, may not be able to support this expansion.  This could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.  Further, the bidding process related to these U.S. Navy projects requires us to devote a certain amount of time and resources to prepare bids and proposals and there is no assurance that we will recoup those investments.Contract liabilities for large U.S. Navy contracts may be beyond our normal insurance coverage and a claim could have an adverse impact on our financial results.We are diligent at managing ongoing risks related to projects and the requirements of our customers.  In addition, we secure business insurance coverage to minimize the impact of a major failure or liability related to our customers.  Due to certain U.S. government procurement policies, we may take on the risk of a liability for large U.S. Navy projects in excess of our insurance coverage and at a level which is higher than our commercial projects.  A claim related to one of these projects could have an adverse impact on our financial results.10 New technology used by the ships for the U.S. Navy may delay projects and may impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Certain U.S. Navy vessels are implementing new technologies, unrelated to any of the equipment that we provide.  If there is a complication or delay to any ship caused by this new technology, it may delay the procurement and fabrication of future vessels, which could have a negative impact on our business.Zero defect and other unfavorable provisions in government contracts, some of which are customary, may subject our business to material limitations, restrictions and uncertainties and may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. Government contracts contain provisions that provide the U.S. government with substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the U.S. government to inspect our products and unilaterally determine whether additional work is required to be completed to remedy any deemed deficiencies; to terminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason; unilaterally reduce or modify the government’s obligations under such contracts without our consent; decline to exercise an option to continue a contract or exercise an option to purchase only the minimum amount, if any, specified in a contract; take actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected; and change the course of a program in a manner that differs from the contract’s original terms or from our desired plan.Generally, government contracts, including our contracts with the U.S. Navy, contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the U.S. government’s convenience.  Under general principles of government contracting law, if the U.S. government terminates a contract for convenience, the government contractor may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination.  If the U.S. government terminates a contract for default, the government contractor is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source.  In addition, government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions.  These requirements include, for example, unilateral inspection rights and the requirement that we complete additional work to remedy any deemed deficiency; specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts; mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent; mandatory internal control systems and policies; and mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.  If we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, we may be subject to potential contract liability and to termination of our government contracts.Furthermore, any agreements and subcontracts with third parties, including suppliers, consultants and other third-party contractors that we enter into in order to satisfy our contractual obligations pursuant to our agreements with the U.S. government must also be compliant with the terms of our government contract.  Negotiating and entering into such arrangements can be time-consuming and we may not be able to reach agreement with such third parties.  Any delay or inability to enter into such arrangements or entering into such arrangements in a manner that is non-compliant with the terms of our government contract, may result in violations of our contract.The markets we serve include the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries.  These industries are both highly cyclical in nature and dependent on the prices of crude oil and natural gas.  As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results. A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, and petroleum refining industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries.  These industries are highly cyclical, and are subject to the prices of crude oil and natural gas.  The prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically had periods when they have been very volatile, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in oil prices over the past few years, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine-Russia war, and macroeconomic impacts.  During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers often refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes and future demand projections are clearer.  If our customers refrain from placing orders with us, our revenue would decline and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Further, our commercial customers in these markets confront competing budget priorities and may have more limited resources for the types of products and services we provide.  As a result, there may be fewer projects available for us to compete for and the pricing environment is anticipated to remain challenging.  A sustained deterioration in any of the chemical, petrochemical, and petroleum refining industries we serve, would materially and adversely harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.11 The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production, and transitions in consumer demand toward different types of energy, may have a material and adverse impact on our business and operating results.Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others.  A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities.  A demand shift, where technological advances or consumer preferences favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact the demand for our products.  Changes in consumer demand, including some driven by governmental and political preferences, toward electric, compressed natural gas, hydrogen vehicles and other alternative energy may impact our business.  We have products which can support certain technologies, while other technologies will not require our equipment.  If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources.  For example, non-fossil based sources may receive government tax incentives to foster investment.  If these incentives become more prominent, our business and results of operations could suffer.Climate change and greenhouse gas regulations may affect our customers’ investment decisions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These restrictions may affect our customers' abilities and willingness to invest in new facilities or to re-invest in current operations.  These requirements could impact the cost of our customers’ products, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower-carbon sources.  Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our future success may be affected by our current and future indebtedness.Under our loan agreements, as of March 31, 2023, we had $12,500 outstanding under our term loan with Bank of America, N.A. (""Bank of America"").  We may borrow additional funds in the future to support our growth and working capital needs.  Pursuant to our loan agreements with Bank of America, we are required to provide financial information and reports while complying with other financial covenants.  On February 4, 2022, March 31, 2022 and June 7, 2022, we entered into amendment agreements with Bank of America that placed additional restrictive covenants on the Company and increased our borrowing costs.  In the future, should we be out of compliance with our bank agreement, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers or renegotiate our credit facilities in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all.  If we were not able to obtain a covenant waiver under our debt facilities or renegotiate such facilities, we could be in default of such agreements, and in the event of such default our lender could demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding.  There can be no assurance that we would have sufficient cash, or be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities in the event of such demand.  As a result, the failure to obtain covenant waivers or renegotiate our facilities as described above would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to service our debt obligations.Our business is highly competitive.  If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.We encounter intense competition in all of our markets.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources.  Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Certain competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us due to their geography or changes in relative currency values and may compete against us based on price.  This may affect our ability to secure new business and maintain our level of profitability.  As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers.  Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers.  If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected.Customer focus on short-term costs versus prioritizing quality and brand recognition, could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.Although we have long-term relationships with many of our customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different.  Our customers have historically focused on the quality of the engineering and product solutions which we have provided to them, which may come at a higher cost.  Because our customers are unable to predict the length of the time period for the economic 12 viability of their plants, there has been more of a focus on relative importance of cost versus quality which looks at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost of operations. In addition, customers in emerging markets which are driving global demand growth may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain other industrialized countries where we compete.  If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. A change in the structure of our markets, including through consolidation, could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.There are strong and long-standing relationships throughout the supply chain between the many parties involved in serving the end user of our products.  A change in the landscape between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain, and/or with the end users could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  These changes, or others, might occur through industry consolidations such as mergers, acquisitions or other business partnerships, and could have a material impact on our business and negatively impact our financial results. The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations. While we may have only one or two customers that represent over 10% of revenue in any one year, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales.  For example, sales to our top ten customers, who can vary each year, accounted for 46%, 42% and 63% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively.  We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future.  The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers, or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions.  In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management.  We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, issues or liabilities, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our management’s attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting.  Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisition’s existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business.  We also need to utilize key personnel who may be distracted from the core business.  If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition’s business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.We have foreign operations and a percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.For fiscal 2023, 19% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S.  Moreover, through our subsidiaries, we maintain a sales office in China and a sales and market development office in India.  We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available.  Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:•nationalization of private enterprises and assets;•trade policies incentivizing domestic trade over international trade;•political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East and/or portions of the former Soviet Union;•the global economic impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or future global health concerns;•political relationships between the U.S. and certain countries and regions;•differences in foreign laws, including difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;•the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy;13 •credit risks;•currency fluctuations;•tariff and tax increases;•export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments; •shipping products during times of crisis or war;•our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; or•other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations.Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be materially and adversely impacted by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. laws or the laws of the applicable jurisdiction where we do business, including, among others, laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy.  In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, if any, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees.  In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material and adverse effect on our financial statements.The impact of potential changes in customs and trade policies and tariffs imposed by the U.S. and those imposed in response by other countries, including China, as well as rapidly changing trade relations, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.The U.S. government has made proposals that are intended to address trade imbalances, which include encouraging increased production in the United States.  These proposals could result in increased customs duties and the renegotiation of some U.S. trade agreements.  Changes in U.S. and foreign governments’ trade policies have resulted and may continue to result in tariffs on imports into, and exports from, the U.S.  In the past, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from several countries, including China, Canada, the European Union and Mexico.  In response, China, Canada and the European Union have proposed or implemented their own tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. into those countries.  Tariffs affecting our products and product components, including raw materials we use, particularly high-end steel and steel related products, may add significant costs to us and make our products more expensive. Potential future changes in trade policies could result in customers changing their behavior in project procurement, due to uncertainty related to timely execution and/or import and export restrictions.  As a result, our products could become less attractive to customers outside the U.S. due to U.S. import tariffs on our raw materials and our profit margins would be negatively impacted.  Accordingly, continued tariffs may weaken relationships with certain trading partners and may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.  When beneficial to us, we may consider alternate sourcing options, including offshore subcontracting, in order to minimize the impact of the tariffs.  Because we conduct aspects of our business in China through our subsidiary, potential reductions in trade with China and diminished relationships between China and the U.S., as well as the continued escalation of tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The operations of our subsidiary in China may be adversely affected by China’s evolving economic, political and social conditions. We conduct our business in China primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary.  The results of operations and future prospects of our subsidiary in China may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China's political, economic and social conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases and changes in the rates or methods of taxation.  In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users.  Also, China's commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing.  These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or the operation of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China and India, which could harm our business. 14 Commercial law in China is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter.  Similarly, proprietary information may not be afforded the same protection in India as it is in our other major markets with more comprehensive intellectual property laws. Although we take precautions in the operations of our subsidiaries to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business.  We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Uncertainties with respect to the legal system in China may adversely affect the operations of our subsidiary in that country.Our subsidiary in China is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.  There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China.  The legal system in China is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value.  Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform.  Moreover, the relative inexperience of China's judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas.  Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.  For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulation of foreign investment in India may adversely affect the operations of our Indian subsidiary.Our subsidiary in India is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in India.  India regulates ownership of Indian companies by foreign entities.  These regulations may apply to our funding of our Indian operating subsidiary.  For example, the government of India has set out criteria for foreign investments in India, including requirements with respect to downstream investments by companies in India which are owned or controlled by foreign entities and the transfer of ownership or control of  companies in India in certain industries.  These requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate our Indian subsidiary.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required approvals for future acquisitions, investments or operations in India, or that we will be able to obtain such approvals on satisfactory terms.Changes in U.S. and foreign energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business.Energy policy in the U.S. and other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur, as they may be related to changes in political administration, public policy or other factors.  The elimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.Near-term income statement impact from competitive contracts could adversely affect our operating results.During weaker market periods, we may choose to be more aggressive in pricing certain competitive projects to protect or gain market share or to increase the utilization of our facilities.  In these situations, it is possible that an incrementally profitable order, while increasing contribution, may be unprofitable from an accounting perspective when including fixed manufacturing costs.  In these situations, we are required to recognize the financial loss at the time of order acceptance, or as soon as our cost estimates are updated, whichever occurs first.  It is possible we may accumulate losses either on a large project or more than one project such that, in a short time period, for example a reporting quarter, these losses may have a meaningful impact on the earnings for that period.Our operating results could be adversely affected by customer contract cancellations and delays.Adverse economic or specific project conditions can lead to a project being placed on hold or cancelled by our customers.  We had one project cancelled in fiscal 2023 and no projects cancelled in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.  We had no projects on hold at March 31, 2023.  As further discussed in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on April 4, 2023, Virgin Orbit Holdings, Inc. (""Virgin Orbit"") commenced voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (""Chapter 11 Bankruptcy"").  As a result, we reversed approximately $4,000 of purchase orders and recorded approximately $2,500 of reserves for inventory and accounts receivable during fiscal 2023 related to Virgin Orbit, net of associated performance-based compensation.  As of March 31, 2023, we estimate that we have approximately $1,000 to $2,000 of additional exposure related to Virgin Orbit depending on the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings, but currently do not expect any material financial impact to fiscal 2024 results.We attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred.  As a result, we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled.  Open orders are reviewed continuously through communications with 15 customers.  If it becomes evident to us that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date, management will move the project into ""placed on hold"" (i.e., suspended) category.  Furthermore, if a project is cancelled by our customer, it is removed from our backlog.The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2023 was $301,734.  Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders.  The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2023 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales.  Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.  This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil.  We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future.  Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations.  Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results.Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy.  In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in this end market which offers large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base.  A delay, long-term extension or cancellation of any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Further, certain defense contracts we secure may be designated a program of highest national priority requiring production preference over commercial orders which could impact our commercial backlog and result in production delays.  As a result, commercial customers could seek damages, including liquidated damages, as performance penalties and there may be a negative impact to the willingness of customers to place future orders with us due to a concern that orders may be subordinated to such contracts.Our customers’ ability and willingness to make progress payments may be impacted by any extended downturn in their markets which could adversely impact their financial stability and increase the risk to us of uncollectable accounts receivables.The financial strength of our customers can be impacted by a severe or lengthy downturn in their markets which could lead to additional risk in our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables.  We attempt to mitigate this risk with the utilization of progress payments for many projects, but certain industries, end markets and geographies are not as willing to make progress payments.  Certain projects require a small portion of the total payments to be held until the customer's facility is fully operational, which can be in excess of one year beyond our delivery of equipment to them.  This additional time may add risk to our ability to collect on the outstanding accounts receivables.Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contracts could negatively impact our results of operations. A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed-price commitments by us to our customers.  While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, estimating errors, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes.  For example, in fiscal 2022, we experienced material cost overruns related to defense contracts at our Batavia, NY facility.  To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability may decrease or losses may be incurred which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  For our U.S. Navy projects, these fixed-priced contracts have order to shipment periods which can exceed five years.  This additional time-based risk, which we believe is manageable, nevertheless increases the likelihood of cost fluctuation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.We may experience losses if we are unable to collect on our accounts receivables if our customers are unable or unwilling to pay their invoices in a timely manner or at all.Our customers, even those we have had a long-standing business relationship with, may at any time, experience economic hardship which could cause those customers to be unwilling or unable to pay their invoices in a timely manner or at all.  In addition, a number of our customers may have limited resources and may not have a history of creditworthiness that we can audit to determine reliability for payment of accounts receivable.  For example, many of our customers and the key players within the space industry have not yet achieved profitability, have incurred significant losses since inception, and may be unable to achieve profitability when expected, if at all, similar to Virgin Orbit as discussed above.  As such, our ability to predict and plan for future revenue and operations within the space industry is subject to risk.  Due to the variable nature of sales and orders within the space industry our future revenue and growth in the space industry is uncertain and may materially and adversely impact our results of operations. To the extent a company is unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations to us it could result in a material and adverse impact to our results of operations.  Even if they are financially solvent and stable and we are successful in securing a commercial relationship with them, their business plans for future programs may be inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and less structured than other companies.  If any of our customers suffers significant financial difficulties, insolvency or bankruptcy, they may be unable to pay us in a timely manner or at all.  It is also possible that our customers may contest their obligations to pay us, including under bankruptcy laws 16 or otherwise.  Even if our customers do not contest their obligations to pay us, if our customers are unable to pay us in a timely manner, it could materially and adversely impact our ability to collect accounts receivable.  Moreover, we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extended financing terms with these customers in such a situation in an attempt to secure outstanding payments or partial payment.  Accordingly, if we are unable to collect upon our accounts receivable as they come due in an efficient and timely manner, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Given our size and specialization of our business, if we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense.  Moreover, our technology is highly specialized, and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel.  Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.  If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel, including our engineering, production and technology professionals; if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business could be harmed.We believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of our highly skilled work force, including our specialized engineers, machinists, and welders.  Our ability to successfully pursue our growth strategy and compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain our personnel.  Competition for well-qualified employees in all aspects of our business, including our skilled production workers such as welders, machinists, and engineers, is intense, and it may be even more challenging to retain qualified personnel as many companies have moved to offer a remote or hybrid work environment, and considering the current period of heightened employee attrition in the United States and other countries.  In response to competition, rising inflation rates and labor shortages, we may need to adjust employee compensation, which could affect our operating costs and margins, as well as potentially cause dilution to existing stockholders.  We may also lose new employees to our competitors in any of our markets before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them.  If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business would be materially and adversely affected. If we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of our products, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us.  For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage.  In addition, BN produces certain products in large quantities which could also expose us to potential product warranty and liability claims.Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances.  Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and our historical experience may not reflect liabilities we may face in the future.  Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex or larger projects.  We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all.  Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us.  We may also incur significant warranty claims which are not covered by insurance.  In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer.  We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if we were found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer.  Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.17 In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights.  Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based in U.S. dollars - primarily the Chinese RMB and India INR.  Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies.  Strength of the U.S. dollar compared with the Euro, India, or Asian currencies may put us in a less competitive position.  Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified.  In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings could be adversely impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. At March 31, 2023, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business.  We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems.  Threats to these systems, and the laws and regulations governing security of data, including personal data, on information systems and otherwise held by companies is evolving and adding layers of complexity in the form of new requirements and increasing costs of attempting to protect information systems and data and complying with new cybersecurity regulations.  Information systems are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our information systems, computer technology, and business.  Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information systems and computer technology to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats and ransomware.  The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.  The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident and its effects include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission or other government agencies, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.  A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions, ransom payments, and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations.  Further, our technology resources may be strained due to an increase in the number of remote users.  Cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions.  While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.  In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our enterprise resource planning system utilized at our facilities in Batavia, N.Y. is aging, and we may experience issues from implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system.We have an enterprise resource planning system (“ERP”) to assist with the collection, storage, management and interpretation of data from our business activities to support future growth and to integrate significant processes.  Our ERP at our Batavia, N.Y. operations is aging and we expect to begin implementing a new ERP during fiscal 2024.  ERP implementations are complex, distracting to the business and management, and time-consuming and involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities, as well as changes in business processes.  Our ERP is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record transactions, provide important information to our management and prepare our consolidated financial statements. ERP implementations also require the transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the new ERP; any such transformation involves risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system, including loss of information and potential disruption to our normal operations.  Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of a new ERP could adversely affect our ability to 18 process orders, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.  Additionally, if the ERP does not operate as intended, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected or our ability to assess it adequately could be delayed.  Further, we may not realize the benefits we anticipate should all or part of the ERP upgrade implementation process prove to be ineffective.  Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operations and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.  In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us.  For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination.  Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Many of our large international customers are nationalized or state-owned businesses.  Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations.We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.  Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions.  Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products.  We strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring.  However, we operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental corruption problems to some degree and where strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices, and it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible.  Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from unauthorized reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.  In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management.  If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The terms of our loan agreement restrict our ability to pay dividends, and we may not be able to pay dividends in the future.Our loan agreement with Bank of America contains terms that restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends.  Any determination by our Board of Directors regarding dividends in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including our future financial performance, organic growth opportunities, general economic conditions and financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.  There can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends in the future. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders' ability to change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Such provisions include:•We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.  Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock.  We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.•Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year.  This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors.19 •Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting.  Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.  •Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote.  In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction. •Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.  Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.  This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.•Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.  Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.  This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board"

Business Graham Corporation (""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" or the ""Company"") is a global leader in the design and manufacture of mission critical fluid, power, heat transfer and vacuum technologies for the defense, space, energy and process industries. For the defense industry, our equipment is used in nuclear and non-nuclear propulsion, power, fluid transfer, and thermal management systems. For the space industry our equipment is used in propulsion, power and energy management systems and for life support systems.  Our energy and new energy markets include oil refining, cogeneration, and multiple alternative and clean power applications including hydrogen. For the chemical and petrochemical industries, our equipment is used in fertilizer, ethylene, methanol and downstream chemical facilities. We design and manufacture custom-engineered vacuum, heat transfer, pump and turbomachinery technologies. Our corporate headquarters is located in Batavia, New York. We have production facilities co-located with our headquarters in Batavia. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Barber-Nichols, LLC (""BN"") is based in Arvada, Colorado (see ""Acquisition"" below). We also have wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries, Graham Vacuum and Heat Transfer Technology (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. (""GVHTT""), located in Suzhou, China and Graham India Private Limited (""GIPL""), located in Ahmedabad, India.  GVHTT provides sales and engineering support for us in the People's Republic of China and management oversight throughout Southeast Asia. GIPL serves as a sales and market development office focusing on the refining, petrochemical and fertilizer markets in India. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1983 and are the successor to Graham Manufacturing Co., Inc., which was incorporated in New York in 1936.  Our stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ""GHM"".  Acquisition - On June 1, 2021, we acquired BN, a privately-owned designer and manufacturer of turbomachinery products for the aerospace, cryogenic, defense and energy markets. The acquisition included BN’s new, 43,000 square foot manufacturing plant, which is part of their 96,000 square foot leased facility in Arvada, Colorado. We believe that this acquisition furthers our growth strategy through market and product diversification, broadened our offerings to the defense and energy markets, and strengthened our presence in the defense sector.

A representative list of our customers include: Aerojet Rocketdyne,  Air Liquide, Applied Research Laboratory, Aramco, Bechtel Plant Machinery Inc., Boeing, CERN, China State-owned Refiners, Cummins, DuPont, Dow Chemical, General Atomics, General Dynamics, General Electric, ExxonMobil, Fluor Corporation, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., Kairos Power, Koch Fertilizer ENID LLC, Lockheed Martin, MHI Compressor International Corporation, NASA, Newport News Shipbuilding, Northrop Grumman, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Raytheon Technologies, SAIC, Sierra Space, U.S. Navy, and Virgin Orbit. 	Our products are sold by a team of sales engineers whom we employ directly.  Two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2022 (""Fiscal 2022""). As a result of our diversification efforts to more extensively support the U.S. Navy and the acquisition of BN, we have increased our concentration in domestic and defense sales in 2022.  Domestic sales accounted for 80% of total sales in fiscal 2022, while sales to the defense industry were 51%.  Our backlog at March 31, 2022 was $256,536 compared with $137,567 at March 31, 2021. BN comprised $117,769 of this backlog at March 31, 2022.Our Strengths	Our core strengths include:•We have a value-enhancing sales and development platform.  We believe our customer-facing platform of sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages.  We have tools and capabilities that we believe allow us to move quickly and comprehensively to meet the unique needs of our customers.  We believe that our early and deep involvement adds significant value to the process and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve.  We believe customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in the project life cycle to understand how best to utilize our equipment.  •We are known for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders.  The orders we receive are extremely complex.  In our markets, we believe that order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality and engineering 4 documentation are as important as the equipment itself.  We have developed order management capabilities to enable us to deliver high quality, engineered-to-order and build-to-spec process-critical equipment in a timely manner.  For our customers’ complex, custom orders we typically manage very rigorous interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm, as product design and quality requirements are finalized. Customer supplier selection process begins by assessing these order management capabilities.•We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment.  Our operations teams are experienced at handling low volume, high mix orders that are highly customized solutions.  We believe that our production environment is much different from a highly engineered standard products business.  While certain equipment in a product group may look similar, there are often subtle differences which are required to deliver the desired specification.  Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production.  The markets we serve demand this flexible operating model.•We have the capability to manage outsourced production.  Effectively accessing the global fabrication supply chain expands our market reach, increases execution capacity and can improve competitiveness.  We use this capability for three primary reasons: 1. delivering a lower cost manufacturing option; 2. expanding capacity to execute an order to meet customer timing requirements; and 3. addressing localized content requirements.  We have proven capability to deliver our specialized product designs with outsourced fabrication that is on-time, within budget and that meets our high quality standards.•We provide robust after-the-sale technical support.  Our engineering and performance improvement personnel go to customer sites to audit the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues.  Technical service after a sale is important to our customers as we believe their focus is always on leveraging our equipment to maximize their facilities’ productivity.•We have a highly trained workforce. We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and extremely flexible workforce. We have been challenged by labor shortages in our local markets.  To help offset this impact, we support the development of our employees through programs such as our internal weld school training and our partnerships with community colleges and other external weld training programs.•We have the unique capability to manufacture to tight tolerances.  Our manufacturing abilities include the unique capability to fabricate large weldments with special metallurgy to tight tolerances. Additionally, we possess highly specialized manufacturing and electrochemical milling expertise on turbomachinery equipment that allows us to manufacture to tight tolerances. This, combined with our strong quality control with objective quality evidence, provides us a unique competitive advantage.Our Strategy Our mission: Build Better Companies to Deliver Superior Performance.  We currently have strategies that address our two operations which are in different phases of their business cycle.  For Graham Manufacturing in Batavia, which is in the midst of evolution and change, we are executing a four-step strategy as follows:1.Stabilize: We identified areas for process and system improvement and implemented a strengthened structure designed to enable strong execution and reduce risk.  This included a reorganization and alignment of key management positions, and the addition of a new Director of Sales, Director of Navy Operations and Navy supervisors, Director of Commercial Operations, Human Resource Manager, and Chief Financial Officer. During this period, we have had positive communication with our key customers that have expressed support for our changes and progress. 2.Improve: We have defined a roadmap to improve our operations, which is driven by better information flow and accountability. We are focused on improving returns in our target markets by driving operational effectiveness and developing capabilities to provide more value to our customers. Priorities will be on business visibility and analysis, new products, enhanced service and support, cost effective manufacturing and engineering, and employee recruitment and engagement.3.Grow: With a large installed base, we expect to leverage our vacuum and heat transfer expertise to grow over time into a larger and more profitable business.4.Mature to Full Lifecycle Product Strategy: This covers the spectrum from customer collaboration in developing markets to investing in and executing production and service programs. 5   Our near and mid-term strategy for BN focuses on continued development and growth to deliver on our long-term goal of achieving a full lifecycle product strategy.  Elements include:1.Nurture customer partnerships in developing industries such as alternative energy: We will pursue opportunities with customers in leading positions in their markets where we can develop technology that is scalable and leverageable across high compliance, leading edge applications.2.Validate customized solutions in new applications: We will foster early relationships with customers and pursue opportunities in pre-specification phases.  We will develop customized solutions with extensive validation to “lock-in” long term production.  Our emphasis is on requirements management and proving compliance.3.Develop disruptive products and technologies for currently served markets: Pursue opportunities that benefit from disruptive solutions and require full life cycle support including aftermarket. Our emphasis is on system analysis trade studies and product family design.4.Invest in and execute to win production and service programs: Execute high compliance production programs with excellence and quick response to earn additional opportunities. Proactively offer tangible solutions to known supply or technical issues. Our emphasis is on Design for Manufacturing, Assembly, Inspection & Test and continual improvement. Executed effectively, we believe our strategies will create more enduring, recurring opportunities and profitable growth. CompetitionOur business is highly competitive.  The principal bases on which we compete include technology, price, performance, reputation, delivery, and quality.  Our competitors listed in alphabetical order by market include: North America Market Principal Competitors   Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program / Defense DC Fabricators; Joseph Oat; PCC; Triumph Aerospace; Xylem   Refining vacuum distillation Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH   Chemicals/petrochemicals Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; Schutte Koerting   Turbomachinery OEM – defense and aerospace/space Ametek, Inc., Concepts NREC; Curtis Wright; Honeywell; Kratos Defense & Security Solns   Turbomachinery OEM – refining, petrochemical Donghwa Entec Co., Ltd..; KEMCO; Oeltechnik GmbH   Turbomachinery OEM – power and power producer  Holtec; KEMCO; Maarky Thermal Systems; Thermal Engineering International (USA), Inc.       international Market Principal Competitors   Refining vacuum distillation Edwards, Ltd.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH; Korting Hannover AG   Chemicals/petrochemicals Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Edwards, Ltd.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH; Korting Hannover AG; Schutte Koerting   Turbomachinery OEM – refining, petrochemical Chem Process Systems; Donghwa Entec Co., Ltd.; Hangzhou Turbine Equipment Co., Ltd.; KEMCO; Mazda (India); Oeltechnik GmbH   Turbomachinery OEM – power and power producer Chem Process Systems; Holtec; KEMCO; Mazda (India); SPX Heat Transfer; Thermal Engineering International 6  Intellectual Property	Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  We also depend heavily on the brand recognition of the Graham name in the marketplace. Availability of Raw MaterialsHistorically, we have not been materially adversely impacted by the availability of raw materials. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic and supply chain disruptions, we have seen upward pricing pressure on parts and raw materials.  This has also resulted in increased operational challenges from workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at our customers and suppliers, leading to increases in prices and freight costs.  As discussed more fully in Item 1A “Risk Factors
” of this report, the raw materials that we source come from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial results. Disruptions in our supply chain, especially for an extended period of time, could impact our ability to meet customer requirements and our financial performance could be materially and adversely impacted. Inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally due in part to global supply chain issues, a rise in energy prices, labor shortages, and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen from restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The inflationary environment has increased the cost of our raw materials and labor which impacted our financial results, especially given that a large percentage of our contracts are fixed price in nature. To help mitigate this risk, we place orders for raw materials when the purchase orders are received from the customer to lock-in raw material pricing.Working Capital PracticesOur business does not require us to carry significant amounts of inventory or materials beyond what is needed for work in process. We negotiate progress payments from our customers on our large projects to finance costs incurred.  We do not provide rights to return goods, or payment terms to customers that we consider to be extended in the context of the industries we serve. We do provide for warranty claims, which historically have not had a material impact on our results of operations.Government and Environmental RegulationWe are subject to a variety of laws, rules and regulations in numerous jurisdictions within the United States and in each of the countries where we conduct business. These laws, rules and regulations cover several diverse areas including environmental matters, employee health and safety, data and privacy protection, and anti-trust provisions. We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with governmental regulations did not have a material impact on our financial results during fiscal 2022, and is not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.We believe that a focus on environmental stewardship is fundamental and integral to the work we do every day to serve our customers, create value for our stockholders, and benefit our global community. We have taken steps at both our business units in Batavia, New York and Arvada, Colorado to improve energy efficiencies and air quality that are intended to lessen our impact on the environment. We do not expect environmental costs or contingencies to be material or to have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Due to risks in these areas, we cannot provide assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future which could adversely affect us. SeasonalityNo material part of our business is seasonal in nature.  However, our energy business is highly cyclical in nature as it depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in major capital projects. To help mitigate this risk, we have taken steps to diversify our business into the defense industry including the acquisition of BN.  For fiscal 2022, sales to the defense industry accounted for 51% of our total sales compared to 25% for the twelve month period ending March 31, 2021 (""Fiscal 2021""). Conversely, sales to the refining industry, which are more cyclical in nature, represented 20% of revenue in fiscal 2022 compared to 41% in fiscal 2021.Research and Development ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 (""Fiscal 2020""), we spent $3,845, $3,367 and $3,353, respectively, on research and development (""R&D"") activities.  The majority of our R&D is funded by our customers and is specific to help solve our customers’ problems in order to improve efficiencies, address challenging environments or caustic materials, or redesign for form and function. Additionally, we may be engineering new products and services for our customers. We also continually look to improve existing products and services. 7 Human Capital ResourcesAs of March 31, 2022, we had 491 employees.

  Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations.  Risks Related to the Impacts of Macroeconomic EventsOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health issues, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected if the COVID-19 pandemic, or another global health crisis, impacts our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others’ ability to conduct business or negatively affects consumer and business confidence or the global economy. The COVID-19 health crisis has affected large segments of the global economy, including the markets we operate in, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, and created significant disruption of the financial markets. Economic uncertainty as a result of any global health crisis could negatively affect our business, suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including as a result of business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, restrictions on shipping, fabricating or installing products, reduced consumer demand or customers’ ability to make payments. We have and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to increased challenges with our workforce (including as a result of illness, absenteeism or government orders), implementing further precautionary measures to protect the health of our workforce, increased project cancellations or projects put on hold, access to supplies, capital, and fundamental support services (such as shipping and transportation).  Any resulting financial impact cannot be fully estimated at this time, but may materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Due to a potential COVID-19 reduction in throughput capacity, certain contracts in our backlog may experience delayed shipment. We accept contracts that contain provisions for a buyer to recover liquidated damages if our delivery is past contractual delivery dates, and such liquidated damages claimed by a customer could adversely affect financial performance.In addition, we operate and compete globally and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by domestic and foreign governments has been and may continue to be varied and those differences may impact our competitiveness.  Our operating subsidiaries are located in China and India, and those countries’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have varied from the United States’ response. There are uncertain political climates in the regions where our subsidiaries operate, and governmental action in those regions may result in the temporary closure or limited operations of our subsidiaries.  Government assistance during a pandemic may also differ between private and public companies, which may provide an advantage to one compared with another. This may affect our competitive position and could disrupt the market access and success of our business compared with other current or new competitors which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.The extent to which our operations may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or any global health situation will depend largely on future developments which are highly uncertain and we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Even while government restrictions and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have lessened, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting supply chain disruptions, economic recession or depression. Furthermore, the impacts of a potential worsening of global economic conditions and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain unknown. Our management team has, and will likely continue to, spend significant time, attention and resources monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and seeking to manage its effects on our business and workforce.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this section, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. This pandemic is still ongoing and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.Disruptions or delays in our supply chains could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.The raw materials that we source come from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial results. Disruptions in our supply chain, especially for an extended period of time, could impact our ability to meet customer requirements and our financial performance could be materially and adversely impacted.Rising inflation may result in increased costs of operations and negatively impact the credit and securities markets generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our common stock.Inflation has accelerated in the U.S. and globally due in part to global supply chain issues, the Ukraine-Russia war, a rise in energy prices, and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen from restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. An inflationary environment can increase our cost of labor, as well as our other operating costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, economic conditions could impact and reduce the number of customers who purchase our products 9 or services as credit becomes more expensive or unavailable. Although interest rates have increased and are expected to increase further, inflation may continue. Further, increased interest rates could have a negative effect on the securities markets generally which may, in turn, have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Risks Related to our Business We may experience customer concentration risk related to strategic growth for U.S. Navy projects.The acquisition of BN has changed the composition of the Company’s end market mix. For fiscal 2022, sales to the defense industry were 51% of our business compared with just 25% of sales to the defense industry in fiscal 2021. While these projects are spread across multiple contractors for the U.S. Navy, the end customer for these projects is the same. This concentration of business could add additional risk to us should there be a disruption, short or long term, in the funding for these projects or our participation in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion program.The size of our contracts with the U.S. Navy may produce volatility in short term financial results.We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities, which are often much larger contracts than our commercial contracts, can, on occasion, be delayed before or during the revenue recognition cycle.  If we are unable to reallocate resources to other projects, we may see an increase in volatility in our near-term financial results and may impact our ability to effectively provide accurate investor guidance.Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks or shifts in focus in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S. In recent years, the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding. A disruption in funding could adversely impact our business.One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy-related opportunities.  Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders.  The time between the awarding of an order to the completion of shipment can take three to seven years.  Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment.  Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue our production activity on these orders.  Since this business is expected to increase as a percentage of our overall business, such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.Changes in the competitive environment for U.S. Navy procurement could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Over the past few years, we have expanded our business and the opportunities where we bid related to U.S. Navy projects.  This has increased our market share and caused an adverse share position for some of our competitors for these products.  Competitor response to our market penetration is possible.  Our customers may also raise concerns about their supplier concentration issues and the risk exposure related to this concentration.  As the U.S. Navy is looking to expand its fleet, there is also a risk that their facilities, their supply chain or our supply chain for raw materials, may not be able to support this expansion.  This could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business. Further, the bidding process related to these U.S. Navy projects requires us to devote a certain amount of time and resources to prepare bids and proposals and there is no assurance that we will recoup those investments.Contract liabilities for large U.S. Navy contracts may be beyond our normal insurance coverage and a claim could have an adverse impact on our financial results.We are diligent at managing ongoing risks related to projects and the requirements of our customers.  In addition, we secure business insurance coverage to minimize the impact of a major failure or liability related to our customers.  Due to certain U.S. government procurement policies, we may take on the risk of a liability for large U.S. Navy projects in excess of our insurance coverage and at a level which is higher than our commercial projects.  A claim related to one of these projects could have an adverse impact on our financial results.New technology used by the ships for the U.S. Navy may delay projects and may impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Certain U.S. Navy vessels are implementing new technologies, unrelated to any of the equipment that we provide.  If there is a complication or delay to any ship caused by this new technology, it may delay the procurement and fabrication of future vessels, which could have a negative impact on our business.10 Lapses in U.S. government appropriations have occurred, and any future lapses could disrupt U.S. export processing and related procedures and, as a result, may materially and adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and business.The U.S. has previously experienced lapses in federal appropriations, which had, in the past, a short-term effect on our business.  Any such future lapse (each, a ""Government Shutdown"") could negatively affect our ability to ship finished products to customers.  We rely on federal government personnel, who are not able to perform their duties during a Government Shutdown, to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of our products, process export licenses for us and perform other services for us that, when disrupted, may prevent us from timely shipping products outside the U.S.  If we are unable to timely ship our products outside the U.S., there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business.  Moreover, our inability to ship products, or the perception by customers that we might not be able to timely ship our products in the future, may cause such customers to look to foreign competitors to fulfill their demand.  If our customers look to foreign competitors to source equipment of the type we manufacture, there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business.Zero defect and other unfavorable provisions in government contracts, some of which are customary, may subject our business to material limitations, restrictions and uncertainties and may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.   Government contracts contain provisions that provide the U.S. government with substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions that allow the U.S. government to inspect our products and unilaterally determine whether additional work is required to be completed to remedy any deemed deficiencies; to terminate existing contracts, in whole or in part, for any reason or no reason; unilaterally reduce or modify the government’s obligations under such contracts without our consent; decline to exercise an option to continue a contract or exercise an option to purchase only the minimum amount, if any, specified in a contract; take actions that result in a longer development timeline than expected; and change the course of a program in a manner that differs from the contract’s original terms or from our desired plan. Generally, government contracts, including our contracts with the U.S. Navy, contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the U.S. government’s convenience. Under general principles of government contracting law, if the U.S. government terminates a contract for convenience, the government contractor may recover only its incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to the termination. If the U.S. government terminates a contract for default, the government contractor is entitled to recover costs incurred and associated profits on accepted items only and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the government in procuring undelivered items from another source. In addition, government contracts normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits, and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example, unilateral inspection rights and the requirement that we complete additional work to remedy any deemed deficiency; specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts; mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent; mandatory internal control systems and policies; and mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements. If we fail to maintain compliance with these requirements, we may be subject to potential contract liability and to termination of our government contracts. Furthermore, any agreements and subcontracts with third parties, including suppliers, consultants and other third-party contractors that we enter into in order to satisfy our contractual obligations pursuant to our agreements with the U.S. government must also be compliant with the terms of our government contract. Negotiating and entering into such arrangements can be time-consuming and we may not be able to reach agreement with such third parties. Any delay or inability to enter into such arrangements or entering into such arrangements in a manner that is non-compliant with the terms of our government contract, may result in violations of our contract. The markets we serve include the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. These industries are both highly cyclical in nature and dependent on the prices of crude oil and natural gas.  As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results. A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, and petroleum refining industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries.  These industries are highly cyclical, and are subject to the prices of crude oil and natural gas.  The prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically had periods when they have been very volatile, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in oil prices over the past few years such as the volatility related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war.  During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers often refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes and future demand projections are clearer.  If our customers refrain from placing orders with us, our revenue would decline and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 11 As a result of recent adverse supply-side and demand-side disruptions, our commercial customers in these markets confront competing budget priorities and may have more limited resources for the types of products and services we provide.  As a result, there may be fewer projects available for us to compete for and the pricing environment is anticipated to remain challenging. We believe that over the long-term, demand for our products will expand in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries.  A sustained deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production, and transitions in consumer demand toward different types of energy, may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others.  A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities.  A demand shift, where technological advances or consumer preferences favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact the demand for our products. Changes in consumer demand, including some driven by governmental and political preferences, toward electric, compressed natural gas, hydrogen vehicles and other alternative energy may impact our business. We have products which can support certain technologies, while other technologies will not require our equipment.  If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources.  For example, non-fossil based sources may receive government tax incentives to foster investment.  If these incentives become more prominent, our business and results of operations could suffer.Climate change and greenhouse gas regulations may affect our customers’ investment decisions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These restrictions may affect our customers' abilities and willingness to invest in new facilities or to re-invest in current operations. These requirements could impact the cost of our customers’ products, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower-carbon sources.  Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our future success may be affected by our current and future indebtedness.Under our loan agreements, as of March 31, 2022, we had $18,500 outstanding under our term loan with Bank of America, N.A (""Bank of America""). We may borrow additional funds in the future to support our growth and working capital needs. Pursuant to our loan agreements with Bank of America, we are required to provide financial information and reports while complying with other financial covenants. At December 31, 2021, we were out of compliance with our bank agreement covenants and were granted a waiver for noncompliance by Bank of America. Additionally, on March 31, 2022 and June 7, 2022, we entered into amendment agreements with Bank of America. These agreements placed additional restrictive covenants on the Company and increased our borrowing costs.  In the future, should we again be out of compliance with our bank agreement, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional waivers or renegotiate our credit facilities in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. If we were not able to obtain a covenant waiver under our debt facilities or renegotiate such facilities, we could be in default of such agreements, and in the event of such default our lender could demand immediate repayment of amounts outstanding. There can be no assurance that we would have sufficient cash, or be able to raise sufficient debt or equity capital, or divest assets, to refinance or repay such facility or facilities in the event of such demand. As a result, the failure to obtain covenant waivers or renegotiate our facilities as described above would have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to service our debt obligations.Our business is highly competitive.  If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.We encounter intense competition in all of our markets.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Certain competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us due to their geography or changes in relative currency values and may compete against us based on price.  This may affect our ability to secure new business and maintain our level of profitability.  As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers. 12 Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers. If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected.Customer focus on short-term costs versus prioritizing quality and brand recognition, could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.Although we have long-term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different.  Our customers have historically focused on the quality of the engineering and product solutions which we have provided to them, which may come at a higher cost.  Because our customers are unable to predict the length of the time period for the economic viability of their plants, there has been more of a focus on relative importance of cost versus quality which looks at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost of operations. In addition, customers in emerging markets which are driving global demand growth may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain other industrialized countries where we compete.  If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. A change in the structure of our markets, including through consolidation, could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.There are strong and long-standing relationships throughout the supply chain between the many parties involved in serving the end user of our products.  A change in the landscape between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain, and/or with the end users could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  These changes, or others, might occur through industry consolidations such as mergers, acquisitions or other business partnerships, and could have a material impact on our business and negatively impact our financial results. The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations. While we may have only one or two customers that represent over 10% of revenue in any one year, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales.  For example, sales to our top ten customers, who can vary each year, accounted for 42%, 63% and 48% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively.  We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future.  The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers, or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management.  We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, issues or liabilities, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our management’s attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisition’s existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business.  We also need to utilize key personnel who may be distracted from the core business.  If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition’s business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.We may not achieve all the intended benefits of the acquisition of BN and could subject us to unknown and unforeseen liabilities.We completed the acquisition of BN in June 2021 and have already begun experiencing many of the benefits from the acquisition. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize every intended benefit of the transaction.  There are many challenges associated with integrating an acquisition such as BN, including those associated with the integration of operations, retention of key management and other employees with historically different cultures and priorities, the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns while addressing integration matters, retaining existing business and operational relationships including customers, suppliers and others, unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems, as well as unforeseen expenses associated with the integration.In addition, BN may have unknown liabilities, including, but not limited to, product liability, workers’ compensation liability, tax liability and liability for improper business practices. Although we are entitled to indemnification from the sellers of BN for these 13 and other matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could incur material liabilities for the past activities of BN. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business or results of operations.We have foreign operations and a percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.For fiscal 2022, 20% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S. Moreover, through our subsidiaries, we maintain a sales office in China and a sales and market development office in India.  We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available.  Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:•nationalization of private enterprises and assets;•political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East and/or portions of the former Soviet Union;•the global economic impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or future global health concerns;•political relationships between the U.S. and certain countries and regions;•differences in foreign laws, including difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;•the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy;•credit risks;•currency fluctuations;•tariff and tax increases;•export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments; •shipping products during times of crisis or war;•our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; or•other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations.The impact of potential changes in customs and trade policies and tariffs imposed by the U.S. and those imposed in response by other countries, including China, as well as rapidly changing trade relations, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.The U.S. government has made proposals that are intended to address trade imbalances, which include encouraging increased production in the United States.  These proposals could result in increased customs duties and the renegotiation of some U.S. trade agreements.  Changes in U.S. and foreign governments’ trade policies have resulted and may continue to result in tariffs on imports into, and exports from, the U.S.  Over the past few years, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from several countries, including China, Canada, the European Union and Mexico.  In response, China, Canada and the European Union have proposed or implemented their own tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. into those countries.  Tariffs affecting our products and product components, including raw materials we use, particularly high-end steel and steel related products, may add significant costs to us and make our products more expensive.  Potential future changes in trade policies could result in customers changing their behavior in project procurement, due to uncertainty related to timely execution and/or import and export restrictions.  As a result, our products could become less attractive to customers outside the U.S. due to U.S. import tariffs on our raw materials and our profit margins would be negatively impacted.  Accordingly, continued tariffs may weaken relationships with certain trading partners and may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations. When beneficial to us, we may consider alternate sourcing options, including offshore subcontracting, in order to minimize the impact of the tariffs. Because we conduct aspects of our business in China through our subsidiary, potential reductions in trade with China and diminished relationships between China and the U.S., as well as the continued escalation of tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by China’s evolving economic, political and social conditions. We conduct our business in China primarily through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary.  The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China's political, economic and social conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and 14 regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases and changes in the rates or methods of taxation.  In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users.  Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or the operation of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China and India, which could harm our business. Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Similarly, proprietary information may not be afforded the same protection in India as it is in our other major markets with more comprehensive intellectual property laws.  Although we take precautions in the operations of our subsidiaries to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business.  We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.  There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China.  The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value.  Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform.  Moreover, the relative inexperience of China's judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas.  Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.  For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Regulation of foreign investment in India may adversely affect the operations of our Indian subsidiary.Our subsidiary in India is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in India.  India regulates ownership of Indian companies by foreign entities.  These regulations may apply to our funding of our Indian operating subsidiary.  For example, the government of India has set out criteria for foreign investments in India, including requirements with respect to downstream investments by Indian companies owned or controlled by foreign entities and the transfer of ownership or control of Indian companies in certain industries.  These requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate our Indian subsidiary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required approvals for future acquisitions, investments or operations in India, or that we will be able to obtain such approvals on satisfactory terms.Changes in U.S. and foreign energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business.Energy policy in the U.S. and other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur, as they may be related to changes in political administration, public policy or other factors.  The elimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.Near-term income statement impact from competitive contracts could adversely affect our operating results.During weaker market periods, we may choose to be more aggressive in pricing certain competitive projects to protect or gain market share or to increase the utilization of our facilities.  In these situations, it is possible that an incrementally profitable order, while increasing contribution, may be unprofitable from an accounting perspective when including fixed manufacturing costs.  In these situations, we are required to recognize the financial loss at the time of order acceptance, or as soon as our cost estimates are updated, whichever occurs first.  It is possible we may accumulate losses either on a large project or more than one project such that, in a short time period, for example a reporting quarter, these losses may have a meaningful impact on the earnings for that period.Our operating results could be adversely affected by customer contract cancellations and delays.Adverse economic or specific project conditions can lead to a project being placed on hold or cancelled by our customers.  We had no projects cancelled in fiscal 2022 or in fiscal 2021.  Similarly, we had no projects on hold at March 31, 2022. We attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred. As a result, we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled.  Open orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers.  If it becomes evident to us 15 that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date, management will move the project into ""placed on hold"" (i.e., suspended) category.  Furthermore, if a project is cancelled by our customer, it is removed from our backlog.The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2022 was $256,536.  Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders.  The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2022 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.  This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil.  We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future.  Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations.  Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results.Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy.  In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in this end market which offers large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base.  A delay, long-term extension or cancellation of any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Further, certain defense contracts we secure may be designated a program of highest national priority requiring production preference over commercial orders which could impact our commercial backlog and result in production delays.  As a result, commercial customers could seek damages, including liquidated damages, as performance penalties and there may be a negative impact to the willingness of customers to place future orders with us due to a concern that orders may be subordinated to such contracts.Our customers’ ability and willingness to make progress payments may be impacted by any extended downturn in their markets which could adversely impact their financial stability and increase the risk to us of uncollectable accounts receivables.                The financial strength of our customers can be impacted by a severe or lengthy downturn in their markets which could lead to additional risk in our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables. We attempt to mitigate this risk with the utilization of progress payments for many projects, but certain industries, end markets and geographies are not as willing to make progress payments. Certain projects require a small portion of the total payments to be held until the customer's facility is fully operational, which can be in excess of one year beyond our delivery of equipment to them.  This additional time may add risk to our ability to collect on the outstanding accounts receivables.Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contracts could negatively impact our results of operations. A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments by us to our customers.  While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, estimating errors, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes.  For example, in fiscal 2022, we experienced material cost overruns related to defense contracts at our Batavia, NY facility.  To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability may decrease or losses may be incurred which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  For our U.S. Navy projects, these fixed priced contracts have order to shipment periods which can exceed five years.  This additional time-based risk, which we believe is manageable, nevertheless increases the likelihood of cost fluctuation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.Given our size and specialization of our business, if we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense.  Moreover, our technology is highly specialized, and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel.  Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.  If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. During certain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities.  We could experience difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely affect our business.Our fabrication processes require highly skilled production workers, especially welders. Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas.  While we have an in-house weld training program, if we are unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number of individuals with high-end welding capability, this could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives.  In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly 16 outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workers could dramatically increase in our and related industries and that could affect our financial performance.  Furthermore, should we not be able to expand our production workforce, we would expect to increase the amount of outsourced fabrication which is likely to result in higher costs and lower margins. If we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of our products, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us.  For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage. In addition, BN produces certain products in large quantities which could also expose us to potential product liability claims.Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances.  Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and our historical experience may not reflect liabilities we may face in the future.  Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex or larger projects.  We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all.  Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us.  We may also incur significant warranty claims which are not covered by insurance.  In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer.  We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if we were found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer.  Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights.  Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based in U.S. dollars.  Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies.  Strength of the U.S. dollar compared with the Euro or Asian currencies may put us in a less competitive position.  Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified.  In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  At March 31, 2022, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business.  We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems. Threats to these systems, and the laws and regulations 17 governing security of data, including personal data, on information systems and otherwise held by companies is evolving and adding layers of complexity in the form of new requirements and increasing costs of attempting to protect information systems and data and complying with new cybersecurity regulations.  Information systems are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our information systems, computer technology, and business. Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information systems and computer technology to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats and ransomware.  The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.  A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions, ransom payments, and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations.  Further, our technology resources may be strained due to an increase in the number of remote users.  In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.  In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us.  For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination.  Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Many of our large international customers are nationalized or state-owned businesses.  Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations.We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions.  Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products.  While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible.  If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We presently have no intention to declare or pay a dividend, the terms of our indebtedness restrict our ability to pay dividends, and we may not be able to pay dividends in the future.In fiscal 2022, we suspended the dividend and presently have no intention to declare or pay a dividend. In addition, our loan agreement with Bank of America contains terms that restrict our ability to declare or pay dividends. Any determination by our Board of Directors regarding dividends will depend on a variety of factors, including our future financial performance, organic growth opportunities, general economic conditions and financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. There can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends in the future. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders' ability to change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Such provisions include:•We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.  Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock.  We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.18 •Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year.  This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors.•Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting.  Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.  •Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote.  In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction. •Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.  Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.  This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.  •Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting. Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.  This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board"

(""GVHTT""), located in Suzhou, China, and Graham India Private Limited (""GIPL""), located in Ahmedabad, India.  GVHTT provides sales and engineering support for us in the People’s Republic of China and management oversight throughout Southeast Asia.  GIPL serves as a sales and market development office focusing on the refining, petrochemical and fertilizer markets.  During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, Energy Steel & Supply Co. (""Energy Steel""), located in Lapeer, Michigan. On June 1, 2021, we acquired Barber-Nichols, Inc. (""BNI""), a privately-owned designer and manufacturer of turbomachinery products for the aerospace, cryogenic, defense and energy markets, located in Arvada, Colorado.  BNI has approximately 140 employees.  The acquisition includes BNI’s new, 43,000 square foot, state-of-the-art manufacturing plant which is part of their 96,000 square foot facility in Arvada, Colorado.  We believe that this acquisition will further our growth strategy through market and product diversification, broaden our offerings to the defense and energy markets and strengthen our presence in the defense sector. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1983 and are the successor to Graham Manufacturing Co., Inc., which was incorporated in New York in 1936.  Our stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ""GHM"".   Unless indicated otherwise, dollar figures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are reported in thousands.  Our Products, Customers and Markets Our products are used in a wide range of industrial process applications, primarily in energy and defense markets, including: •Petroleum Refining —conventional oil refining —oil sands extraction and upgrading •Defense - Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program —aircraft carrier program (CVN) —Virginia fast-attack submarine program (SSN) —Columbia ballistic submarine program (SSBN) —refueling and overhaul replacement equipment •Chemical and Petrochemical Processing —ethylene, methanol and nitrogen producing plants  —fertilizer plants —plastics, resins and fibers plants —downstream petrochemical plants —coal-to-chemicals plants —gas-to-liquids plants•Power Generation /Alternative Energy —biomass plants —cogeneration power plants —geothermal power plants —ethanol plants4  —fossil fuel plants•Other —oleo chemical plants —air conditioning and water heating systems —food processing plants —pharmaceutical plants —liquefied natural gas production facilities Our principal customers include end users of our products in their manufacturing, refining and power generation processes, large engineering companies that build installations for companies in such industries, and the original equipment manufacturers who combine our products with their equipment prior to its sale to end users.   Our products are sold by a team of sales engineers whom we employ directly as well as by independent sales representatives located worldwide.  There may be short periods of time, a fiscal year for example, where one customer may make up greater than 10% of our business.  However, if this occurs in multiple years, it is usually not the same customer or project over such a multi-year period.  Two customers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, which we refer to as fiscal 2021, while a different customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, which we refer to as fiscal 2020.  As a result of our diversification efforts to more extensively support the U.S. Navy, we have increased our domestic sales in 2021.  Over a business cycle in the energy markets, our domestic sales will generally range between 50% and 70% of total sales.  The mix of domestic and international sales can vary from year to year.   Our backlog at March 31, 2021 was $137,567 compared with $112,389 at March 31, 2020.Our Strengths Our core strengths include: •We have a value-enhancing sales and development platform.  We believe our customer-facing platform of sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages.  We have tools and capabilities that we believe allow us to move quickly and comprehensively as customers evaluate how best to integrate our equipment into their facilities.  We believe that our early and deep involvement adds significant value to the process and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve.  We believe customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in the project life cycle to understand how best to specify our equipment.   •We are renowned for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders.  The orders we receive are extremely complex and we believe that our order management platforms provide another competitive differentiator for our company.  In our markets, we believe that order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality and engineering documentation are as important as the equipment itself.  We have developed strong order management capabilities to enable us to deliver high quality, engineered-to-order and build-to-spec process-critical equipment in a timely manner.  For our customers’ complex, custom orders we typically manage very rigorous interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm, as product design and quality requirements are finalized once an order is received.  Customers’ supplier selection process begins by assessing these order management capabilities. •We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment.  We believe our operations platform is adept at handling low volume, high mix orders that are highly customized fabrications.  We also believe that our production environment is much different from a highly engineered standard products business.  While certain equipment in a product group may look similar, there are often subtle differences which are required to deliver the desired specification.  Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production.  The markets that we serve demand this flexible operating model. •We have the capability to manage outsourced production.  Effectively accessing the global fabrication supply chain expands our market reach, increases execution capacity and can improve competitiveness.  We use this capability for three primary reasons: 1. delivering a lower cost manufacturing option; 2. expanding capacity to execute an order to meet customer timing requirements and 3. addressing localized content requirements.  We have proven capability to deliver our specialized product designs with outsourced fabrication that is on-time, within budget and that meets our high quality standards.5 •We provide robust after-the-sale technical support.  Our engineering and performance improvement personnel go to customer sites to audit the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues.  Technical service after a sale is important to our customers as we believe their focus is always on leveraging our equipment to maximize their facilities’ productivity. •We have a highly trained workforce.  We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and extremely flexible workforce. •We have a strong balance sheet. We maintain significant cash and investments on hand, and no bank debt, which we believe provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue our business strategy, including growth by acquisition. On June 1, 2021 we utilized $41,150 of cash and investments to acquire BNI.  •We have a high-quality credit facility.  On March 31, 2021 our credit facilities provided $37,000 of borrowing capacity.   On June 1, 2021 we entered into new credit agreements which provide $57,500 of borrowing capacity, including a $20,000 term loan to acquire BNI.  We also reissued approximately 610 treasury shares with a value of approximately $8,963.Our Strategy We intend to strategically leverage and deploy our assets, including but not limited to, financial, technical, manufacturing and industry know-how, in order to capture expanded market share within the geographies and industries we serve, expand revenue opportunities in adjacent and countercyclical markets and continually improve our results of operations in order to: •Generate sustainable earnings growth;•Reduce earnings volatility;•Improve our operating performance;•Generate strong cash flow from operations to reinvest in our business or return to shareholders in the form of ordinarydividends; and •Provide an acceptable return to our shareholders.To accomplish our objectives and maintain strategic focus, we believe that we must: •Successfully deploy our corporate assets to expand our market share in the industries we currently serve, access and develop a stronger presence in industries where historically we have not had a strong presence, and pursue acquisitions, partnerships and/or other business combinations in order to enter new geographic or industrial markets, new product lines or expand our coverage in existing markets.   •Identify organic growth opportunities and consummate acquisitions where we believe the strength of the Graham brand will provide us with the ability to expand and complement our core businesses.  We intend to extend our existing product lines, move into complementary product lines and expand our global sales presence in order to further broaden our existing markets and reach additional markets. •Expand our market presence in the U.S. Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program.  We will continue to demonstrate our proficiency by successfully executing the complex Nuclear Propulsion Program orders that are currently in our backlog by controlling both cost and risk, providing high-quality custom fabrication to exacting military quality control requirements and through disciplined project management.  We intend to continue to be a preferred supplier of equipment to the U.S. Navy’s Nuclear Propulsion Program for both surface and submarine vessels. •Continue to invest in people and capital equipment to meet the long-term demand for our products in the oil refining, petrochemical processing and defense industries, especially in emerging geographic markets.   •Continue to deliver the highest quality products and solutions that enable our customers to achieve their operating objectives.  We believe that our high quality and technical expertise differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to win new orders based on value.In order to effectively implement our strategy, we also believe that we must continue to invest in and leverage our unique value enhancing differentiators, including:6 •Invest in engineering resources and technology in order to advance our vacuum and heat transfer technology market penetration. •Enhance our engineering capacity and capability, especially in connection with product design, in order to more quickly respond to existing and future customer demands and opportunities.   •Invest in our manufacturing operations to improve productivity where needed and identify out-sourced capacity to complement our growth strategies. •Accelerate our ability to quickly and efficiently bid on available projects through our ongoing implementation of front-end bid automation and design processes. •Invest in resources to further serve the U.S. Navy in our core competency areas of engineering and manufacturing, where our commercial capabilities meet U.S. Navy requirements. •Implement and expand upon our operational efficiencies through ongoing refinement of our flexible manufacturing flow model as well as achievement of other cost efficiencies.   •Focus on improving quality to eliminate errors and rework, thereby reducing lead time and enhancing productivity. •Further develop a cross-trained, flexible workforce able to adjust to variable product demands by our customers. •Consistently manage human resources to appropriately respond to market condition while striving to maintain our highly-trained workforce even in times of low demand for our products.  This may result in income statement pressure, however, it provides the capacity and capability to grow quickly as markets recover.COVID-19 Pandemic Impact                The COVID-19 pandemic began affecting our business, our customers’ businesses, and the markets we serve in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and has continued to rapidly evolve.  The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the already volatile oil industry and markets.  The pandemic impacted both our capital equipment sales as well as our short cycle business.              Our proactive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included approximately three weeks of limited production at our facility in Batavia, New York beginning in late March 2020.  We began bringing back our personnel early in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 and by June 2020, we had nearly all of our pre-COVID-19 pandemic headcount in our factory, subject to numerous new health and safety protocols as recommended by our federal and local authorities, including requiring appropriate personal protective equipment to be worn by everyone onsite, social distancing markers, staggered employee breaks and meetings to reduce group gatherings, expanded hygiene practices, and barriers as appropriate to separate workers based on our plant layout configuration.  We deployed numerous laptop computers to our sales, engineering, quality, supply chain, finance, and administrative personnel to facilitate remote work.  Throughout fiscal 2021, we limited external visitors to our Batavia facility and those few that were allowed were pre-approved and tested for COVID-19.  We continue to utilize certain pandemic response measures.  Our workforce safety and employee well-being continue to be top priorities and we remain committed to the service of our customers and suppliers.  For further information on the risks posed to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A - Risk Factors
 below, and our discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout this report.  Our first quarter operated at approximately 50% throughput capacity and during the third and fourth quarters at roughly 90% throughput capacity due to the measures taken to protect employees from the spread of COVID-19.CompetitionOur business is highly competitive.  The principal bases on which we compete include technology, price, performance, reputation, delivery, and quality.  Our competitors listed in alphabetical order by market include: 7 North America Market Principal Competitors   Refining vacuum distillation Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH   Chemicals/petrochemicals Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; Schutte Koerting   Turbomachinery Original Equipment Manufacturer (""OEM"") – refining, petrochemical Donghwa Entec Co., Ltd.; KEMCO; Oeltechnik GmbH   Turbomachinery OEM – power and power producer  Holtec; KEMCO; Maarky Thermal Systems; Thermal Engineering International (USA), Inc.   Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program / Defense DC Fabricators; Joseph Oat; PCC; Triumph Aerospace; Xylem international Market Principal Competitors   Refining vacuum distillation Edwards, Ltd.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH; Korting Hannover AG   Chemicals/petrochemicals Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Edwards, Ltd.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH; Korting Hannover AG; Schutte Koerting   Turbomachinery OEM – refining, petrochemical Chem Process Systems; Donghwa Entec Co., Ltd.; Hangzhou Turbine Equipment Co., Ltd.; KEMCO; Mazda (India);  Oeltechnik GmbH   Turbomachinery OEM – power and power producer Chem Process Systems; Holtec; KEMCO; Mazda (India);SPX Heat Transfer; Thermal Engineering International Intellectual PropertyOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  We also depend heavily on the brand recognition of the Graham name in the marketplace. Availability of Raw MaterialsHistorically, we have not been materially adversely impacted by the availability of raw materials.Working Capital PracticesOur business does not require us to carry significant amounts of inventory or materials beyond what is needed for work in process.  We negotiate progress payments from our customers on our large projects to finance costs incurred.  We do not provide rights to return goods, or payment terms to customers that we consider to be extended in the context of the industries we serve.  We do provide for warranty claims.Environmental MattersWe believe that we are in material compliance with applicable existing environmental laws and regulations.  We do not anticipate that our compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of material in the environment or otherwise pertaining to the protection of the environment will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. SeasonalityNo material part of our business is seasonal in nature.  However, our business is highly cyclical in nature as it depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in major capital projects.8Research and Development ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we spent $3,367, $3,353 and $3,538, respectively, on research and development (""R&D"") activities.  The majority of our R&D is application specific to help solve our customers’ problems in order to improve efficiencies, address challenging environments or caustic materials, or redesign for form and function.  We may be engineering new products and services for our customers.  We also continually look to improve existing products and services. EmployeesAs of March 31, 2021, we had 331 employees.  We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. Available Information We maintain a website located at www.graham-mfg.com.  On our website, we provide a link to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the ""SEC"") website that contains the reports, proxy statements and other information we file electronically.  Printed copies of all documents we file with the SEC are available free of charge for any stockholder who makes a request.  Such requests should be made to our Corporate Secretary at our corporate headquarters.  The other information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. 9Item 1A.       Risk Factors
 Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations. Risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemicOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected if the COVID-19 pandemic, or another global health crisis, impacts our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others’ ability to conduct business or negatively affects consumer and business confidence or the global economy. The COVID-19 health crisis has affected large segments of the global economy, including the markets we operate in. The COVID-19 pandemic began affecting our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.The pandemic and any additional preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business or our suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, restrictions on shipping, fabricating or installing products, reduced consumer demand or customers’ ability to make payments.  We have and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to increased challenges with our workforce (including as a result of illness, absenteeism or government orders), implementing further precautionary measures to protect the health of our workforce, increased project cancellations or projects put on hold, access to supplies, capital, and fundamental support services (such as shipping and transportation).  Any resulting financial impact cannot be fully estimated at this time, but may materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, among others.Due to a potential COVID-19 reduction in throughput capacity, certain contracts in our backlog may experience delayed shipment.  We accept contracts that contain provisions for a buyer to recover liquidated damages if our delivery is past contractual delivery dates, and such liquidated damages claimed by a customer could adversely affect financial performance.  The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors
, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.  The situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact continues to change rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are presently unaware of. The COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt and cause delays in our supply chains, and such disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.The raw materials that we source come from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial results.  It is possible that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could cause a disruption in our supply chain.  If that supply chain is disrupted for an extended period of time, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic or another global health crisis, our ability to meet customer requirements and achieve our financial performance may be affected.  We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain, but we are maintaining ongoing communications with our suppliers to monitor their status.  Any disruption to our supply chain could negatively impact our operations and financial performance.Disruption to the global oil markets, including from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our customers’ and our own results of operations and financial performance.Our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition, or that of our customers, may be adversely affected by significant decreases in demand for oil resulting from global restrictions on travel, work from home practices, and the significant reduction in industrial and commercial activity, or an increase in operating costs as a result of the global business disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or that may result from a future global health crisis.  Global oil markets continue to experience significant volatility and had dramatic declines in prices in fiscal 2021 due to decreased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from government-led “stay-at-home” orders and social distancing initiatives and a geopolitical imbalance of supply.  Demand for some of our products is dependent on the level of expenditures by our customers in the oil and gas industry.  Accordingly, continued volatility or downturns in the oil markets, and potential project cancellations, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. 10 The COVID-19 pandemic may impact businesses differently across various regions. We operate and compete globally. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic by domestic and foreign governments has been and may continue to be varied and those differences may impact our competitiveness.  Our operating subsidiaries are located in China and India, and those countries’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have varied from the United States’ response.  There are uncertain political climates in the regions where our subsidiaries operate, and governmental action in those regions may result in the temporary closure or limited operations of our subsidiaries.  Government assistance during a pandemic may also differ between private and public companies, which may provide an advantage to one compared with another.  This may affect our competitive position and could disrupt the market access and success of our business compared with other current or new competitors.  This impact could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.COVID-19 disruption could impact our management team due to illness from the pandemic.Our business has specialized management, technical and sales personnel who may become unavailable for an extended period or lost due to the effect of COVID-19 or another pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic may significantly disrupt our workforce if a significant percentage of our employees are unable to work due to illness or quarantines.  In addition, COVID-19-related illness could impact members of our Board of Directors, resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors, making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full Board of Directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.  Any of the loss of personnel or disruption in management as described above could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Risks related to our business The markets we serve include the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. These industries are both highly cyclical in nature and dependent on the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as on the differential between the two prices.  As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, and petroleum refining industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries.  These industries are highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns.  The prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically had periods when they have been very volatile, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in oil prices over the past few years and, in particular, volatility related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers often refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes and future demand projections are clearer.  If our customers refrain from placing orders with us, our revenue would decline and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  The ongoing slowdown in our energy and petrochemical markets that began during the latter part of fiscal 2020, and was caused primarily by an excess supply of crude oil, had a negative impact on commodity pricing which resulted in more measured investment in maintenance and capital projects within these markets.  The economic slowdown and corresponding reductions in demand for transportation fuel and petrochemical products caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic further adversely affected these markets.  As a result of these combined adverse supply-side and demand-side disruptions, our commercial customers in these markets have significantly reduced their operating budgets for the types of products and services we provide.  The timing and catalyst for a recovery in these markets remains uncertain.  Accordingly, we believe that in the near term the quantity of projects available for us to compete for will be fewer and that the pricing environment will remain challenging.We believe that over the long-term, demand for our products will expand in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries.  A sustained deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.  As we have seen in the recent past, a cyclical downturn can occur suddenly and result in extremely different financial performance sequentially from quarter to quarter or on an annual comparative basis due to an inability to rapidly adjust costs.The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others.  A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities going forward and the profitability of those opportunities.  A demand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact the demand for our products.  If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources.  For example, non-fossil based sources may receive government tax incentives to foster investment.  If these incentives become more prominent, our business and results of operations could suffer.11 A transition toward different types of energy may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Changes in consumer demand, including some driven by governmental and political preferences, toward electric, compressed natural gas, hydrogen vehicles and other alternative energy may impact our business.  We have products which can support certain technologies, while other technologies will not require our equipment.  A significant change in demand for oil and gas based products may have a material adverse impact on our business.Climate change and greenhouse gas regulations may affect our customers’ investment decisions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These restrictions may affect our customers' abilities and willingness to invest in new facilities or to re-invest in current operations.  These requirements could impact the cost of our customers’ products, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower-carbon sources.  Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Our business is highly competitive.  If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.We encounter intense competition in all of our markets.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources.  Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Certain competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us due to their geography or changes in relative currency values and may compete against us based on price.  This may affect our ability to secure new business and maintain our level of profitability.  As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers.  Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers.  If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected.A change in our end use customers, our markets, or a change in the engineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.Although we have long-term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different.  Our customers have historically focused on the quality of the engineering and product solutions which we have provided to them.  Because our customers are unable to predict the length of the time period for the economic viability of their plants, there has been more of a focus on relative importance of cost versus quality which looks at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost of operations.A change in the structure of our markets; the relationships between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain and any of their relationships with the end users could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.There are strong and long-standing relationships throughout the supply chain between the many parties involved in serving the end user of our products.  A change in the landscape between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain, including disruptions in the supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or with the end users could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  These changes, or others, might occur through acquisitions or other business partnerships and could have a material impact on our business and negatively impact our financial results. The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations. While we may have only one or two customers represent over 10% of revenue in any one year, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales.  For example, sales to our top ten customers, who can vary each year, accounted for 63%, 48% and 41% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, respectively.  We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future.  The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers, or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.12 Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions.  In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management.  We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, issues or liabilities, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our management’s attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting.  Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisition’s existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business.  We also need to utilize key personnel who may be distracted from the core business.  If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition’s business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.If we fail to successfully integrate BNI’s operations, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.On June 1, 2021, we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire BNI, a privately-owned designer and manufacturer of turbomachinery products for the aerospace, cryogenic, defense and energy markets, located in Arvada, Colorado, for approximately $70,000.  We may not realize every intended benefit of the acquisition which could adversely impact our results of operations.  There are many challenges associated with integrating an acquisition such as BNI, including those associated with the integration of operations, retention of key management and other employees with historically different cultures and priorities, the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns while addressing integration matters, retaining existing business and operational relationships including customers, suppliers and others, unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems, as well as unforeseen expenses associated with the integration.  Further, our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage the expanded scope of our operations as a result of our acquisition of BNI.We may experience customer concentration risk related to strategic growth for U.S. Navy projects.We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities may lead to U.S. Navy related projects consistently being greater than 10% of our total revenue.  While these projects are spread across multiple contractors for the U.S. Navy, the end customer for these projects is the same.  This concentration of business could add additional risk to us should there be a disruption, short or long term, in the funding for these projects or our participation in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion program.The size of our contracts with the U.S. Navy may produce volatility over the short term financial results.We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities, which are often much larger contracts than our commercial contracts, may impact our ability to effectively provide accurate investor guidance for our near term financial results.  These contracts can, on occasion, be delayed before or during the revenue recognition cycle.  If we are unable to reallocate the resources to other projects, we may see an increase in volatility in our near term financial results.A significant percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.For fiscal 2021, 46% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S.  Moreover, through our subsidiaries, we maintain a sales office in China and a sales and market development office in India.  We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available.  Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of: •nationalization of private enterprises and assets; •political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East and/or portions of the former Soviet Union; •the global economic impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic •political relationships between the U.S. and certain countries and regions; •differences in foreign laws, including difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights; •the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy;13 •credit risks; •currency fluctuations; •tariff and tax increases; •export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;  •shipping products during times of crisis or war; •our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; or •other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations.The impact of potential changes in customs and trade policies and tariffs imposed by the U.S. and those imposed in response by other countries, including China, as well as rapidly changing trade relations, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.The U.S. government has made proposals that are intended to address trade imbalances, which include encouraging increased production in the United States.  These proposals could result in increased customs duties and the renegotiation of some U.S. trade agreements.  Changes in U.S. and foreign governments’ trade policies have resulted and may continue to result in tariffs on imports into, and exports from, the U.S.  Over the past few years, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from several countries, including China, Canada, the European Union and Mexico.  In response, China, Canada and the European Union have proposed or implemented their own tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. into those countries.  Tariffs affecting our products and product components, including raw materials we use, particularly high-end steel and steel related products, may add significant costs to us and make our products more expensive.  Potential future changes in trade policies could result in customers changing their behavior in project procurement, due to uncertainty related to timely execution and/or import and export restrictions.  As a result, our products could become less attractive to customers outside the U.S. due to U.S. import tariffs on our raw materials and our profit margins would be negatively impacted.  Accordingly, continued tariffs may weaken relationships with certain trading partners and may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.  When beneficial to us, we may consider alternate sourcing options, including off shore subcontracting, in order to minimize the impact of the tariffs.  Because we conduct aspects of our business in China through our subsidiary, potential reductions in trade with China and diminished relationships between China and the U.S., including as a result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the continued escalation of tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Global demand growth could be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins and increased competition.An increase in global demand could be led by emerging markets.  If this is the case, we may face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products.  Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain other industrialized countries where we compete.  If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by China’s evolving economic, political and social conditions. We conduct our business in China primarily through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary.  The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China's political, economic and social conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases and changes in the rates or methods of taxation.  In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users.  Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or the operation of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China and India, which could harm our business. Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter.  Similarly, proprietary information may not be afforded the same protection in India as it is in our other major markets with more comprehensive intellectual property laws.  Although we take precautions in the operations of our subsidiaries to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture 14of products that we undertake could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business.  We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.  There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China.  The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value.  Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform.  Moreover, the relative inexperience of China's judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas.  Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.  For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Regulation of foreign investment in India may adversely affect the operations of our Indian subsidiary.Our subsidiary in India is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in India.  India regulates ownership of Indian companies by foreign entities.  These regulations may apply to our funding of our Indian operating subsidiary.  For example, the government of India has set out criteria for foreign investments in India, including requirements with respect to downstream investments by Indian companies owned or controlled by foreign entities and the transfer of ownership or control of Indian companies in certain industries.  These requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate our Indian subsidiary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required approvals for future acquisitions, investments or operations in India, or that we will be able to obtain such approvals on satisfactory terms.Changes in U.S. and foreign energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business.Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur, as they may be related to changes in political administration, public policy or other factors.  The elimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks or shifts in focus in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S.  In recent years, the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful.  The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding.  A disruption in funding could adversely impact our business.One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy-related opportunities.  Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders.  The time between the awarding of an order to the completion of shipment can take three to seven years.  Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment.  Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue our production activity on these orders.  For example, the emergency spending bills related to the COVID-19 pandemic could compound the uncertainty already present in government funded programs.  Since this business is expected to increase as a percentage of our overall business, such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.Changes in the competitive environment for U.S. Navy procurement could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Over the past few years, we have expanded our business and the opportunities where we bid related to U.S. Navy projects.  This has increased our market share and caused an adverse share position for some of our competitors for these products.  Competitor response to our market penetration is possible.  Our customers may also raise concerns about their supplier concentration issues and the risk exposure related to this concentration.  As the U.S. Navy is looking to expand its fleet, there is also a risk that their facilities, 15their supply chain or our supply chain for raw materials, may not be able to support this expansion.  This could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Contract liabilities for large U.S. Navy contracts may be beyond our normal insurance coverage and a claim could have an adverse impact on our financial results.We are diligent at managing ongoing risks related to projects and the requirements of our customers.  Our history at managing risk provides significant evidence that our exposure and risk are minimal.  In addition, we secure business insurance coverage to minimize the impact of a major failure or liability related to our customers.  Due to certain U.S. government procurement policies, we may take on the risk of a liability for large U.S. Navy projects in excess of our insurance coverage and at a level which is higher than our commercial projects.  A claim related to one of these projects could have an adverse impact on our financial results.New technology used by the ships for the U.S. Navy may delay projects and may impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Certain U.S. Navy vessels are implementing new technologies, unrelated to any of the equipment that we provide.  If there is a complication or delay to any ship caused by this new technology, it may delay the procurement and fabrication of future vessels, which could have a negative impact on our business.Lapses in U.S. government appropriations have occurred, and any future lapses could disrupt U.S. export processing and related procedures and, as a result, may materially and adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and business.The U.S. has previously experienced lapses in federal appropriations, which had, in the past, a short-term effect on our business.  Any such future lapse (each, a ""Government Shutdown"") could negatively affect our ability to ship finished products to customers.  We rely on federal government personnel, who are not able to perform their duties during a Government Shutdown, to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of our products, process export licenses for us and perform other services for us that, when disrupted, may prevent us from timely shipping products outside the U.S.  If we are unable to timely ship our products outside the U.S., there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business.  Moreover, our inability to ship products, or the perception by customers that we might not be able to timely ship our products in the future, may cause such customers to look to foreign competitors to fulfill their demand.  If our customers look to foreign competitors to source equipment of the type we manufacture, there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business.Near-term income statement impact from competitive contracts could adversely affect our operating results.During weaker market periods, we may choose to be more aggressive in pricing certain competitive projects to protect or gain market share or to increase the utilization of our facilities.  In these situations, it is possible that an incrementally profitable order, while increasing contribution, may be unprofitable from an accounting perspective when including fixed manufacturing costs.  In these situations, we are required to recognize the financial loss at the time of order acceptance, or as soon as our cost estimates are updated, whichever occurs first.  It is possible we may accumulate losses either on a large project or more than one project such that, in a short time period, for example, a reporting quarter, these losses may have a meaningful impact on the earnings of the period.Our operating results could be adversely affected by customer contract cancellations and delays.Adverse economic or specific project conditions can lead to a project being placed on hold or cancelled by our customers.  While in fiscal 2021 we had no projects cancelled, in fiscal 2020 we had two projects cancelled.  Similarly, while at March 31, 2021 we had no projects on hold, at March 31, 2020 we had two projects on hold.  We attempt to mitigate the risk of cancellation by structuring contracts with our customers to maximize the likelihood that progress payments made to us for individual projects cover the costs we have incurred.  As a result, we do not believe we have a significant cash exposure to projects which may be cancelled.  Open orders are reviewed continuously through communications with customers.  If it becomes evident to us that a project is delayed well beyond its original shipment date, management will move the project into ""placed on hold"" (i.e., suspended) category.  Furthermore, if a project is cancelled by our customer, it is removed from our backlog.The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2021 was $137,567.  Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders.  The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2021 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales.  Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.  This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil.  We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may increase the risk of such cancellations.  Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations.  Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results.16Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy.  In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in this end market which offers large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base.  A delay, long-term extension or cancellation of any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Further, certain defense contracts we secure may be designated a program of highest national priority requiring production preference over commercial orders which could impact our commercial backlog and result in production delays.  As a result, commercial customers could seek damages, including liquidated damages, as performance penalties and there may be a negative impact to the willingness of customers to place future orders with us due to a concern that orders may be subordinated to such contracts.An extended downturn could adversely impact the financial stability of our customers and increase the risk of uncollectable accounts receivables.Our customers participate in cyclical markets, such as petroleum refining, petrochemicals and alternate energy.  The financial strength of our customers can be impacted by a severe or lengthy downturn in these markets, including any downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  This could lead to additional risk in our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables.  We attempt to mitigate this risk with the utilization of progress payments for many projects, but certain industries, end markets and geographies are not as willing to make progress payments.  Certain projects require a small portion of the total payments to be held until the customer's facility is fully operational, which can be in excess of one year beyond our delivery of equipment to them.  This additional time may add risk to our ability to collect on the outstanding accounts receivables.Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contracts could negatively impact our results of operations. A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments by us to our customers.  While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, estimating errors, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes.  To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability may decrease or losses may be incurred which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  For our U.S. Navy projects, these fixed priced contracts have order to shipment periods which can exceed five years.  This additional time-based risk, which we believe is manageable, nevertheless increases the likelihood of cost fluctuation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.Given our size and specialization of our business, if we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense.  Moreover, our technology is highly specialized, and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel.  Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.  If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  During certain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities.  We could experience difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely affect our business.Our fabrication processes require highly skilled production workers, especially welders.  Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas.  While we have an in-house weld training program, if we are unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number of individuals with high-end welding capability, this could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives.  In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workers could dramatically increase in our and related industries and that could affect our financial performance.  Furthermore, should we not be able to expand our production workforce, we would expect to increase the amount of outsourced fabrication which is likely to result in higher costs and lower margins.  If we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of our products, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us.  For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the 17misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage.Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances.  Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and our historical experience may not reflect liabilities we may face in the future.  Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex or larger projects.  We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all.  Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us.  We may also incur significant warranty claims which are not covered by insurance.  In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer.  We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if we were found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer.  Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights.  Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars, and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates has generally increased in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies.  Strength of the U.S. dollar compared with the Euro or Asian currencies may put us in a less competitive position.  At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. dollar saw relative strengthening in relation to the Euro and Asian currencies, however, as the pandemic has continued, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar has increased in volatility.  Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified.  In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  At March 31, 2021, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business.  We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems.  Threats to these systems, and the laws and regulations governing security of data, including personal data, on information systems and otherwise held by companies is evolving and adding layers of complexity in the form of new requirements and increasing costs of attempting to protect information systems and data and complying with new cybersecurity regulations.  Information systems are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our information systems, computer technology, and business.  Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information systems and computer technology to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats.  18The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.  A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations.  Further, our technology resources may be strained due to the increase in the number of remote users in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.  In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us.  For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination.  Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Many of our large international customers are nationalized or state-owned businesses.  Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations.We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions.  Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products.  While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible.  If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders' ability to change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Such provisions include: •We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms averse to our common stock.  Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock.  We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. •Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year.  This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors. •Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting.  Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.   •Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote.  In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction. 19 •Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.  Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.  This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.   •Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.  Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.  This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board"

(""GVHTT""), located in Suzhou, China, and Graham India Private Limited (""GIPL""), located in Ahmedabad, India.  GVHTT provides sales and engineering support for us in the People’s Republic of China and management oversight throughout Southeast Asia.  GIPL serves as a sales and market development office focusing on the refining, petrochemical and fertilizer markets. On June 24, 2019, we sold our wholly-owned subsidiary, Energy Steel & Supply Co. (""Energy Steel""), located in Lapeer, Michigan, which served the commercial nuclear utility industry. We were incorporated in Delaware in 1983 and are the successor to Graham Manufacturing Co., Inc., which was incorporated in New York in 1936.  Our stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ""GHM"".   Unless indicated otherwise, dollar figures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are reported in thousands. Our Products, Customers and Markets Our products are used in a wide range of industrial process applications, primarily in energy markets, including: •Petroleum Refining —conventional oil refining —oil sands extraction and upgrading •Defense  —propulsion systems for nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines •Chemical and Petrochemical Processing —ethylene, methanol and nitrogen producing plants  —fertilizer plants —plastics, resins and fibers plants —downstream petrochemical plants —coal-to-chemicals plants —gas-to-liquids plants•Power Generation /Alternative Energy —biomass plants —cogeneration power plants —geothermal power plants —ethanol plants —fossil fuel plants•Other —oleo chemical plants —air conditioning and water heating systems —food processing plants —pharmaceutical plants —liquefied natural gas production facilities 3Our principal customers include end users of our products in their manufacturing, refining and power generation processes, large engineering companies that build installations for companies in such industries, and the original equipment manufacturers who combine our products with their equipment prior to its sale to end users.   Our products are sold by a team of sales engineers we employ directly as well as by independent sales representatives located worldwide.  There may be short periods of time, a fiscal year for example, where one customer may make up greater than 10% of our business.  However, if this occurs in multiple years, it is usually not the same customer or project over such a multi-year period.  One customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, which we refer to as fiscal 2020, while a different customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, which we refer to as fiscal 2019.  As a result of our diversification efforts to more extensively support the U.S. Navy, we have increased our domestic sales in 2020.  Over a business cycle, our domestic sales will generally range between 50% and 75% of total sales.  The mix of domestic and international sales can vary from year to year.   Our backlog at March 31, 2020 was $112,389 compared with $132,127 at March 31, 2019.  Included in the March 31, 2019 backlog was $8,039 for the commercial nuclear utility business, which was sold in June 2019.Our Strengths Our core strengths include: •We have a value-enhancing sales and development platform.  We believe our customer-facing platform of sales, project estimating and application engineering are competitive advantages.  We have tools and capabilities that we believe allow us to move quickly and comprehensively as customers evaluate how best to integrate our equipment into their facilities.  We believe that our early and deep involvement adds significant value to the process and is an important competitive differentiator in the long sales cycle industries we serve.  We believe customers need our engineering and fabrication expertise early in the project life cycle to understand how best to specify our equipment.   •We are renowned for our strong capabilities to handle complex, custom orders.  The orders we receive are extremely complex and we believe that our order management platforms provide another competitive differentiator for our company.  In our markets, we believe that order administration, risk management, cost containment, quality and engineering documentation are as important as the equipment itself.  We have developed strong order management capabilities to enable us to deliver high quality, engineered-to-order and build-to-spec process-critical equipment in a timely manner.  For our customers’ complex, custom orders we typically manage very rigorous interaction between our project management teams and the end user or its engineering firm, as product design and quality requirements are finalized once an order is received.  Customers’ supplier selection process begins by assessing these order management capabilities. •We maintain a responsive, flexible production environment.  We believe our operations platform is adept at handling low volume, high mix orders that are highly customized fabrications.  We also believe that our production environment is much different from a highly engineered standard products business.  While certain equipment in a product group may look similar, there are often subtle differences which are required to deliver the desired specification.  Also, during production it is not uncommon for customer-driven engineering changes to occur that alter the configuration of what had been initially released into production.  The markets that we serve demand this flexible operating model. •We have the capability to manage outsourced production.  Effectively accessing the global fabrication supply chain expands our market reach, increases execution capacity and can improve competitiveness.  We use this capability for three primary reasons: 1. Delivering a lower cost manufacturing option; 2. Expanding capacity to execute an order to meet customer timing requirements and 3. Addressing localized content requirements.  We have proven capability to deliver our specialized product designs with outsourced fabrication that is on-time, within budget and that meets our high quality standards. •We provide robust after-the-sale technical support.  Our engineering and performance improvement personnel go to customer sites to audit the performance of our equipment, provide operator training and troubleshoot performance issues.  Technical service after a sale is important to our customers as we believe their focus is always on leveraging our equipment to maximize their facilities’ productivity.4 •We have a highly trained workforce.  We maintain a long-tenured, highly skilled and extremely flexible workforce. •We have a strong balance sheet. We maintain significant cash and investments on hand, and no bank debt, which we believe provides us with the financial flexibility to pursue our business strategy, including growth by acquisition. •We have a high-quality credit facility.  Our credit facilities provide us with a $35,000 borrowing capacity that is expandable at our option to provide us with up to a total of $60,000 in borrowing capacity.Our Strategy We intend to strategically leverage and deploy our assets, including but not limited to, financial, technical, manufacturing and industry know-how, in order to capture expanded market share within the geographies and industries we serve, expand revenue opportunities in adjacent and countercyclical markets and continually improve our results of operations in order to: •Generate sustainable earnings growth;•Reduce earnings volatility;•Improve our operating performance;•Generate strong cash flow from operations to reinvest in our business or return to shareholders in the form of ordinarydividends; and •Provide an acceptable return to our shareholders.To accomplish our objectives and maintain strategic focus, we believe that we must: •Successfully deploy our corporate assets to expand our market share in the industries we currently serve, access and develop a stronger presence in industries where we do not have a historically strong presence, and pursue acquisitions, partnerships and/or other business combinations in order to enter new geographic or industrial markets, new product lines or expand our coverage in existing markets.   •Identify organic growth opportunities and consummate acquisitions where we believe the strength of the Graham brand will provide us with the ability to expand and complement our core businesses.  We intend to extend our existing product lines, move into complementary product lines and expand our global sales presence in order to further broaden our existing markets and reach additional markets. •Expand our market presence in the U.S. Navy's Nuclear Propulsion Program.  We will continue to demonstrate our proficiency by successfully executing the complex Nuclear Propulsion Program orders that are currently in our backlog by controlling both cost and risk, providing high-quality custom fabrication to exacting military quality control requirements and through disciplined project management.  We intend to continue to be a preferred supplier of equipment to the U.S. Navy’s Nuclear Propulsion Program for both surface and submarine vessels. •Continue to invest in people and capital equipment to meet the long-term demand for our products in the oil refining, petrochemical processing and defense industries, especially in emerging geographic markets.   •Continue to deliver the highest quality products and solutions that enable our customers to achieve their operating objectives.  We believe that our high quality and technical expertise differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to win new orders based on value.In order to effectively implement our strategy, we also believe that we must continue to invest in and leverage our unique value enhancing differentiators, including: •Invest in engineering resources and technology in order to advance our vacuum and heat transfer technology market penetration. •Enhance our engineering capacity and capability, especially in connection with product design, in order to more quickly respond to existing and future customer demands and opportunities.   •Invest in our manufacturing operations to improve productivity where needed and identify out-sourced capacity to complement our growth strategies.5 •Accelerate our ability to quickly and efficiently bid on available projects through our ongoing implementation of front-end bid automation and design processes. •Invest in resources to further serve the U.S. Navy in our core competency areas of engineering and manufacturing, where our commercial capabilities meet U.S. Navy requirements. •Implement and expand upon our operational efficiencies through ongoing refinement of our flexible manufacturing flow model as well as achievement of other cost efficiencies.   •Focus on improving quality to eliminate errors and rework, thereby reducing lead time and enhancing productivity. •Further develop a cross-trained, flexible workforce able to adjust to variable product demands by our customers.COVID-19 Pandemic Impact                In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic began affecting our business, our customers’ businesses, and the markets we serve in the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2020.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the already volatile oil industry and markets.  The pandemic has impacted both our capital equipment sales as well as our short cycle business.              Our proactive measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic included approximately three weeks of limited production at our facility in Batavia, New York beginning in late March 2020.  As of June 2020, we are nearing our pre-COVID-19 pandemic headcount in our factory, subject to numerous new health and safety protocols as recommended by our federal and local authorities, including requiring appropriate personal protective equipment to be worn by everyone onsite, social distancing markers, staggered employee breaks and meetings to reduce group gatherings, expanded hygiene practices, and barriers as appropriate to separate workers based on our plant layout configuration.  We have deployed numerous laptop computers to our sales, engineering, quality, supply chain, finance, and administrative personnel to facilitate remote work.  We are limiting external visitors to our Batavia facility and those few that are being allowed must be pre-approved.  As we have and continue to implement pandemic response measures, workforce safety and employee well-being continue to be top priorities and we remain committed to the service of our customers and suppliers.  For further information on the risks posed to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A - Risk Factors
 below, and our discussion of COVID-19 throughout this report.CompetitionOur business is highly competitive.  The principal bases on which we compete include technology, price, performance, reputation, delivery, and quality.  Our competitors listed in alphabetical order by market include: North America Market Principal Competitors   Refining vacuum distillation Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH   Chemicals/petrochemicals Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; Schutte Koerting   Turbomachinery Original Equipment Manufacturer (""OEM"") – refining, petrochemical Donghwa Entec Co., Ltd.; KEMCO; Oeltechnik GmbH   Turbomachinery OEM – power and power producer  Holtec; KEMCO; Maarky Thermal Systems; Thermal Engineering International (USA), Inc.   Navy Nuclear Propulsion Program / Defense DC Fabricators; Joseph Oat; PCC; Triumph Aerospace; Xylem international Market Principal Competitors   Refining vacuum distillation Edwards, Ltd.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH; Korting Hannover AG   Chemicals/petrochemicals Croll Reynolds Company, Inc.; Edwards, Ltd.; Gardner Denver, Inc.; GEA Wiegand GmbH; Korting Hannover AG; Schutte Koerting6   Turbomachinery OEM – refining, petrochemical Chem Process Systems; Donghwa Entec Co., Ltd.; Hangzhou Turbine Equipment Co., Ltd.; KEMCO; Mazda (India);  Oeltechnik GmbH   Turbomachinery OEM – power and power producer Chem Process Systems; Holtec; KEMCO; Mazda (India);SPX Heat Transfer; Thermal Engineering International Intellectual PropertyOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technologies.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and contractual confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  We also depend heavily on the brand recognition of the Graham name in the marketplace. Availability of Raw MaterialsHistorically, we have not been materially adversely impacted by the availability of raw materials.Working Capital PracticesOur business does not require us to carry significant amounts of inventory or materials beyond what is needed for work in process.  We negotiate progress payments from our customers on our large projects to finance costs incurred.  We do not provide rights to return goods, or payment terms to customers that we consider to be extended in the context of the industries we serve.  We do provide for warranty claims.Environmental MattersWe believe that we are in material compliance with applicable existing environmental laws and regulations.  We do not anticipate that our compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of material in the environment or otherwise pertaining to the protection of the environment will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. SeasonalityNo material part of our business is seasonal in nature.  However, our business is highly cyclical in nature as it depends on the willingness of our customers to invest in major capital projects.Research and Development ActivitiesDuring fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, we spent $3,353, $3,538 and $3,211, respectively, on research and development (R&D) activities.  The majority of our R&D is application specific to help solve our customers’ problems in order to improve efficiencies, address challenging environments or caustic materials, or redesign for form and function.  We may be engineering new products and services for our customers.  We also continually look to improve existing products and services. EmployeesAs of March 31, 2020, we had 337 employees.  We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. Available Information We maintain a website located at www.graham-mfg.com.  On our website, we provide a link to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (the ""SEC"") website that contains the reports, proxy statements and other information we file electronically.  We do not provide this information on our website because it is more cost effective for us to provide a link to the SEC's website.  Printed copies of all documents we file with the SEC are available free of charge for any stockholder who makes a request.  Such requests should be made to our Corporate Secretary at our corporate headquarters.  The other information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. 7Item 1A.       Risk Factors
 Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations. Risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic:Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health pandemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic.Our business, financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected if the COVID-19 pandemic, or another global health crisis, impacts our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others’ ability to conduct business or negatively affects consumer and business confidence or the global economy. The COVID-19 health crisis has affected large segments of the global economy, including the markets we operate in. The COVID-19 pandemic began affecting our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in late March 2020, we had limited production at our facility in Batavia, New York, with only a small staff present, which significantly reduced our production capabilities for approximately three weeks.  As of June 2020, we are now nearing the pre-COVID-19 headcount of our production workforce and have applied numerous new health and safety protocols for those working onsite.The pandemic and any additional preventative or protective actions that governments or we may take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our business or our suppliers, distribution channels, and customers, including business shutdowns or disruptions for an indefinite period of time, reduced operations, restrictions on shipping, fabricating or installing products, reduced consumer demand or customers’ ability to make payments.  We have and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to increased challenges with our workforce (including as a result of illness, absenteeism or government orders), implementing further precautionary measures to protect the health of our workforce, increased project cancellations or projects put on hold, access to supplies, capital, and fundamental support services (such as shipping and transportation).  Any resulting financial impact cannot be fully estimated at this time, but may materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain the pandemic or treat its impact, among others.The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors
, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.  The situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are presently unaware of. The COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt and cause delays in our supply chains, and such disruptions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.The raw materials that we source come from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Global sourcing of many of the products we sell is an important factor in our financial results.  It is possible that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could cause a disruption in our supply chain.  If that supply chain is disrupted for an extended period of time, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic or another global health crisis, our ability to meet customer requirements and achieve our financial performance may be affected.  We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain, but we are maintaining ongoing communications with our suppliers to monitor their status.  Any disruption to our supply chain could negatively impact our operations and financial performance.Disruption to the global oil markets and resulting substantial price decline, including from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our customers’ and our own results of operations and financial performance.Our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition, or that of our customers, may be adversely affected by significant decreases in demand for oil resulting from global restrictions on travel, work from home practices, and the significant reduction in industrial and commercial activity, or an increase in operating costs as a result of the global business disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or that may result from a future global health crisis.  Global oil markets have recently experienced significant volatility and dramatic decreases in prices due to decreased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from government-led “stay-at-home” orders and social distancing initiatives and a geopolitical imbalance of supply.  Demand for some of our products is dependent on the level of expenditures by our customers in the oil and gas industry.  Accordingly, continued volatility or downturns in the oil markets, and potential project cancellations, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. 8The COVID-19 pandemic may impact businesses differently across various regions. We operate and compete globally. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic by domestic and foreign governments has been and may continue to be varied and those differences may impact our competitiveness.  Our operating subsidiaries are located in China and India, and those countries’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have varied from the United States’ response.  There are uncertain political climates in the regions where our subsidiaries operate, and governmental action in those regions may result in the temporary closure or limited operations of our subsidiaries.  Government assistance during a pandemic may also differ between private and public companies, which may provide an advantage to one compared with another.  This may affect our competitive position and could disrupt the market access and success of our business compared with other current or new competitors.  This impact could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation.COVID-19 disruption could impact our management team due to illness from the pandemic.Our business has specialized management, technical and sales personnel who may become unavailable for an extended period or lost due to the effect of COVID-19 or another pandemic.  The COVID-19 pandemic may significantly disrupt our workforce if a significant percentage of our employees are unable to work due to illness or quarantines.  In addition, COVID-19-related illness could impact members of our Board of Directors, resulting in absenteeism from meetings of the directors or committees of directors, making it more difficult to convene the quorums of the full Board of Directors or its committees needed to conduct meetings for the management of our affairs.  Any of the loss of personnel or disruption in management as described above could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.Risks related to our business: The markets we serve include the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. These industries are both highly cyclical in nature and dependent on the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as on the differential between the two prices.  As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results. A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, and petroleum refining industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries.  These industries are highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns.  The prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been very volatile, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in oil prices over the past few years and, in particular, the recent volatility related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers often refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes and future demand projections are clearer.  If our customers refrain from placing orders with us, our revenue would decline and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We believe that over the long-term, demand for our products will expand in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries.  A sustained deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.  As we have seen in the recent past, a cyclical downturn can occur suddenly and result in extremely different financial performance sequentially from quarter to quarter or on an annual comparative basis due to an inability to rapidly adjust costs.The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others.  A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities going forward and the profitability of those opportunities.  A demand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact the demand for our products.  If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources.  For example, non-fossil based sources may require and often receive government tax incentives to foster investment.  If these incentives become more prominent, our business and results of operations could suffer.A transition toward different types of energy may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Changes in consumer demand, including some driven by governmental and political preferences, toward electric, compressed natural gas, hydrogen vehicles and other alternative energy may impact our business.  We have products which can support certain technologies, while other technologies will not require our equipment.  A significant change in demand for oil based products may have a material adverse impact on our business.9Our business is highly competitive.  If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.We encounter intense competition in all of our markets.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources.  Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Certain competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us due to their geography or changes in relative currency values and may compete against us based on price.  This may affect our ability to secure new business and maintain our level of profitability.  In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers.  Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers.  If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected.A change in our end use customers, our markets, or a change in the engineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.Although we have long-term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different.  Our customers have historically focused on the quality of the engineering and product solutions which we have provided to them.  As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  Because our customers are unable to predict the length of the time period for the economic viability of their plants, there has been more of a focus on relative importance of cost versus quality which looks at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost of operations.A change in the structure of our markets; the relationships between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain and any of their relationships with the end users could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.There are strong and long-standing relationships throughout the supply chain between the many parties involved in serving the end user of our products.  A change in the landscape between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain, including disruptions in the supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and/or with the end users could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  These changes might occur through acquisitions or other business partnerships and could have a material impact on our business and negatively impact our financial results. The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations. While we may have only one customer represent over 10% of revenue in any one year, a small number of customers have accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales.  For example, sales to our top ten customers, who can vary each year, accounted for 48%, 41% and 41% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively.  We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future.  The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers, or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.We may experience customer concentration risk related to strategic growth for U.S. Navy projects.We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities may lead to U.S. Navy related projects consistently being greater than 10% of our total revenue.  While these projects are spread across multiple contractors for the U.S. Navy, the end customer for these projects is the same.  This concentration of business could add additional risk to us should there be a disruption, short or long term, in the funding for these projects or our participation in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion program.The size of our contracts with the U.S. Navy may produce volatility over the short term financial results.We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities, which are often much larger contracts than our commercial contracts, may impact our ability to effectively provide accurate investor guidance for our near term financial results.  These contracts can, on occasion, be delayed before or during the revenue recognition cycle.  If we are unable to reallocate the resources to other projects, we may see an increase in unpredictable (greater) volatility in our near term financial results. 10A large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.For fiscal 2020, 36% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S.  Moreover, through our subsidiaries, we maintain a sales office in China and a sales and market development office in India.  We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available.  Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of: •nationalization of private enterprises and assets; •political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East and/or portions of the former Soviet Union; •the global economic impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic •political relationships between the U.S. and certain countries and regions; •differences in foreign laws, including difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights; •the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy; •credit risks; •currency fluctuations; •tariff and tax increases; •export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;  •shipping products during times of crisis or war; •our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; or •other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations.The impact of potential changes in customs and trade policies and tariffs imposed by the U.S. and those imposed in response by other countries, including China, as well as rapidly changing trade relations, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.The U.S. government has made proposals that are intended to address trade imbalances, which include encouraging increased production in the United States.  These proposals could result in increased customs duties and the renegotiation of some U.S. trade agreements.  Changes in U.S. and foreign governments’ trade policies have resulted and may continue to result in tariffs on imports into, and exports from, the U.S.  Over the past few years, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from several countries, including China, Canada, the European Union and Mexico.  In response, China, Canada and the European Union have proposed or implemented their own tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. into those countries.  Tariffs affecting our products and product components, including raw materials we use, particularly high-end steel and steel related products, may add significant costs to us and make our products more expensive.  As a result, our products could become less attractive to customers outside the U.S. due to U.S. import tariffs on our raw materials and our profit margins would be negatively impacted.  Accordingly, continued tariffs may weaken relationships with certain trading partners and may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.  When beneficial to us, we may consider alternate sourcing options, including off shore subcontracting, in order to minimize the impact of the tariffs.  Because we conduct aspects of our business in China through our subsidiary, potential reductions in trade with China and diminished relationships between China and the U.S., including as a result of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the continued escalation of tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.11Global demand growth could be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins and increased competition.The increase in global demand could be led by emerging markets.  If this is the case, we may face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products.  Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain other industrialized countries where we compete.  If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Climate change and greenhouse gas regulations may affect our customers’ investment decisions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These restrictions may affect our customers' abilities and willingness to invest in new facilities or to re-invest in current operations.  These requirements could impact the cost of our customers’ products, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower-carbon sources.  Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by China’s evolving economic, political and social conditions. We conduct our business in China primarily through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary.  The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China's political, economic and social conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases and changes in the rates or methods of taxation.  In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users.  Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or the operation of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China and India, which could harm our business. Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter.  Similarly, proprietary information may not be afforded the same protection in India as it is in our other major markets with more comprehensive intellectual property laws.  Although we take precautions in the operations of our subsidiaries to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business.  We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.  There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China.  The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value.  Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform.  Moreover, the relative inexperience of China's judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas.  Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.  For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Regulation of foreign investment in India may adversely affect the operations of our Indian subsidiary.Our subsidiary in India is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in India.  India regulates ownership of Indian companies by foreign entities.  These regulations may apply to our funding of our Indian operating subsidiary.  For example, the government of India has set out criteria for foreign investments in India, including requirements with respect to downstream investments by Indian companies owned or controlled by foreign entities and the transfer of ownership or control of Indian companies in certain industries.  These requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate our Indian subsidiary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required approvals for future acquisitions, investments or operations in India, or that we will be able to obtain such approvals on satisfactory terms.12Changes in U.S. and foreign energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business.Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur, as they may be related to changes in political administration, public policy or other factors.  The elimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks or shifts in focus in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S.  In recent years, the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful.  The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding.  A disruption in funding could adversely impact our business.One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy-related opportunities.  Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders.  The time between the awarding of an order to the completion of shipment can take three to seven years.  Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment.  Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue our production activity on these orders.  For example, the recent emergency spending bills related to the COVID-19 pandemic could compound the uncertainty already present in government funded programs.  Since this business is expected to increase as a percentage of our overall business, such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.Changes in the competitive environment for U.S. Navy procurement could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Over the past few years, we have expanded our business and the opportunities where we bid related to U.S. Navy projects.  This has increased our market share and caused an adverse share position for some of our competitors for these products.  Competitor response to our market penetration is possible.  Our customers may also raise concerns about their supplier concentration issues and the risk exposure related to this concentration.  As the U.S. Navy is looking to expand its fleet, there is also a risk that their facilities, their supply chain or our supply chain for raw materials, may not be able to support this expansion.  This could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.  Contract liabilities for large U.S. Navy contracts may be beyond our normal insurance coverage and a claim could have an adverse impact on our financial results.We are diligent at managing ongoing risks related to projects and the requirements of our customers.  Our history at managing risk provides significant evidence that our exposure and risk are minimal.  In addition, we secure business insurance coverage to minimize the impact of a major failure or liability related to our customers.  Due to certain U.S. government procurement policies, we may take on the risk of a liability for large U.S. Navy projects in excess of our insurance coverage and at a level which is higher than our commercial projects.  A claim related to one of these projects could have an adverse impact on our financial results.New technology used by the ships for the U.S. Navy may delay projects and may impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Certain U.S. Navy vessels are implementing new technologies, unrelated to any of the equipment that we provide.  If there is a complication or delay to any ship caused by this new technology, it may delay the procurement and fabrication of future vessels, which could have a negative impact on our business.Lapses in U.S. government appropriations have, and any future lapses could disrupt U.S. export processing and related procedures and, as a result, may materially and adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and business.Recently, the U.S. experienced lapses in federal appropriations, which have had, in the past, a short-term effect on our business.  Any such future lapse (each, a ""Government Shutdown"") could negatively affect our ability to ship finished products to customers.  We rely on federal government personnel, who are not able to perform their duties during a Government Shutdown, to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of our products, process export licenses for us and perform other services for us that, when disrupted, may prevent us from timely shipping products outside the U.S.  If we are unable to timely 13ship our products outside the U.S., there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business.  Moreover, our inability to ship products, or the perception by customers that we might not be able to timely ship our products in the future, may cause such customers to look to foreign competitors to fulfill their demand.  If our customers look to foreign competitors to source equipment of the type we manufacture, there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business.Near-term income statement impact from competitive contracts could adversely affect our operating results.During weaker market periods, we may choose to be more aggressive in pricing certain competitive projects to protect or gain market share or to increase the utilization of our facilities.  In these situations, it is possible that an incrementally profitable order, while increasing contribution, may be unprofitable from an accounting perspective when including fixed manufacturing costs.  In these situations, we are required to recognize the financial loss at the time of order acceptance, or as soon as our cost estimates are updated, whichever occurs first.  It is possible we may accumulate losses either on a large project or more than one project such that, in a short time period, for example, a reporting quarter, these losses may have a meaningful impact on the earnings of the period.Our operating results could be adversely affected by customer contract cancellations and delays.The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2020 was $112,389.  Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders.  The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales.  Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.  This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil.  As evidence of this, we had orders totaling $24,361 cancelled during the downturn between fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, but had no cancellations in fiscal years 2018 and 2019.  In fiscal year 2020, we had two cancellations totaling $3,165 and two projects on hold, totaling $562.  We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may increase the risk of such cancellations.  Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations.  Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results.Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy.  In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in this end market which offers large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base.  A delay, long-term extension or cancellation of any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.An extended downturn could adversely impact the financial stability of our customers and increase the risk of uncollectable accounts receivables.Our customers participate in cyclical markets, such as petroleum refining, petrochemical and alternate energy.  The financial strength of our customers can be impacted by a severe or lengthy downturn in these markets, including any downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  This could lead to additional risk in our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables.  We attempt to mitigate this risk with the utilization of progress payments for many projects, but certain industries, end markets and geographies are not as willing to make progress payments.  Certain projects require a small portion of the total payments to be held until the customer's facility is fully operational, which can be in excess of one year beyond our delivery of equipment to them.  This additional time may add risk to our ability to collect on the outstanding accounts receivables.Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contracts could negatively impact our results of operations. A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments by us to our customers.  While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, estimating errors, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes.  To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability may decrease or losses may be incurred which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  For our U.S. Navy projects, these fixed priced contracts have order to shipment periods which can exceed five years.  This additional time-based risk, which we believe is manageable, nevertheless increases the likelihood of cost fluctuation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.14Given our size and specialization of our business, if we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense.  Moreover, our technology is highly specialized, and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel.  Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.  If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  During certain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities.  We could experience difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely affect our business.Our fabrication processes require highly skilled production workers, especially welders.  Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas.  While we have an in-house weld training program, if we are unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number of individuals with high-end welding capability, this could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives.  In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workers could dramatically increase in our and related industries and that could affect our financial performance.  Furthermore, should we not be able to expand our production workforce, we would expect to increase the amount of outsourced fabrication which is likely to result in higher costs and lower margins.  Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk.The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions.  In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management.  We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, issues or liabilities, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our management’s attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting.  Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisition’s existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business.  We also need to utilize key personnel who may be distracted from the core business.  If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition’s business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.If we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of our products, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us.  For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage.Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances.  Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and our historical experience may not reflect liabilities we may face in the future.  Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex or larger projects.  We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all.  Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us.  We may also incur significant warranty claims which are not covered by insurance.  In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer.  We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor 15and police our intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if we were found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer.  Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights.  Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars, and volatility in foreign currency exchange rates has generally increased in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies.  Strength of the U.S. dollar compared with the Euro or Asian currencies may put us in a less competitive position.  At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. dollar saw relative strengthening in relation to the Euro and Asian currencies, however, as the pandemic has continued, the relative strength of the U.S. dollar has increased in volatility.  Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified.  In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  At March 31, 2020, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business.  We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems.  Threats to these systems, and the laws and regulations governing security of data, including personal data, on information systems and otherwise held by companies is evolving and adding layers of complexity in the form of new requirements and increasing costs of attempting to protect information systems and data and complying with new cybersecurity regulations.  Information systems are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our information systems, computer technology, and business.  Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information systems and computer technology to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats.  The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures.  A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations.  Further, our technology resources may be strained due to the increase in the number of remote users in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.  We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.  In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us.  For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination.  Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.16Many of our large international customers are nationalized or state-owned businesses.  Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations.We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions.  Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products.  While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible.  If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders' ability to change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Such provisions include: •We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms averse to our common stock.  Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock.  We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. •Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year.  This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors. •Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting.  Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.   •Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote.  In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.  •Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.  Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.  This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.   •Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.  Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.  This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board"
8,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2019-05-31,"       Risk Factors
 Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations. Risks related to our business The markets we serve include the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. These industries are both highly cyclical in nature and dependent on the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as on the differential between the two prices.  As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results.A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries.  These industries are highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns.  The prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been very volatile, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in oil prices over the past few years.  During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers often refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes and future demand projections are clearer. If our customers refrain from placing orders with us, our revenue would decline and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We believe that over the long-term, demand for our products will expand in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries.  A sustained deterioration in any of the 7industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.  As we have seen in the recent past, a cyclical downturn can occur suddenly and result in extremely different financial performance sequentially from quarter to quarter or on an annual comparative basis due to an inability to rapidly adjust costs.The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others.  A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities going forward and the profitability of those opportunities.  A demand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact the demand for our products.  If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources.  For example, non-fossil based sources may require and often receive government tax incentives to foster investment.  If these incentives become more prominent, our business and results of operations could suffer.Our business is highly competitive.  If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.We encounter intense competition in all of our markets.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources.  Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Certain of our competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us due to their geography or changes in relative currency values and may compete against us based on price.  This may affect our ability to secure new business and maintain our level of profitability.  In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers.  Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers.  If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected. A change in our end use customers, our markets, or a change in the engineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.Although we have long-term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different.  Our customers have historically focused on the quality of the engineering and product solutions which we have provided to them.  As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  There has been more of a focus on relative importance of cost versus quality which looks at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost of operations.  Our customers are unable to predict the length of the time period for the economic viability of their plants.A change in the structure of our markets; the relationships between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain and any of their relationships with the end users could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.There are strong and long-standing relationships throughout the supply chain between the many parties involved in serving the end user of our products.  A change in the landscape between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain and/or with the end users could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  These changes might occur through acquisitions or other business partnerships and could have a material impact on our business and negatively impact our financial results. The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.  A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to our top ten customers, who can vary each year, accounted for 41%, 41% and 38% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for 8the foreseeable future. The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.We may experience customer concentration risk related to strategic growth for U.S. Navy projects. We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities will lead to U.S. Navy related projects consistently being greater than 10% of our total revenue.  While these projects are spread across multiple contractors for the U.S. Navy, the end customer for these projects is the same.  This concentration of business could add additional risk to us should there be a disruption, short or long term, in the funding for these projects or our participation in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion program.A large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.For fiscal 2019, 35% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S.  Moreover, through our subsidiaries, we maintain a sales office in China and a sales and market development office in India.  We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available.  Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:  •nationalization of private enterprises and assets; •political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East and/or portions of the former Soviet Union; •political relationships between the U.S. and certain countries and regions; •differences in foreign laws, including difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights; •the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy; •credit risks; •currency fluctuations; •tariff and tax increases; •export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;  •shipping products during times of crisis or wars; •our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; or •other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations. The impact of potential changes in customs and trade policies and tariffs imposed by the U.S. and those imposed in response by other countries, including China, as well as rapidly changing trade relations, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. The U.S. government has made proposals that are intended to address trade imbalances, which include encouraging increased production in the United States. These proposals could result in increased customs duties and the renegotiation of some U.S. trade agreements.  Changes in U.S. and foreign governments’ trade policies have resulted and may continue to result in tariffs on imports into, and exports from, the U.S.  Throughout 2018 and 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports from several countries, including China, Canada, the European Union and Mexico. In response, China, Canada and the European Union have proposed or implemented their own tariffs on certain exports from the U.S. into those countries. Tariffs affecting our products and product components, including raw materials we use, particularly high-end steel and steel related products, may add significant costs to us and make our 9products more expensive. As a result, our products could become less attractive to customers outside the U.S. due to U.S. import tariffs on our raw materials and our profit margins would be negatively impacted.  Accordingly, continued tariffs may weaken relationships with certain of our trading partners and may adversely affect our financial performance and results of operations.  When beneficial to us, we may consider alternate sourcing options, including off shore subcontracting, in order to minimize the impact of the tariffs.  Because we conduct aspects of our business in China through our subsidiary, potential reductions in trade with China and diminished relationships between China and the U.S., as well as the continued escalation of tariffs, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Global demand growth could be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins and increased competition. The increase in global demand could be led by emerging markets.  If this is the case, we may face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products. Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Climate change and greenhouse gas regulations may affect our customers’ investment decisions.  Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These restrictions may affect our customers' abilities and willingness to invest in new facilities or to re-invest in current operations.  These requirements could impact the cost of our customers’ products, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower-carbon sources.  Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by China’s evolving economic, political and social conditions.  We conduct our business in China primarily through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary.  The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China's political, economic and social conditions, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation.  In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users.  Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or the operation of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China and India, which could harm our business.  Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter.  Similarly, proprietary information may not be afforded the same protection in India as it is in our other major markets with more comprehensive intellectual property laws.  Although we take precautions in the operations of our subsidiaries to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business.  We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary. Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.  There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China.  The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value.  Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform.  Moreover, the relative inexperience of China's judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas.  Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.  For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   10Regulation of foreign investment in India may adversely affect the operations of our Indian subsidiary. Our subsidiary in India is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in India.  India regulates ownership of Indian companies by foreign entities.  These regulations may apply to our funding of our Indian operating subsidiary.  For example, the government of India has set out criteria for foreign investments in India, including requirements with respect to downstream investments by Indian companies owned or controlled by foreign entities and the transfer of ownership or control of Indian companies in certain industries.  These requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate our Indian subsidiary. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any required approvals for future acquisitions, investments or operations in India, or that we will be able to obtain such approvals on satisfactory terms.   Changes in U.S. and foreign energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business. Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur, as they may be related to changes in political administration, public policy or other factors. The elimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks or shifts in focus in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S.  In recent years, the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding.  A disruption in funding could adversely impact our business. One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy-related opportunities.  Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders.  The time between the awarding of an order to complete shipment can take three to seven years.  Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment.  Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue our production activity on these orders.  Since this business is expected to increase as a percentage of our overall business, such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.Changes in the competitive environment for U.S. Navy procurement could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Over the past few years, we have expanded our business and the opportunities where we bid related to U.S. Navy projects.  This has increased our market share and caused an adverse share position for some of our competitors for these products.  Competitor response to our market penetration is possible.  Our customers may also raise concerns about their supplier concentration issues and the risk exposure related to this concentration.  As the U.S. Navy is looking to expand its fleet, there is also a risk that their facilities, their supply chain or our supply chain for raw materials, may not be able to support this expansion.  This could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.  Contract liabilities for large U.S. Navy contracts may be beyond our normal insurance coverage and a claim could have an adverse impact on our financial results. We are diligent at managing ongoing risks related to projects and the requirements of our customers.  Our history at managing risk provides significant evidence that our exposure and risk is minimal.  In addition, we secure business insurance coverage to minimize the impact of a major failure or liability related to our customers.  Due to certain U.S. government procurement policies, we may take on the risk of a liability for large U.S. Navy projects in excess of our insurance coverage and at a level which is higher than our commercial projects.  A claim related to one of these projects could have an adverse impact on our financial results.  11New technology used by the ships for the U.S. Navy may delay projects and may impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Certain U.S. Navy vessels are implementing new technologies, unrelated to any of the equipment that we provide.  If there is a complication or delay to any ship caused by this new technology, it may delay the procurement and fabrication of future vessels, which could have a negative impact on our business. Any future lapse in U.S. government appropriations may disrupt U.S. export processing and related procedures and, as a result, may materially and adversely affect our revenue, results of operations and business. The impact of the lapse in U.S. federal appropriations which commenced on December 22, 2018 had a short-term effect on our business.  Any such future lapse (each, a ""Government Shutdown"") could negatively affect our ability to ship finished products to customers. We rely on federal government personnel, who are not able to perform their duties during a Government Shutdown, to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of our products, process export licenses for us and perform other services for us that, when disrupted, may prevent us from timely shipping products outside the U.S. If we are unable to timely ship our products outside the U.S., there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business. Moreover, our inability to ship products, or the perception by customers that we might not be able to timely ship our products in the future, may cause such customers to look to foreign competitors to fulfill their demand. If our customers look to foreign competitors to source equipment of the type we manufacture, there could be a material adverse impact on our results of operations and business. Near-term income statement impact from competitive contracts could adversely affect our operating results. During weaker market periods, we may choose to be more aggressive in pricing certain competitive projects to protect or gain market share or to increase the utilization of our facilities.  In these situations, it is possible that an incrementally profitable order, while increasing contribution, may be unprofitable from an accounting perspective when including fixed manufacturing costs.  In these situations, we are required to recognize the financial loss at the time of order acceptance, or as soon as our cost estimates are updated, whichever occurs first.  It is possible we may accumulate losses either on a large project or more than one project such that, in a short time period, for example, a reporting quarter, these losses may have a meaningful impact on the earnings of the period. Our operating results could be adversely affected by customer contract cancellations and delays. The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2019 was $132,127.  Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders.  The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2019 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.  This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil.  As evidence of this, we had orders totaling $24,361 cancelled during the downturn between fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, but have had no cancellations in fiscal years 2018 and 2019.  We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future. Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations. Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results. Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy.  In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in this end market which offers large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base.  A delay, long-term extension or cancellation of any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.An extended downturn could adversely impact the financial stability of our customers and increase the risk of uncollectable accounts receivables. Our customers participate in cyclical markets, such as petroleum refining, petrochemical and alternate energy.  The financial strength of our customers can be impacted by a severe or lengthy downturn in these markets.  This could lead to additional risk in our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables.  We attempt to mitigate this risk with the utilization of progress payments for many projects, but certain industries, end markets and geographies are not as willing to make progress payments.  Certain projects require a small portion of the total payments to be held until the customer's facility is fully operational, which can be in excess of one year beyond our delivery of equipment to them.  This additional time may add risk to our ability to collect on the outstanding accounts receivables. 12Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contracts could negatively impact our results of operations. A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments by us to our customers. While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, estimating errors, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes. To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability may decrease or losses may be incurred which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  For our U.S. Navy projects, these fixed priced contracts have order to shipment periods which can exceed five years.  This additional time-based risk, which we believe is manageable, nevertheless increases the likelihood of cost fluctuation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.Given our size and specialization of our business, if we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense.  Moreover, our technology is highly specialized, and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.  If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  During certain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities.  We could experience difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely affect our business.Our fabrication processes require highly skilled production workers, especially welders.  Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas.  While we have an in-house weld training program, if we are unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number of individuals with high-end welding capability, this could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives.  In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workers could dramatically increase in our and related industries and that could affect our financial performance.  Furthermore, should we not be able to expand our production workforce, we would expect to increase the amount of outsourced fabrication which is likely to result in higher costs and lower margins.   Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk. The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions.  In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management.  We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, issues or liabilities, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our management’s attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting.  Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisition’s existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business.  We also need to utilize key personnel who may be distracted from the core business.  If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition’s business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. If we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of our products, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us.  For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage.  13Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances.  Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and our historical experience may not reflect liabilities we may face in the future.  Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex or larger projects.  We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all.  Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur significant warranty claims which are not covered by insurance. In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer.  We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if we were found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer.  Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights.  Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars.  Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies.  Strength of the U.S. dollar compared with the Euro or Asian currencies may put us in a less competitive position.  Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified.  In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  At March 31, 2019, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business.  We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems.  Threats to these systems, and the laws and regulations governing security of data, including personal data, on information systems and otherwise held by companies is evolving and adding layers of complexity in the form of new requirements and increasing costs of attempting to protect information systems and data and complying with new cybersecurity regulations. Information systems are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our information systems, computer technology, and business.  Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information systems and computer technology to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of 14our operations.  In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.  In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us.  For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination. Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Many of our large international customers are nationalized or state-owned businesses.  Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions.  Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products.  While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders' ability to change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Such provisions include: •We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.  Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock.  We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. •Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year.  This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors. •Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting.  Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.   •Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote.  In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.   15 •Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.  Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.  This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.   •Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.  Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.  This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board"
7,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2018-06-04,"       Risk Factors
 Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations. Risks related to our business The markets we serve include the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. These industries are both highly cyclical in nature and dependent on the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as on the differential between the two prices.  As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results.A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries.  These industries are highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns.  We have been in such a downturn, which was sudden when it started and has begun to show signs of an initial recovery.  The prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been very volatile, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in oil prices over the past few years.  This volatility caused a steep decline in orders from the energy markets during the three-year period ending September 2017.  The increased supply and reduction in price of natural gas in North America has also caused a significant change in the global energy markets in the past few years.  During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers often refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes and future demand projections are clearer. If our customers refrain from placing orders with us, our revenue would decline and there could be a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.  Despite the near-term recent volatility, we believe that over the long-term, demand for our products will expand in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries, however, the current volatility in oil prices confirms that cyclical downturns will occur periodically.  A sustained deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.  As we have seen in the past few years, a cyclical downturn can occur suddenly and result in extremely different financial performance sequentially from quarter to quarter or on an annual comparative basis due to an inability to rapidly adjust costs.The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others.  A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities going forward and the profitability of those opportunities.  A demand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact the demand for our products.  If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources.  For example, non-fossil based sources may require and often receive government tax incentives to foster investment.  If these incentives become more prominent, our business and results of operations could suffer.Our business is highly competitive.  If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.We encounter intense competition in all of our markets.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources.  Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Certain of our competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us due to their geography or changes in relative currency values and may compete against us based on price.  This may affect our ability to secure new business and maintain our level of profitability.  In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers.  Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of 8lower cost suppliers.  If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected. A change in our end use customers, our markets, or a change in the engineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.Although we have long-term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different.  Our customers have historically focused on the quality of the engineering and product solutions which we have provided to them.  As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  In certain developing geographies, the relative importance of cost versus quality may lead to decisions which look at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost of operations.A change in the structure of our markets; the relationships between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain and any of their relationships with the end users could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.There are strong and long-standing relationships throughout the supply chain between the many parties involved in serving the end user of our products.  A change in the landscape between engineering and procurement companies, original equipment suppliers, others in the supply chain and/or with the end users could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.  These changes might occur through acquisitions or other business partnership and could have a material impact on our business and negatively impact our financial results. The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.  A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to our top ten customers, who can vary each year, accounted for 41%, 38% and 30% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.We may experience customer concentration risk related to strategic growth for U.S. Navy projects We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities will lead to U.S. Navy related projects consistently being greater than 10% of our total revenue.  While these projects are spread across multiple contractors for the U.S. Navy, the end customer for these projects is the same.  This concentration of business could add additional risk to Graham should there be a disruption, short or long term, in the funding for these projects or our participation in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion program.A large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.For fiscal 2018, 33% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S.  Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary and a sales office in China.  We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available.  Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:  •nationalization of private enterprises and assets; •political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East and/or portions of the former Soviet Union; •political relationships between the U.S. and certain countries and regions; •differences in foreign laws, including difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;9 •the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy; •credit risks; •currency fluctuations; •tariff and tax increases; •export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;  •shipping products during times of crisis or wars; •our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; or •other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations.The impact of potential changes in customs and trade policies in the United States and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business could adversely affect our financial performance.  The U.S. government has made proposals that are intended to address trade imbalances, which include encouraging increased production in the United States. These proposals could result in increased customs duties and the renegotiation of some U.S. trade agreements. We engage in sales outside of the United States. If custom duties are implemented or increased, it also may cause the trading partners of the United States to take actions with respect to U.S. imports in their respective countries. Any potential changes in trade policies in the United States and the potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business could adversely affect our financial performance.  The effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business have not yet been fully analyzed and could have an adverse affect on our results of operations.  On December 22, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act. The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The one-time transition tax is based on the total post-1986 earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiary that was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We continue to analyze the impact the Tax Act may have on our business including the impact of the total post-1986 foreign earnings and profits for our foreign subsidiary. Notwithstanding the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, guidance is still forthcoming, and no assurance can be made that future guidance will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results. Global demand growth could be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins and increased competition. The increase in global demand could be led by emerging markets.  If this is the case, we may face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products. Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Climate change and greenhouse gas regulations may affect our customers’ investment decisions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These restrictions may affect our customers’ abilities and willingness to invest in new facilities or to re-invest in current operations.  These requirements could impact the cost of our customers’ products, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower-carbon sources.  Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse affect on our business and results of operations. 10The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by China’s evolving economic, political and social conditions.  We conduct our business in China primarily through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary.  The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political, economic and social conditions, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation.  In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users.  Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm our business.  Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter.  Although we take precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business.  We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.   Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary. Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.  There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China.  The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value.  Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform.  Moreover, the relative inexperience of China’s judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas.  Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.  For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.   Changes in U.S. and foreign energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business. Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur, as they may be related to changes in political administration, public policy or other factors. The elimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse affect on our business.  Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results.Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks or shifts in focus in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S.  In recent years, the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding.  A disruption in funding could adversely impact our business. One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy-related opportunities.  Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders.  The time between the awarding of an order to complete shipment can take three to seven years.  Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment.  Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue our 11production activity on these orders.  Since this business is expected to increase as a percentage of our overall business, such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.Changes in the competitive environment for U.S. Navy procurement could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Over the past few years, we have expanded our business and the opportunities where we bid related to U.S. Navy projects.  This has increased our market share and caused an adverse share position for some of our competitors for these products.  Competitor response to our market penetration is possible.  Our customers may also raise concerns about their supplier concentration issues and the risk exposure related to this concentration.  As the U.S. Navy is looking to expand its fleet, there is also a risk that their facilities, their supply chain or our supply chain for raw materials, may not be able to support this expansion.  This could adversely impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.  Contract liabilities for large U.S. Navy contracts may be beyond our normal insurance coverage and a claim could have an adverse impact on our financial results. We are diligent at managing ongoing risks related to projects and the requirements of our customers.  Our history at managing risk provides significant evidence that our exposure and risk is minimal.  In addition, we secure business insurance coverage to minimize the impact of a major failure or liability related to our customers.  Due to certain U.S. government procurement policies, we may take on the risk of a liability for large U.S. Navy projects in excess of our insurance coverage and at a level which is higher than our commercial projects.  A claim related to one of these projects could have an adverse impact on our financial results.New technology used by the ships for the U.S. Navy may delay projects and may impact our ability to grow this portion of our business.Certain U.S. Navy vessels are implementing new technologies, unrelated to any of the equipment that we provide.  If there is a complication or delay to any ship caused by this new technology, it may delay the procurement and fabrication of future vessels, which could have a negative impact on our business.Political and regulatory developments could continue to make the utilization and growth of nuclear power as an energy source less desirable in the geographic markets we serve, which would harm our business and results of operations. A global event, such as a major earthquake or terrorist activity, may impact the desirability of operating existing nuclear power plants or building new or replacement nuclear plants facilities. Should public opinion or political pressure result in the continued closing of existing nuclear facilities or otherwise result in the continued erosion of the nuclear power industry, especially within the U.S., the business, results of operations and growth prospects in the nuclear market could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, performs operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S.  It is possible that the NRC could take actions or impose regulations that adversely affect the demand for our products and services, or otherwise delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear power generation facilities, even temporarily. If any such event were to occur, our business or operations could be materially adversely impacted. Near-term income statement impact from competitive contracts could adversely affect our operating results. During weaker market periods, we may choose to be more aggressive in pricing certain competitive projects to protect or gain market share or to increase the utilization of our facilities.  In these situations, it is possible that an incrementally profitable order, while increasing contribution, may be unprofitable from an accounting perspective when including fixed manufacturing costs.  In these situations, we are required to recognize the financial loss at the time of order acceptance, or as soon as our cost estimates are updated, whichever occurs first.  It is possible we may accumulate losses either on a large project or more than one project such that, in a short time period, for example, a reporting quarter, these losses may have a meaningful impact on the earnings of the period. Our operating results could be adversely affected by customer contract cancellations and delays. The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2018 was $117,946.  Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders.  The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2018 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.  This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil.  As evidence of this, we had orders totaling $24,361 cancelled during the downturn between fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2017, but have had no cancellations in fiscal 2018.  We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future. Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, 12cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations. Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results. Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy.  In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in these end markets which offer large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base.  A delay, long-term extension or cancellation of any of these projects could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.An extended downturn could adversely impact the financial stability of our customers and increase the risk of uncollectable accounts receivables. Our customers participate in cyclical markets, such as petroleum refining, petrochemical and nuclear energy.  The financial strength of our customers can be impacted by a severe or lengthy downturn in these markets.  This could lead to additional risk in our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables.  We attempt to mitigate this risk with the utilization of progress payments for many projects, but certain industries, end markets and geographies are not as willing to make progress payments.  Certain projects require a small portion of the total payments to be held until the customer’s facility is fully operational, which can be in excess of one year beyond our delivery of equipment to them.  This additional time may add risk to our ability to collect on the outstanding accounts receivables.Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contracts could negatively impact our results of operations. A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments by us to our customers. While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, estimating errors, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes. To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability may decrease or losses may be incurred which, in turn, could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.  For our U.S. Navy projects, these fixed priced contracts have order to shipment periods which can exceed five years.  This additional time-based risk, which we believe is manageable, nevertheless increases the likelihood of cost fluctuation, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operation.Given our size and specialization of our business, if we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense.  Moreover, our technology is highly specialized, and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.  If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.  During certain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities.  We could experience difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely affect our business.Our fabrication processes require highly skilled production workers, especially welders.  Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas.  While we have an in-house weld training program, if we are unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number of individuals with high-end welding capability, this could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives.  In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workers could dramatically increase in our and related industries and that could affect our financial performance. Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk. The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions.  In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management.  We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the 13business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, issues or liabilities, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our management’s attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting.  Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisition’s existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business.  We also need to utilize key personnel who may be distracted from the core business.  If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition’s business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse affect on our business or results of operations. Should a portion of our current intangible assets or intangible assets that we might acquire through future M&A activity be impaired, results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our balance sheet currently includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel which make up 4% of the assets of the company.  The value of our intangible assets may increase further, in the future, if we complete additional acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy. We are required to review our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise.  Factors that could indicate that our intangible assets are impaired could include, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, and slower than expected growth rates in our markets. If a portion of our intangible assets becomes impaired as a result of such a review, the impaired portion of such assets would have to be written-off during that period.  Such a write-off could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.   If we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of our products, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us.  For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage. Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances.  Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and our historical experience may not reflect liabilities we may face in the future.  Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex or larger projects.  We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all.  Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse affect on our business and financial condition.  Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur significant warranty claims, which are not covered by insurance. In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer.  We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if we were found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer.  Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights.  Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain 14products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars.  Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies.  Strength of the U.S. dollar compared with the Euro or Asian currencies may put us in a less competitive position.  Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified.  In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  At March 31, 2018, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business.  We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems.  Threats to these systems, and the laws and regulations governing security of data, including personal data, on information systems and otherwise held by companies is evolving and adding layers of complexity in the form of new requirements and increasing costs of attempting to protect information systems and data and complying with new cybersecurity regulations. Information systems are subject to numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our information systems, computer technology, and business.  Global cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information systems and computer technology to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. The techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations.  In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations. We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.  In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us.  For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination. Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operations.Many of our large international customers are nationalized or state-owned businesses.  Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions.  Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products.  While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 15Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders’ ability to change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Such provisions include: •We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.  Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock.  We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the affect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. •Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year.  This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors. •Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting.  Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.   •Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote.  In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.   •Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.  Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.  This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.   •Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.  Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.  This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board"
2,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2017-06-05,"Risk Factors
 Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations. Risks related to our businessThe industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in such industries may adversely affect our operating results.A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries and to the U.S. Navy, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries.  The core industries in which our products are used are highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns.  We are currently in such a downturn, which was sudden when it started and has not shown signs of near term recovery.  The dramatic decline in global oil prices which began in calendar year 2014 translated into an abrupt contraction in orders in the energy markets and is the most recent example of the cyclical nature of our markets.   We believe that over the long-term, demand for our products will expand in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries, however, the current decline and volatility in oil prices confirms that cyclical downturns will occur periodically.  A sustained deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.  A cyclical downturn can occur suddenly and result in extremely different financial performance sequentially from quarter to quarter or on an annual comparative basis due to an inability to rapidly adjust costs.The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others.  A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities going forward and the profitability of those opportunities.  A demand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact the demand for our products.  If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources.  For example, non-fossil based sources may require and often receive government tax incentives to foster investment.  If these incentives become more prominent, our business and results of operations could suffer.Our business is highly competitive.  If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.We encounter intense competition in all of our markets.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources.  Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Certain of our competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us due to their geography or changes in relative currency values and may compete against us based on price.  This may affect our ability to secure new business and maintain our level of profitability.  In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers.  Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers.  If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected. A change in our end use customers, our markets, or a change in the engineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.Although we have long-term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different.  Our customers have historically focused on the quality of the engineering and product solutions which we have 8provided to them.  As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  In certain developing geographies, the relative importance of cost versus quality may lead to decisions which look at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost of operations.The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.  A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to our top ten customers, who can vary each year, accounted for 38%, 30% and 38% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.We may experience customer concentration risk related to strategic growth for U.S. Navy projects.We believe our strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities will lead to U.S. Navy related projects consistently being greater than 10% of our total revenue.  While these projects are spread across multiple contractors for the U.S. Navy, the end customer for these projects is the same.  This concentration of business could add additional risk to Graham should there be a disruption, short or long term, in the funding for these projects or our participation in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion program.A large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. For fiscal 2017, 25% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S.  Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary and a sales office in China.  We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available.  Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:  •nationalization of private enterprises and assets; •political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East and/or portions of the former Soviet Union; •political relationships between the U.S. and certain countries and regions; •differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights; •the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy; •credit risks; •currency fluctuations; •tariff and tax increases; •export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;  •shipping products during times of crisis or wars; •our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; or •other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations. 9 Global demand growth could be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins and increased competition. The increase in global demand could be led by emerging markets.  If this is the case, we may face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products. Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Climate change and greenhouse gas regulations may affect our customers' investment decisions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These restrictions may affect our customers' abilities and willingness to invest in new facilities or to re-invest in current operations.  These requirements could impact the cost of our customers’ products, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower-carbon sources.  Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by China's evolving economic, political and social conditions.  We conduct our business in China primarily through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary.  The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to evolving economic, political and social developments in China.  In particular, the results of operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China's political, economic and social conditions, changes in the relationship between China and its western trade partners, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation.  In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users.  Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm our business.  Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter.  Although we take precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business.  We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary. Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.  There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China.  The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value.  Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform.  Moreover, the relative inexperience of China's judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas.  Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.  For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   Changes in U.S. and foreign energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business. Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur, as they may be related to changes in political administration, public policy or other factors. The elimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could 10create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks or shifts in focus in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S.  In recent years the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding.  A disruption in funding could adversely impact our business. One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities.  Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders.  The time between the awarding of an order to complete shipment can take three to seven years.  Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment.  Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue our production activity on these orders.  Since this business is expected to increase as a percentage of our overall business, such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.Changes in the competitive environment for U.S. Navy procurement could adversely impact our ability to grow this business.As we have expanded our addressable opportunities, this has caused a change in the supply chain for these products.  We would expect continued changes to occur as our customers continue to consider supplier concentration issues and the risk which this may lead to for them.  Competitor response to our market penetration is also a concern.  In addition, our ability to expand beyond the U.S. Navy to grow with certain NATO customers may further impact the market dynamics.New technology on other parts of the ships for the U.S. Navy may delay projects and may impact our ability to grow this business.Certain U.S. Navy vessels are implementing new technologies, unrelated to any of the equipment that we provide to the vessel.  If there is a complication or delay to any ship caused by this new technology, it may delay the procurement and fabrication of future vessels, which could impact our business. Political and regulatory developments could make the utilization and growth of nuclear power as an energy source less desirable, which would harm our business and results of operations. A global event, such as a major earthquake or terrorist activity, may impact the desirability of operating existing nuclear power plants or building new or replacement nuclear plants facilities. Should public opinion or political pressure result in the closing of existing nuclear facilities or otherwise result in the failure of the nuclear power industry to grow, especially within the U.S., the business, results of operations and growth prospects in the nuclear market could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, performs operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S.  It is possible that the NRC could take actions or impose regulations that adversely affect the demand for our products and services, or otherwise delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear power generation facilities, even temporarily. If any such event were to occur, our business or operations could be materially adversely impacted. Near term income statement impact from competitive contracts could adversely affect our operating results. During weaker market periods, we may choose to be more aggressive in pricing certain competitive projects to protect or gain market share or to increase the utilization of our facilities.  In these situations, it is possible that an incrementally profitable order may be unprofitable from an accounting perspective when including fixed manufacturing costs.  In these situations, we are required to recognize the financial loss at time of order acceptance, or as soon as our cost estimates are updated, whichever occurs first.  It is possible we may accumulate losses either on a large project or more than one project such that, in a short time period, for example, a reporting quarter, these losses may have a meaningful impact on the earnings of the period.  11 Our operating results could be adversely affected by customer contract cancellations and delays. The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2017 was $82,590.  Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders.  The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2017 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.  This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil.  As evidence of this, we had orders totaling $24,457 cancelled during the past nine quarters.  We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future. Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations. Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results. Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy project.  In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in these end markets which offer large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base.  A delay, long-term extension or cancellation of any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.An extended downturn could adversely impact the financial stability of our customers and increase the risk of uncollectable accounts receivable.Our customers participate in cyclical markets, such as petroleum refining, petrochemical and nuclear energy.  The financial strength of our customers can be impacted by a severe or lengthy downturn in these markets.  This could lead to additional risk on our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivables.  We mitigate this risk with the utilization of progress payments for many projects, but certain industries, end markets and geographies are not as willing to make progress payments.  Certain projects require a small portion of the total payments to be held until the customer's facility is fully operational, which can be in excess of one year beyond our delivery of equipment to them.  This additional time may add risk to our ability to collect on the outstanding accounts receivables. Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contracts could negatively impact our results of operations.  A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments by us to our customers. While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, estimating errors, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes. To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability may decrease or losses may be incurred which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Given our size and specialization of our business, if we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense.  Moreover, our technology is highly specialized and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.  If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  During certain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities.  We could experience difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely affect our business.Our fabrication processes require highly skilled production workers, especially welders.  Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas.  If we are unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number of individuals with high-end welding capability, this could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives.  In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workers could dramatically increase in our and related industries and that could affect our financial performance.  12 Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk. The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions.  In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management.  We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our management's attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting.  Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisition's existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business.  If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition's business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Should a portion of our intangible assets be impaired, results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel which make up 14% of the assets of the Company.  The value of our intangible assets may increase in the future if we complete additional acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy. We are required to review our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise.  Factors that could indicate that our intangible assets are impaired could include, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, and slower than expected growth rates in our markets. If a portion of our intangible assets becomes impaired as a result of such a review, the impaired portion of such assets would have to be written-off during that period.  Although such a write-off would be non-cash, it could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results.   The commercial terms we accept may contain risks related to certain provisions, including payment or shipping terms, delivery timing, product liability, warranty or other claims, that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The commercial terms we accept require us to deliver products which meet certain specifications.  We negotiate payment terms, shipping terms and delivery timing with our customers.  Our failure to meet any of these terms or the failure of our customers to meet their requirements, or our acceptance of terms which are more onerous than our standard terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of our products, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us.  For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage. Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances.  Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and our historical experience may not reflect liabilities we may face in the future.  Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex or larger projects.  We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all.  Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur significant warranty claims, which are not covered by insurance. In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer.  We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if we were found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of 13others, our competitive position could suffer.  Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights.  Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars.  Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies.  Strength of the U.S. dollar compared with the Euro or Asian currencies may put us in a less competitive position.  Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified.  In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  At March 31, 2017, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business.  We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems.  Information systems are subject to threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our business.  A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations.  In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.  In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us.  For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination. Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Many of our large international customers are nationalized or state-owned businesses.  Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions.  Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products.  While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be 14held responsible. If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders' ability to change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Such provisions include: •We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.  Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock.  We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. •Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year.  This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors. •Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting.  Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.   •Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote.  In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.   •Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.  Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.  This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.   •Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.  Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.  This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board"
6,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2016-06-01,"Risk Factors
 Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations. Risks related to our businessThe industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in such industries may adversely affect our operating results.A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries and to the U.S. Navy, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries.  The core industries in which our products are used are highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns.  The dramatic decline and the continued volatility in global oil prices has translated into an abrupt contraction in orders in the energy markets and is the most recent example of the cyclical nature of our markets.   We believe that over the long-term, demand for our products is expanding in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries, however, the current decline and volatility in oil prices confirms that cyclical downturns will occur periodically.  A sustained deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.  A cyclical downturn can occur suddenly and result in extremely different financial performance sequentially from quarter to quarter or on an annual comparative basis due to an inability to rapidly adjust costs.The markets we serve include the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. These industries are both highly cyclical in nature and dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas as well as on the differential between the two prices.  As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results.The prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been very volatile, as evidenced by the extreme volatility in oil prices over the past two years.  This volatility caused a steep decline in orders from the energy markets over that period.  The increased supply and reduction in price of natural gas in North America has also caused a significant change in the global energy markets in the past few years.  During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers often refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes. If our customers refrain from placing orders with us, our revenue would decline and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Despite the near-term current volatility, we believe the global consumption of crude oil and natural gas will increase over the course of the next 20 years and that such increased consumption will result in continual increases in global capacity. Many of our products are purchased in connection with oil refinery construction, revamps and upgrades to expand global capacity. The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others.  A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities going forward and the profitability of those opportunities.  A demand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact the demand for our products.  If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources.  For example, non-fossil based sources may require and often receive government tax incentives to foster investment.  If these incentives become more prominent, our business and results of operations could suffer.Our business is highly competitive.  If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.We encounter intense competition in all of our markets.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources.  Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products.  Certain of our competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us and may compete against us based on price.  This may affect our ability to secure new business and maintain our level of profitability.  In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers.  Moreover, customer buying patterns 8can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers.  If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected. A change in our end use customers, our markets, or a change in the engineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.Although we have long-term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different.  Our customers have historically focused on the quality of the engineering and product solutions which we have provided to them.  As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  In certain developing geographies, the relative importance of cost versus quality may lead to decisions which look at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost of operations.The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.  A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to our top ten customers , who can vary each year, accounted for 30%, 38% and 32% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.We may experience customer concentration risk related to strategic growth for U.S. Navy projectsOur strategy to increase the penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities could lead to U.S. Navy related projects becoming greater than 10% of our total revenue.  While these projects are spread across multiple contractors for the U.S. Navy, the end customer for these projects is the same.  This concentration of business could add additional risk to Graham should there be a disruption, short or long term, in the funding for these projects or our participation in the U.S. Navy Nuclear Propulsion program.A large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. For fiscal 2016, 37% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S.  Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary and a sales office in China.  We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future.  We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available.  Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:  ·nationalization of private enterprises and assets; ·political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East and/or portions of the former Soviet Union; ·political relationships between the U.S. and certain countries and regions; ·differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights; ·the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth strategy; ·credit risks; ·currency fluctuations; ·tariff and tax increases; ·export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments; 9 ·shipping products during times of crisis or wars; ·our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; or ·other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations.Global demand growth could be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins and increased competition. The increase in global demand could be led by emerging markets.  If this is the case, we may face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products. Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Climate change and greenhouse gas regulations may affect our customers’ investment decisions. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  These restrictions may affect our customers’ abilities and willingness to invest in new facilities or to re-invest in current operations.  These requirements could impact the cost of our customers’ products, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward lower-carbon sources.  Any of the foregoing could adversely impact the demand for our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by China’s evolving economic, political and social conditions.  We conduct our business in China primarily through our wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary.  The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to evolving economic, political and social developments in China.  In particular, the results of operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political, economic and social conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation.  In addition, changes in demand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users.  Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm our business.  Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter.  Although we take precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products that we undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business.  We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary. Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China.  There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China.  The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value.  Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform.  Moreover, the relative inexperience of China’s judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas.  Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.  For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain timely or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   Changes in U.S. and foreign energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business. 10Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur, as they may be related to changes in political administration, public policy or other factors. The elimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S.  In recent years the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding.  A disruption in funding could adversely impact our business. One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities.  Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders.  The time between the awarding of an order to complete shipment can take three to six years.  Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment.  Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue our production activity on these orders.  Since this business is expected to increase as a percentage of our overall business, such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.Changes in the competitive environment for U.S. Navy procurement could adversely impact our ability to grow this business.As we have expanded our addressable opportunities, this has caused a change in the supply chain for these products.  We would expect continued changes to occur as our customers continue to consider supplier concentration issues and the risk which this may lead to for them.  Competitor response to our market penetration is also a concern.  In addition, our ability to expand beyond the U.S. Navy to grow with certain NATO customers may further impact the market dynamics. Political and regulatory developments could make the utilization and growth of nuclear power as an energy source less desirable, which would harm our business and results of operations. A global event, such as a major earthquake or terrorist activity, may impact the desirability of operating existing nuclear power plants or building new or replacement nuclear plants facilities. Should public opinion or political pressure result in the closing of existing nuclear facilities or otherwise result in the failure of the nuclear power industry to grow, especially within the U.S., the business, results of operations and growth prospects in the nuclear market could be materially adversely impacted. In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, performs operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S.  It is possible that the NRC could take actions or impose regulations that adversely affect the demand for our products and services, or otherwise delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear power generation facilities, even temporarily. If any such event were to occur, our business or operations could be materially adversely impacted. Near term income statement impact from competitive contracts could adversely affect our operating results. During weaker market periods, we may choose to be more aggressive in pricing certain competitive projects to protect or gain market share or to increase the utilization of our facilities.  In these situations, it is possible that an incrementally profitable order may be unprofitable from an accounting perspective when including fixed manufacturing costs.  In these situations, we are required to recognize the financial loss at time of order acceptance, or as soon as our cost estimates are updated, whichever occurs first.  It is possible we may accumulate losses either on a large project or more than one project such that, in a short time period, for example, a reporting quarter, these losses may have a meaningful impact on the earnings of the period. Our operating results could be adversely affected by customer contract cancellations and delays. 11The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2016 was $107,963.  Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders.  The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2016 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.  This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil.  As evidence of this, we had three orders totaling $12,095 cancelled during fiscal 2016 and, including the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, $17,990 were cancelled during the past five quarters.  We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future. Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations. Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results. Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy project.  In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in these end markets which offer large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base.  A delay, long-term extension or cancellation of any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contracts could negatively impact our results of operations.  A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments by us to our customers. While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, estimating errors, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes. To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability may decrease or losses may be incurred which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Given our size and specialization of our business, if we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business could be harmed.Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense.  Moreover, our technology is highly specialized and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.  If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  During certain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities.  We could experience difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely affect our business.Our fabrication processes require highly skilled production workers, especially welders.  Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas.  If we are unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number of individuals with high-end welding capability, this could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives.  In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workers could dramatically increase in our and related industries and that could affect our financial performance. Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk. The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions.  In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management.  We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our management’s attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting.  Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisition’s existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business.  If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition’s business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.12  Should a portion of our intangible assets be impaired, results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel which make up 15% of the assets of the company.  The value of our intangible assets may increase in the future if we complete additional acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy. We are required to review our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise.  Factors that could indicate that our intangible assets are impaired could include, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, and slower than expected growth rates in our markets. If a portion of our intangible assets becomes impaired as a result of such a review, the impaired portion of such assets would have to be written-off during that period.  Such a write-off could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   If we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of our products, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us.  For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage. Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances.  Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and our historical experience may not reflect liabilities we may face in the future.  Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex or larger projects.  We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all.  Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur significant warranty claims, which are not covered by insurance. In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights.  If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer.  We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.  Similarly, if we were found to have infringed upon the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer.  Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights.  Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars.  Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies.  13Strength of the U.S. dollar compared with the Euro or Asian currencies may put us in a less competitive position.  Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified.  In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars.  While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.  In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation.  Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  At March 31, 2016, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turn could harm our business and financial results.We utilize information systems and computer technology throughout our business.  We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems.  Information systems are subject to threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to the stability and security of our business.  A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data, production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations.  In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operational efficiencies of our business.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.  In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us.  For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination. Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Many of our large international customers are nationalized or state-owned businesses.  Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions.  Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products.  While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders' ability to change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that some stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Such provisions include: ·We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.  Under our certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock.  We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.14 ·Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year.  This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors. ·Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting.  Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.   ·Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote.  In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.   ·Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.  Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.  This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.   ·Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.  Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.  This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board. "
10,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2015-06-02,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or whichwe currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results of operations.  Risks related to our business The industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in such industries may adverselyaffect our operating results.  A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of ourproducts to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries and to the U.S. Navy, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries. The core industries in which our products are usedare highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns. The dramatic decline in global oil prices in the second half of calendar year 2014 that translated into an abrupt contraction in orders in the energy markets is the most recentexample of the cyclical nature of our markets. We believe that for the long-term, we are in an expansion for demand for our products in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries, however, the recent decline in oil pricesconfirms that cyclical downturns will occur periodically. A sustained or renewed deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resourcesnecessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities. A cyclical downturn can occur suddenly and result in extremely different financial performance sequentially fromquarter to quarter or on an annual comparative basis due to an inability to rapidly adjust costs.  Thelarger markets we serve include the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries. These industries are both highly cyclical in nature and dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas as well as on the differential between the two prices.As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results.  The prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been very volatile, as evidenced by the approximately 50% decline in oil prices in the second half of calendar 2014. Importantly, this caused asteep decline in orders from the energy markets. The increased supply and reduction of cost of natural gas in North America has also caused a significant change in the global energy markets in the past few years. During times of significantvolatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers often refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes. If our customers refrain from placing orders with us, our revenue would decline and there could be a material adverseeffect on our business and results of operations. We believe that the global consumption of crude oil and natural gas will increase over the course of the next 20 years and that such increased consumption will result in a need to continuallyincrease global capacity. Many of our products are purchased in connection with oil refinery construction, revamps and upgrades to expand global capacity.  The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydropower and numerous forms of alternative energy production may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results. Global and regional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro,nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal and biomass, among others. A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities going forward. A demand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or afew sources of energy may also impact demand for our products. If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base or expertise, our business and  6 Table of Contentsfinancial results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, governmental policy can affect the relative importance of various forms of energy sources. Non-fossil based sources mayrequire government tax incentives to foster investment.  Our business is highly competitive. If we areunable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or against competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors. We encounter intense competition in all of our markets. Some of our present and potential competitorsmay have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devotegreater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products. Certain of our competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us and may compete against us based on price. This may affect our ability to secure new businessand maintain our level of profitability. In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address theneeds of our customers. Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers. If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will bematerially adversely affected.  A change in our end use customers, our markets, or a change in theengineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results.  Although we have long-term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement and construction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and coststo support each customer and customer type are often different. As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricing as a result of facing competitors with lower production costs, which may have amaterial adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results. In certain developing geographies, the relative importance of cost versus quality may lead to decisions which look at short-term costs instead of total long-term cost ofoperations.  The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers couldreduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.  A small number of customers hasaccounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to our top ten customers accounted for 38%, 32% and 41% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect that a limited number ofcustomers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers or a delay in the production ofexisting orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.  A largepercentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations. For fiscal 2015, 36% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S. Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary anda sales office in China. We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. We intend to continue to expand our internationaloperations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available. Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:      nationalization of private enterprises and assets;     political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East or portions of theformer Soviet Union;   7 Table of Contents   differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;     the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growthstrategy;      credit risks;      currency fluctuations;      tariff and tax increases;      export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;     shipping products during times of crisis or wars;      our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and     other factors inherent in maintaining foreign operations. Global demand growth could be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins and increasedcompetition.  The increase in global demand could be led by emerging markets. If this is the case, wemay face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products. Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S.and certain other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could be materiallyadversely affected.  The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by Chinasevolving economic, political and social conditions.  We conduct our business in China primarily througha wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to evolving economic, political and social developments in China. In particular, the results of operations of our Chinesesubsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political, economic and social conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of existing lawsand regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation. In addition, changes in demand could result fromincreased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned marketparticipants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business. Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm our business. Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets andlimited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Although we take precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products thatwe undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We may also have limited legal recourse in the event weencounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary. Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. There areuncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China. The Chinese   8 Table of Contentslegal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value. Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is stillevolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative inexperience of Chinas judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and theinterpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas. Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic. For the precedingreasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain swift or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business. Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate thatenergy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur. The elimination of, or a change in,any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Government subsidies ortaxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  Regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and/or increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing ourproducts.  SEC rules require disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that arenecessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by companies filing public reports. This rule, which became effective for the 2013 calendar year, requires companies to perform due diligence,disclose, and report whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. This rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in themanufacture of our products. Moreover, the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may become limited. In addition, there may be significant costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements. We also may not be able tosufficiently verify the origins of the relevant conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we have implemented, which could harm our reputation. Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks in defense spending or inreduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in thealternative energy markets in the U.S. In recent years the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced oreliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, aswell as our growth opportunities.  U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding. Adisruption in expected funding could adversely impact our business.  One of our growth strategies is toincrease our penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities. Projects for the U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order-to-shipment time period than our commercial orders. The time between receipt of an order to completeshipment can take three to five years, or possibly longer. Annual government funding is required to continue the production of this equipment. Disruption of government funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue ourproduction activity on these orders. Such a disruption, should it occur, could adversely impact the sales and profitability of our business.   9 Table of ContentsChanges in tax policies and tax rates in the U.S. could result inadverse impacts for domestic manufacturing investments, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Our business is dependent on significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. The impact of changes to U.S. tax policyaround capital investment and related depreciation could reduce our customers willingness to invest in domestic capacity. The impact of such reductions could have a materially adverse affect on our business and operations. We serve markets that are capital intensive. Volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets andadverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our operating results. Such volatility and disruption may also negatively impact our ability to access additional financing if and when needed. If adverse economic and credit conditions occur, we would likely experience decreased revenue from our operationsattributable to decreases in the spending levels of our customers. Moreover, adverse economic and credit conditions might also have a negative adverse effect on our cash flows if customers demand that we accept smaller project deposits and lessfrequent progress payments. In addition, adverse economic and credit conditions could lead to increased downward pricing pressure. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtainadditional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, should we determine such financing is necessary or desirable to maintain or expand our business or effectively pursue our business strategy. Political and regulatory developments could make the utilization and growth of nuclear power as an energy sourceless desirable, which would harm the business and results of operations of our subsidiary Energy Steel. A global event, such as a major earthquake or terrorist activity, may impact the desirability of operating nuclear powerplants. These events can create uncertainties worldwide regarding, among other things, the desirability of operating existing nuclear power plants and the building of new or replacement nuclear power plants. Should public opinion or politicalpressure result in the closing of existing nuclear facilities or otherwise result in the failure of the nuclear power industry to grow, especially within the U.S., the business, results of operations and growth prospects of our subsidiary EnergySteel in the nuclear market could be materially adversely impacted.  In addition, the U.S. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, or NRC, performs operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S. It is possible that the NRC could take actions or impose regulations that adversely affect the demand for Energy Steels products and services, orotherwise delay or prohibit construction of new nuclear power generation facilities, even temporarily. If any such event were to occur, the business or operations of Energy Steel could be materially adversely impacted. A change in supply or cost of the materials used in our products could harm our profit margins. Our profitability depends in part on the price and continuity of supply of the materials used in the manufacture of ourproducts which, in many instances, are supplied by a limited number of sources. The availability and costs of these commodities may be influenced by, among other things, market forces of supply and demand, changes in world politics, labor relationsbetween the producers and their work forces, export quotas, and inflation. Any restrictions on the supply of the materials used by us in manufacturing our products could significantly reduce our profit margins, which could harm our results ofoperations. Likewise, any efforts we may engage in to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by entering into long-term purchase agreements, by implementing productivity improvements or by passing cost increases on toour customers may not be successful. In addition, the ability of our suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can also impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. Future shortages or lower cost of raw materials could result indecreased sales as well as margins, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business.  We aresubject to contract cancellations and delays by our customers, which may adversely affect our operating results.  The value of our backlog as of March 31, 2015 was $113,811. Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders. The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2015 is notnecessarily indicative of future   10 Table of Contentsbacklog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared withour total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders. This generally occurs more often in times of end market or capital market turmoil. As evidence of this, we had two orders totaling $5,895 cancelled in thefourth quarter of fiscal 2015. We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future. Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers tocompensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results ofoperations. Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results.  Our current backlog contains a number of large orders from the U.S. Navy project. In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in these end markets which offer large multi-year projects which have anadded risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base. A delay, long term extension or cancellation in any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our accounts receivables and unbilled revenue may be at potential risk if a project is terminated or canceled or ifour customers encounter financial difficulties.  Our contracts often require us to satisfy or achievecertain milestones in order to receive payment for the work performed. In general, payments to us are such that we are ahead of our costs, however, if the customer does not proceed with the completion of the project or if the customer defaults onits payment obligations, we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us. If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us, this would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. If we are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production during times when we areexperiencing strong demand, our results of operations might be adversely affected. In addition, outsourcing may negatively affect our profit margins.  We from time to time increase our manufacturing capacity through outsourcing selected fabrication processes. We could experience difficulty in outsourcing if customers demand that our products bemanufactured by us exclusively. Furthermore, our ability to effectively outsource production could be adversely affected by worldwide manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to effectively outsource our production capacity when circumstanceswarrant, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected and we might not be able to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. In addition, any disputes between us and the entities that we outsource to may delay ourability to fulfill our obligations to our customers, which may harm our reputation and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, outsourcing to complete our products and services can increasethe costs associated with such products and services. If we rely too heavily on outsourcing and are not able to increase our own production capacity during times when there is high demand for our products and services, our profit margins may benegatively impacted.  Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of such contractscould negatively impact our results of operations.  A substantial portion of our sales is derived fromfixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments by us to our customers. While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, includingbut not limited to, cost overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes. To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, theoriginal cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability from a particular contract may decrease or losses may be incurred, which, inturn, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   11 Table of ContentsWe utilize percentage of completion accounting on the majority of oursales. Changes in estimates for production could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported sales and earnings.  For the majority of our sales, cost of goods sold and operating profit are recognized using percentage of completion method of accounting. This accounting method requires updated recognition of sales andcost for each project on a quarterly basis. If the portion of a project is under or over-estimated, a correction is required to be made in the current period. Corrections for large projects could significantly impact short term financial results.Large revisions could reverse sales, costs and earnings reported in prior periods.  If we lose anymember of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, our business would be harmed.  Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense. Moreover, our technology is highly specialized and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any ofour key technical and sales personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be consideredby some to be more desirable places to live. If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. A dramatic short-term change in our end markets and our reaction to it may impact our ability to execute ourstrategic plan over the long term.  Execution of our strategic plan requires us to invest in ourequipment, people and other resources with a view toward the long term. Achieving our long-term objectives may require us to pre-invest and add costs to our business before the matching revenue occurs. This is necessary to ensure that thedevelopment of our employees is such that we may effectively serve our customers. When there is a dramatic and unforeseen change in market conditions, which affects our customers and therefore our business, we may have to choose between continuingto pre-invest, which will impact near-term profitability or to eliminate costs which may impede our long-term ability to execute our strategic plan.  During certain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities. We could experience difficulty hiring or replacingthose individuals, which could adversely affect our business.  Our fabrication processes require highlyskilled production workers, especially welders. Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas. If we were to be unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number ofindividuals with high-end welding capability, this could impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives. In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workerscould dramatically increase in our and related industries and that could affect our financial performance. If we are unable to make necessary capital investments or respond to pricing pressures, our business may be harmed. In order to remain competitive, we need to invest continuously in manufacturing, customer service andsupport, research and development and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not have available sufficient financial or other resources to continue to make the investmentnecessary to lower our production costs and help us maintain our competitive position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk. The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businessesto purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historicalbusiness, operations and management. We cannot provide any assurances that we   12 Table of Contentswill be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs,difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our managements attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internalcontrol over financial reporting. Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisitions existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business. If we are not able to efficiently integrate anacquisitions business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect,either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.  Should aportion of our intangible assets be impaired, results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel. The value of theseintangible assets may increase in the future if we complete additional acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy. We are required to review our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicatorsof permanent impairment arise. Factors that could indicate that our intangible assets are impaired could include, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, andslower than expected growth rates in our markets. If a portion of our intangible assets becomes impaired as a result of such a review, the impaired portion of such assets would have to be written-off during that period. Such a write-off could have amaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If we become subject to productliability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of ourproducts, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us. For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation orfailure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage.  Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractuallimitations of liability in certain circumstances. Our insurance may not cover all liabilities nor may our historical experience reflect any liabilities we may face in the future. Our risk of liability may increase as we manufacture more complex orlarger projects. We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all. Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverseeffect on our business and financial condition.  Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of anevent related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur significant warranty claims, which are not covered by insurance. In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as aresult of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to keep abreast of technological changes in ourmarkets, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  Although technologies inthe vacuum and heat transfer areas are well established, we believe our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new products in order to continue to meet customer demands. Our failure to introducenew or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis, or the development of processes that make our existing technologies or products obsolete could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   13 Table of ContentsIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we wereto infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury. Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, tradesecret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer. We may also be required to spend significantresources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Similarly, if we were found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may developtechnologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.  In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights andprotect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result insubstantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise ofour intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any ofwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject toforeign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.  We are exposed to therisk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars. Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremostbeing our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies. Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified. Inaddition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot removeall fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreigncurrencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. At March 31, 2015, we held no forward foreign currency exchangecontracts.  Changes in our effective tax rate and tax policies may impact our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and China. A change in tax laws or interpretationof tax laws, introduction of new tax accounting standards and regulation, our global mix of earnings, the ability to utilize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain tax positions could affect our effective tax rate and impact the financialperformance of the company. Changes in tax laws of other jurisdictions could impact the profitability of our competitors, which could affect our competitive position relative to those competitors. Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turncould harm our business and financial results.  We utilize information systems and computer technologythroughout our business. We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems. Information systems are subject to threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to thestability and security of our business. A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data,production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations. In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow  14 Table of Contentsoperational efficiencies of our business. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims that could result in substantial costs to usas well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict withcertainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future. In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, anyfailure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us. For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination. Any litigation brought againstus, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitiveposition and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations.  We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for thepurpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time incertain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products. While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and have established procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct fromoccurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are alleged or are found to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costsand suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risks related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders abilityto change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger,takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. Such provisions include:     We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.    Under our certificate ofincorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock. We could issueshares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.     Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.    Our bylaws provide for a classified Board ofDirectors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors.     Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.    Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bringbusiness before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for elec-  15 Table of Contents  tion as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting. Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of making itmore difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.      Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of controltransaction.    Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party tosuch transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote. In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.     Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.    Our certificate of incorporation containsprovisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposedamendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board. This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be intheir best interests without approval of our Board.      Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.    Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend ourbylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.  "
16,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2014-06-04,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below or elsewhere in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results ofoperations.  Risks related to our business The industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in such industries may adversely affect our operatingresults.  A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our products to companies inthe chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries and to the U.S. Department of Defense, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries. The core industries in which our products are used are, tovarying degrees, highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns. Although we believe that we are in a long-term expansion of demand for our products in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries, thereare cyclical downturns which occur periodically. A sustained or renewed deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary topurchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities.  The larger markets we serve are the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries which are both cyclical in nature and dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas and the relationshipbetween the two prices. As a result, volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results.  Although we believe that the global consumption of crude oil and natural gas will increase over the course of the next 20 years and that such increased consumption will result in a need to continuallyincrease global capacity, the prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been very volatile. Many of our products are   6 Table of Contentspurchased in connection with oil refinery construction, revamps and upgrades. The increased supply and reduction of cost of natural gas in North America has also caused a significant change inthe global energy markets in the past few years. During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers may refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes. If our customers refrain from placingorders, our revenue would decline and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  The change in the relationship between various energy sources may affect our business. The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydro power and numerous forms of alternative energyproduction may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.  Global andregional energy supply comes from many sources, including oil, natural gas, coal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, among others. A cost or supply shift among these sources could negatively impact our business opportunities goingforward. A demand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may also impact demand for our products. If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customerbase or expertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  Ourbusiness is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to currentand future competitors.  We encounter competition in all of our markets. Some of our present andpotential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they maybe able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products than we are able to. Certain of our competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us, and be able to respond to customer needs at lowerpricing levels. This may affect our ability to secure business and maintain our level of profitability. In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves orwith third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers. Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers. If we cannot compete successfullyagainst current or future competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected.  A change inour end use customers, our markets, or a change in the engineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results. Although we have long term relationships with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement andconstruction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type are often different. As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift inpricing and a shift of costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations. A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to ourtop ten customers accounted for 32%, 41% and 43% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeablefuture. The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.  7 Table of ContentsA large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result,we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.  Forfiscal 2014, 38% of our revenue was from customers located outside of the U.S. Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary and a sales office in China. We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for asignificant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available. Our foreign operations and sales could be adverselyaffected as a result of:      nationalization of private enterprises and assets;     political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East or portions of theformer Soviet Union;      differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;     the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growthstrategy;      credit risks;      currency fluctuations;      tariff and tax increases;      export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;     shipping products during times of crisis or wars;      our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and     other factors inherent in foreign operations. Global demand growth could be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins and increasedcompetition.  The increase in global demand could be led by emerging markets. If this is the case, wemay face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products. Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S.and certain of the other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operations could bematerially adversely affected.  The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected byChinas evolving economic, political and social conditions.   We conduct ourbusiness in China primarily through a wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to evolving economic, political and social developments in China. In particular, the resultsof operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political, economic and social conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in theinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation. In addition, changes indemand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable tonon-Chinese owned market participants, such as us, are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.   8 Table of ContentsIntellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, whichcould harm our business.  Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commerciallaw in many of our other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Although we take precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual property, anylocal design or manufacture of products that we undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We may alsohave limited legal recourse in the event we encounter patent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinesesubsidiary.  Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investmentin China. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value. Because many lawsand regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative inexperience of Chinas judiciary in many cases createsadditional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas. Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based onexisting law may be uncertain and sporadic. For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain swift or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness and results of operations.  Changes in energy policy regulations could adversely affect ourbusiness.  Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolvingrapidly and we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur. Theelimination of, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which would have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness. Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limitthe supply and/or increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.  SEC rulesrequire disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by companies filing public reports. The new rule, which becameeffective for the 2013 calendar year requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose, and report whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitiveprices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products. Moreover, the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may become limited. In addition, there may be significant costsassociated with complying with the disclosure requirements. We also may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we have implemented, which couldharm our reputation.  Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in governmentcutbacks in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations. Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in thealternative energy markets in the U.S. In recent years the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy  9 Table of Contentsrelated incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of suchreductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.  U.S. Navy orders are subject to annual government funding. A disruption in expected funding could impact the operation of our business. One of our growth strategies is to increase our penetration of U.S. Navy related opportunities. The projects bid on forthe U.S. Navy and its contractors generally have a much longer order to shipment time period than our commercial orders. An order to complete shipment in three to five years, or possibly longer, is common with equipment orders for the U.S. Navy.Annual government funding within the federal government to the U.S. Navy and then to its contractors is required to continue the production of this equipment. Disruption of funding, short or long term, could impact the ability for us to continue ourproduction activity on these orders and this disruption could impact the sales and profitability of our business.  Changes in tax policies and tax rates in the U.S. could result in adverse impacts for domestic manufacturing investments, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Our business is dependent on significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and the impact of changes to U.S. tax policyaround capital investment and related depreciation could reduce our customers willingness to invest in domestic capacity. The impact of such reductions could have a materially adverse affect on our business and operations. We serve markets that are capital intensive. Volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets andadverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our operating results. Such volatility and disruption may also negatively impact our ability to access additional financing if and when needed. In 2008, the state of the capital and credit markets caused a slow-down in spending by our customers and many of themcontinue to evaluate their project plans. If adverse economic and credit conditions return, we would likely experience decreased revenue from our operations attributable to decreases in the spending levels of our customers. Moreover, adverseeconomic and credit conditions might also have a negative adverse effect on our cash flows if customers demand that we accept smaller project deposits and less frequent progress payments. In addition, adverse economic and credit conditions couldlead to downward pricing pressure. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, should wedetermine such financing is desirable to maintain or expand our business or effectively pursue our business strategy.  Political and regulatory developments could make the utilization and growth of nuclear power as an energy source less desirable, which would harm the business and results of operations of oursubsidiary Energy Steel.  On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake and tsunami struck Japan andcaused substantial damage to the nuclear generating units at the Fukushima Daiichi generating plant. The events in Japan have created uncertainties worldwide regarding, among other things, the desirability of operating existing nuclear power plantsand building new or replacement nuclear power plants. Should public opinion or political pressure result in the closing of existing nuclear facilities or otherwise result in the failure of the nuclear power industry to grow, especially within theU.S., the business, results of operations and growth prospects of our subsidiary Energy Steel in the nuclear market could be materially adversely impacted.  In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, continues to perform additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S. It is possible that the NRC could take actionsor impose regulations that adversely affect the demand for Energy Steels products and services, or otherwise delays or prohibits construction of new nuclear power generation facilities, even temporarily. If any such event were to occur, thebusiness or operations of Energy Steel could be materially adversely impacted.   10 Table of ContentsA change in supply or cost of the materials used in our products couldharm our profit margins.  Our profitability depends in part on the price and continuity of supply ofthe materials used in the manufacture of our products, which in many instances are supplied by a limited number of sources. The availability and costs of these commodities may be influenced by, among other things, market forces of supply and demand,changes in world politics, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, export quotas, and inflation. Any restrictions on the supply of the materials used by us in manufacturing our products could significantly reduce our profitmargins, which could harm our results of operations. Likewise, any efforts we may engage in to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by entering into long-term purchase agreements, by implementing productivityimprovements or by passing cost increases on to our customers may not be successful. In addition, the ability of our suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can also impact our ability to meet commitments to customers. Future shortagesor lower cost of raw materials could result in decreased sales as well as margins, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business.  If we are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production during times when we are experiencing strong demand, our results of operations might be adversely affected. In addition,outsourcing may negatively affect our profit margins.  Part of our business strategy calls for us toincrease manufacturing capacity through outsourcing selected fabrication processes. We could experience difficulty in outsourcing if customers demand that our products be manufactured by us exclusively. Furthermore, our ability to effectivelyoutsource production could be adversely affected by worldwide manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to effectively outsource our production capacity when circumstances warrant, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected andwe might not be able to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. In addition, any disputes between us and the entities that we outsource to may delay our ability to fulfill our obligations to our customers, which may harm our reputationand in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, outsourcing to complete our products and services can increase the costs associated with such products and services. If we rely too heavily onoutsourcing and are not able to increase our own production capacity during times when there is high demand for our products and services, our profit margins may be negatively impacted. Our exposure to fixed-price contracts and the timely completion of these could negatively impact our results ofoperations.  A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which mayinvolve long-term fixed price commitments to customers. While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, cost overruns, supplierfailures and customer disputes. To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or othercontracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability from a particular contract may decrease or losses may be incurred, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effecton our business and results of operations.  We are subject to contract cancellations and delays by ourcustomers, which may adversely affect our operating results.  The value of our backlog as ofMarch 31, 2014 was $112,108. Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders. The amount of our backlog at March 31, 2014 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog willbe recognized as sales. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders. We cannotpredict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future. Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred oncancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations. Moreover, delay of contractexecution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results.   11 Table of ContentsOur current backlog contains large orders from the U.S. Navy project and forinstallation in new U.S. nuclear reactors. In addition, we are continuing to pursue business in these end markets which offer large multi-year projects which have an added risk profile beyond that of our historic customer base. A delay, long termextension or cancellation in any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We utilize percentage of completion accounting on the majority of our sales. Changes in estimates for production could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported sales and earnings. For the majority of our sales, cost of goods sold and operating profit are recognized using percentageof completion method of accounting. This accounting method requires updated recognition of sales and cost for each project on a quarterly basis. If the portion of a project is under or over-estimated, a correction is required to be made in thecurrent period. Corrections for large projects could significantly impact short term financial results. Large revisions could reverse sales, costs and earnings reported in prior periods. If we lose any member of our management team and we experience difficulty in finding a qualified replacement, ourbusiness would be harmed.  Competition for qualified management and key technical and sales personnelin our industry is intense. Moreover, our technology is highly specialized and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical and sales personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical andsales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live. If we are not able to retain any of our key management, technical or salespersonnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Duringcertain high demand periods, there can be a shortage of skilled production workers, especially those with high-end welding capabilities. We could experience a difficulty hiring or replacing those individuals, which could adversely affect ourbusiness.  Our fabrication processes require highly skilled production workers, especially welders.Welding has not been an educational field that has been popular over the past few decades as manufacturing has moved overseas. If we were to be unable to retain, hire or train an adequate number of individuals with high-end welding capability, thiscould impact our ability to achieve our financial objectives. In addition, if demand for highly skilled production workers were to significantly outstrip supply, wages for these skilled workers could dramatically increase in our and relatedindustries and that could affect our financial performance.  Our acquisition strategy may not besuccessful or may increase business risk.  The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, inpart, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize theanticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business andoperations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our managements attention,failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisitions existing business culture andcompensation structure with our existing business. If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisitions business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of theacquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.   12 Table of ContentsOur intangible assets substantially increased as a result of ouracquisition of Energy Steel. Should a portion of these intangible assets be impaired, results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel. The value of theseintangible assets may increase in the future if we complete additional acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy. We are required to review our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicatorsof permanent impairment arise. Factors that could indicate that our intangible assets are impaired could include, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, andslower than expected growth rates in our markets. If a portion of our intangible assets becomes impaired as a result of such a review, the impaired portion of such assets would have to be written-off during that period. Such a write-off could have amaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If we are unable to make necessarycapital investments or respond to pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.  In order to remaincompetitive, we need to invest continuously in manufacturing, customer service and support, research and development and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not have availablesufficient financial or other resources to continue to make the investment necessary to lower our production costs and help us maintain our competitive position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to keep abreast of technologicalchanges in our markets, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  Althoughtechnologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are well established, we believe our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new products in order to continue to meet customer demands. Ourfailure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis, or the development of processes that make our existing technologies or products obsolete could have a material adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon theintellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.  Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect ourproprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer. We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Similarly,if we were found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverseengineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietaryinformation, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us anddivert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual propertyand proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations.   13 Table of ContentsIf we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims,our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The manufacture andsale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems notmanufactured or sold by us. For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances,personal injury or property damage.  Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limitour damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances. Our insurance may not cover all liabilities nor may our historicalexperience reflect any liabilities we may face in the future. We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all. Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts orby insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Furthermore, if acustomer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur significant warranty claims, which are not covered by insurance. In the event acustomer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results. We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of thecountries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars. Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that basetheir prices on relatively weaker currencies. Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified. In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by usin a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changesin currency exchange rates. In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle theobligation. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. At March 31, 2014, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in our effective tax rate and tax policies may impact our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and China. A change in tax laws or interpretation of tax laws,introduction of new tax accounting standards and regulation, our global mix of earnings, the ability to utilize deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain positions could affect our effective tax rate and impact the financial performance of thecompany. Changes in tax laws of other jurisdictions could impact the profitability of our competitors, which could affect our competitive position relative to those competitors. Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turncould harm our business and financial results.  We utilize information systems and computer technologythroughout our business. We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems. Information systems are subject to threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to thestability and security of our business. A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data,production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations. In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operationalefficiencies of our business. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   14 Table of ContentsWe face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claimsthat could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert attention of our management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing productsand seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future. In addition, because some ofour products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us. For example, a claim could be made under various regulations for theadverse consequences of environmental contamination. Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which could have a material adverseeffect on our business and results of operations.  Any failure to comply with the United States ForeignCorrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engagingin bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery,pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products. While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and haveestablished procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are alleged or arefound to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders abilityto change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger,takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. Such provisions include:     We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.    Under our certificate ofincorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock. We could issueshares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.     Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.    Our bylaws provide for a classified Board ofDirectors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors.     Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.    Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bringbusiness before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting. Such advance noticeprovisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.   15 Table of Contents   Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of controltransaction.    Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party tosuch transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote. In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.     Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.    Our certificate of incorporation containsprovisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposedamendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board. This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be intheir best interests without approval of our Board.      Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.    Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend ourbylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.  "
1,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2013-06-05,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below or elsewhere in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results ofoperations.  Risks related to our business The industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in such industries may adversely affect our operatingresults.  Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from the sale of ourproducts to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries and to the U.S. Department of Defense, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries. The core industries in which ourproducts are used are, to varying degrees, highly cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns. Although we believe there will be a long-term expansion of demand for our products in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and powergenerating industries, there are cyclical downturns which occur. Previous cyclical downturns have lasted from one to several years. A sustained or renewed deterioration in any of the industries we serve would materially harm our business andoperating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities. We serve markets that are capital intensive. Volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets andadverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our operating results. Such volatility and disruption may also negatively impact our ability to access additional financing if and when needed. In the recent past, the state of the capital and credit markets caused a slow-down in spending by our customers and manyof them continue to evaluate their project plans. If adverse economic and credit conditions return, we would likely experience decreased revenue from our operations attributable to decreases in the spending levels of our customers. Moreover, adverseeconomic and credit conditions might also have a negative adverse effect on our cash flows if customers demand that we accept smaller project deposits and less frequent progress payments. In addition, adverse economic and credit conditions couldlead to downward pricing pressure. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets could also have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, should wedetermine such financing is desirable to maintain or expand our business or effectively pursue our business strategy.  The larger markets we serve are the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries which are both cyclical in nature and dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas and the relationshipbetween the two prices. As a result, volatility in the price of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results.  Although we believe that the global consumption of crude oil and natural gas will increase over the course of the next 20 years and that such increased consumption will result in a need to continuallyincrease global capacity, the prices of crude oil and natural gas have historically been very volatile. Many of our products are purchased in connection with oil refinery construction, revamps and upgrades. During times of significant volatility inthe market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers may refrain from placing orders until the market   6 Table of Contentsstabilizes. If our customers refrain from placing orders, we could experience decreased revenue from our operations attributable to decreases in the spending levels of our customers, which couldhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  A change in our end usecustomers or a change in the engineering procurement and construction companies serving our markets could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results. Although we have a long term relationship with many of our end use customers and with many engineering, procurement andconstruction companies, the project management requirements, pricing levels and costs to support each customer and customer type can be different. As our markets continue to grow, and new market opportunities expand, we could see a shift in pricingand a shift of costs, which may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial results.  The change in the relationship between various energy sources may affect our business. The relative costs of oil, natural gas, nuclear power, hydro power and numerous forms of alternative energyproduction may have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results.  Global andregional energy supply comes from many sources, such as: oil, natural gas, coal, hyrdo, nuclear, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, among others. A cost or supply shift among these sources could impact our business opportunities going forward. Ademand shift, where technological advances favor the utilization of one or a few sources of energy may impact demand for our products. If demand shifts in a manner that increases energy utilization outside of our traditional customer base orexpertise, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.  Our business ishighly competitive. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and compete against entities with greater resources than us or competitors who have a relative cost advantage, we risk losing market share to current and futurecompetitors.  We encounter competition in all of our markets. Some of our present and potentialcompetitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and changes in customer demands and they may be able todevote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products than we are able to. Certain of our competitors may also have a cost advantage compared to us, and be able to respond to customer needs at lower pricing levels.This may affect our ability to secure business and maintain our level of profitability. In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third partiesthat increase their ability to address the needs of our customers. Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of lower cost suppliers. If we cannot compete successfully against current orfuture competitors, our business will be materially adversely affected.  The loss of, or significantreduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations.  A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to our top ten customers accounted for 41%, 43% and 46% of consolidated sales in fiscal2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders oranticipated spending by such customers or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. A large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic, political,regulatory and other risks of international operations.  For fiscal 2013, 47% of our revenue was fromcustomers located outside of the U.S. Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary and a sales office in China. We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S.   7 Table of Contentswill continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitableopportunities become available. Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:      nationalization of private enterprises and assets;     political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the ongoing instability throughout the Middle East;     differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;     the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growthstrategy;      credit risks;      currency fluctuations;      tariff and tax increases;      export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;     shipping products during times of crisis or wars;      our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and     other factors inherent in foreign operations. Global demand growth is likely to be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit margins andincreased competition.  The increase in global demand is likely to be led by emerging markets. As aresult, we could face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products. Customers in emerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customersin the U.S. and certain of the other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are forced to compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers, our results of operationscould be materially adversely affected.  The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adverselyaffected by Chinas evolving economic, political and social conditions.  We conduct our businessin China primarily through a wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to evolving economic, political and social developments in China. In particular, the results ofoperations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political, economic and social conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in theinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation. In addition, changes indemand could result from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers for Chinese end users. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable tonon-Chinese owned market participants such as us are continually changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.  Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China, which could harm ourbusiness.  Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many ofour other major markets and limited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Although we take precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual property, any local design ormanufacture of products that we undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that   8 Table of Contentsunauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounterpatent or trademark infringers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary. Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. There areuncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have limited precedential value. Because many laws and regulations arerelatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative inexperience of Chinas judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertaintyas to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political agendas. Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may beuncertain and sporadic. For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain swift or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and resultsof operations.  Changes in energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business. Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidlyand we anticipate that energy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur. The eliminationof, or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.Government subsidies or taxes, which favor or disfavor certain energy sources compared with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. New regulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limitthe supply and/or increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.  OnAugust 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by companiesfiling public reports. The new rule, which is effective for the 2013 calendar year and requires a disclosure report to be filed by May 31, 2014, will require companies to perform due diligence, disclose, and report whether such mineralsoriginate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products. Moreover, thenumber of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be significant costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements. We may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevantconflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which could harm our reputation.  Efforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in government cutbacks in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduceddemand for our products, which could harm our business and results of operations.  Our businessstrategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S. In recent years the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget deficits. In the event thatU.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. Theimpact of such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as well as our growth opportunities.   9 Table of ContentsChanges in tax policies and tax rates in the U.S. could result inadverse impacts for domestic manufacturing investments, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Our business is dependent on significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and the impact of changes to U.S. tax policyaround investment and capital spending depreciation could reduce our customers willingness to invest in domestic capacity. The impact of such reductions could have a materially adverse affect on our business and operations. Political and regulatory developments could make the utilization and growth of nuclear power as an energy sourceless desirable, which would harm the business and results of operations of our subsidiary Energy Steel. On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake and tsunami struck Japan and caused substantial damage to the nucleargenerating units at the Fukushima Daiichi generating plant. The events in Japan have created uncertainties worldwide regarding, among other things, the desirability of operating existing nuclear power plants and building new or replacement nuclearpower plants. Should public opinion or political pressure result in the closing of existing nuclear facilities or otherwise result in the failure of the nuclear power industry to grow, especially within the U.S., the business, results of operationsand growth prospects of our subsidiary Energy Steel in the nuclear market could be materially adversely impacted.  In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, continues to perform additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S. It is possible that the NRC could take actionor impose regulations that adversely affects the demand for Energy Steels products and services, or otherwise delays or prohibits construction of new nuclear power generation facilities, even temporarily. If any such event were to occur, thebusiness or operations of Energy Steel could be materially adversely impacted.  A change in supply orcost of the materials used in our products could harm our profit margins.  Our profitability depends inpart on the price and continuity of supply of the materials used in the manufacture of our products, which in many instances are supplied by a limited number of sources. The availability and costs of these commodities may be influenced by, amongother things, market forces of supply and demand, changes in world politics, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, export quotas, and inflation. Any restrictions on the supply of the materials used by us in manufacturing ourproducts could significantly reduce our profit margins, which could harm our results of operations. Likewise, any efforts we may engage in to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by entering into long-term purchaseagreements, by implementing productivity improvements or by passing cost increases on to our customers may not be successful. In addition, the ability of our suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can also impact our ability to meetcommitments to customers. Future shortages or lower cost of raw materials could result in decreased sales as well as margins, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business. If we are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production during times when we are experiencing strongdemand, our results of operations might be adversely affected. In addition, outsourcing may negatively affect our profit margins.  Part of our business strategy calls for us to increase manufacturing capacity through outsourcing selected fabrication processes. We could experience difficulty in outsourcing if customers demand that ourproducts be manufactured by us exclusively. Furthermore, our ability to effectively outsource production could be adversely affected by worldwide manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to effectively outsource our production capacity whencircumstances warrant, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected and we might not be able to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. In addition, any disputes between us and the entities that we outsource to maydelay our ability to fulfill our obligations to our customers, which may harm our reputation and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, outsourcing to complete our products and services canincrease the costs associated with such products and services. If we rely too heavily on outsourcing and are not able to increase our own production capacity during times when there is high demand for our products and services, our profit marginsmay be negatively impacted.   10 Table of ContentsOur exposure to fixed-price contracts could negatively impact ourresults of operations.  A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, whichmay involve long-term fixed price commitments to customers. While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, cost overruns,supplier failures and customer disputes. To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these orother contracts prove to be inaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability from a particular contract may decrease or losses may be incurred, which, in turn, could have a material adverseeffect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject to contract cancellations and delaysby our customers, which may adversely affect our operating results.  The dollar amount of our backlogas of March 31, 2013 was $85,768. Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing of large orders, and the amount of our backlog at March 31, 2013 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which ourbacklog will be recognized as sales. Although historically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders.We cannot predict whether cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future. Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurredon cancelled contracts, cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations. Moreover, delay of contractexecution by our customers can result in volatility in our operating results.  Three orders in our backlog,which include the U.S. Navy project and projects for new U.S. nuclear reactors, are expected to account for approximately 10-15% of fiscal 2014 revenue. A delay or cancellation in any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness and results of operations.  If we lose any member of our management team and we experiencedifficulty in finding a qualified replacement our business would be harmed.  Competition for qualifiedmanagement and key technical and sales personnel in our industry is intense. Moreover, our technology is highly specialized and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical personnel. Many of the companies with which wecompete for management and key technical and sales personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live. If we are not able to retainany of our key management, technical or sales personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase business risk.  The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identify suitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close acquisition transactions. Inaddition, our success depends in part on our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historical business, operations and management. We cannot provide any assurances that we willbe able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties, including unanticipated costs, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or otherrelationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our managements attention, failure to integrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, as part ofthe integration process, we must incorporate an acquisitions existing business culture and compensation structure with our existing business. If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisitions business and operations into ourorganization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could have a material adverse effecton our business or results of operations.   11 Table of ContentsOur intangible assets substantially increased as a result of ouracquisition of Energy Steel. Should a portion of these intangible assets be impaired, results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel. The value of theseintangible assets may increase in the future if we complete additional acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy. We are required to review our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicatorsof permanent impairment arise. Factors that could indicate that our intangible assets are impaired could include, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, andslower than expected growth rates in our markets. If a portion of our intangible assets becomes impaired as a result of such a review, the impaired portion of such assets would have to be written-off during that period. Such a write-off could have amaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  If we are unable to make necessarycapital investments or respond to pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.  In order to remaincompetitive, we need to invest continuously in manufacturing, customer service and support, research and development and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not have availablesufficient financial or other resources to continue to make the investments necessary to lower our production costs and help us maintain our competitive position, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. If we fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to keep abreast of technologicalchanges in our markets, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.  Althoughtechnologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are well established, we believe our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new products in order to continue to meet customer demands. Ourfailure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis, or the development of processes that make our existing technologies or products obsolete could have a material adverse effect on our business and results ofoperations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon theintellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.  Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect ourproprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer. We may also be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Similarly,if we were found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverseengineer our technologies or design around our proprietary technologies. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietaryinformation, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us anddivert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual propertyand proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations.   12 Table of ContentsIf we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims,our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  The manufacture andsale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems notmanufactured or sold by us. For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances,personal injury or property damage.  Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limitour damages may not be enforceable or may fail to protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances. Our insurance may not cover all liabilities nor may our historicalexperience reflect any liabilities we may face in the future. We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, or at all. Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts orby insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  Furthermore, if acustomer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not at fault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur significant warranty claims, which are not covered by insurance. In the event acustomer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results. We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of thecountries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars. Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that basetheir prices on relatively weaker currencies. Business lost due to competition for orders against competitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified. In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by usin a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changesin currency exchange rates. In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle theobligation. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. At March 31, 2013, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in our effective tax rate and tax policies may impact our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and China. A change in tax laws or interpretation of tax laws,introduction of new tax accounting standards and regulation, our global mix of earnings, the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in uncertain positions could affect our effective tax rate and impact the financial performance of thecompany. Changes in tax laws of other jurisdictions could impact the profitability of our competitors, which could affect our competitive position relative to those competitors. Security threats and other sophisticated computer intrusions could harm our information systems, which in turncould harm our business and financial results.  We utilize information systems and computer technologythroughout our business. We store sensitive data, proprietary information and perform engineering designs and calculations on these systems. Information systems are subject to threats and sophisticated computer crimes, which pose a risk to thestability and security of our business. A failure or breach in security could expose our company as well as our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of information, compromising confidential information and technology, destruction of data,production disruptions and other business risks which could damage our reputation, competitive position and financial results of our operations. In addition, defending ourselves against these threats may increase costs or slow operationalefficiencies of our business. If any of the foregoing were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.   13 Table of ContentsWe face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims. We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos orasbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us. For example, a claim could be made undervarious regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination. Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which couldhave a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Any failure to comply withthe United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could adversely impact our competitive position and subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences, which could harm our business and results of operations. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engagingin bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Many foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. Corruption, extortion, bribery,pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain of the jurisdictions in which we may operate or sell our products. While we strictly prohibit our employees and agents from engaging in such conduct and haveestablished procedures, controls and training to prevent such conduct from occurring, it is possible that our employees or agents will engage in such conduct and that we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are alleged or arefound to have engaged in such practices, we could incur significant costs and suffer severe penalties or other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders abilityto change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger,takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. Such provisions include:     We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.    Under our certificate ofincorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock. We could issueshares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.     Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.    Our bylaws provide for a classified Board ofDirectors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors.     Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.    Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bringbusiness before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting. Such advance noticeprovisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.     Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of controltransaction.    Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any   14 Table of Contents  merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote. In addition,a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.      Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.    Our certificate of incorporation containsprovisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposedamendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board. This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be intheir best interests without approval of our Board.      Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.    Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend ourbylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.  "
12,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2012-06-07,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
  Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below or elsewhere in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also harm our business and results ofoperations.   5 Table of ContentsRisks related to our business The industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in such industries may adversely affect our operatingresults.  Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from the sale of ourproducts to companies in the chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating industries and to the U.S. Department of Defense, or to firms that design and construct facilities for these industries. The core industries in which ourproducts are used are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically experienced severe downturns. Although we believe there will be a long-term expansion of demand for our products in the petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generatingindustries, during 2008 we entered a sudden downturn in the demand for our products. Historically, previous cyclical downturns have lasted from one to several years. Although the downturn that began in 2008 appears to have begun to moderate and wehave seen signals of economic recovery in our markets, we have no way to predict whether any recovery will be sustainable. A renewed downturn could force us to reduce our infrastructure, which would make it difficult for us to quickly recover in thesubsequent up cycle. A sustained or renewed deterioration in any of the cyclical industries we serve would materially harm our business and operating results because our customers would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase ourproducts, nor would they likely have the need to build additional facilities or improve existing facilities. We serve markets that are capital intensive. Volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets andadverse changes in the global economy may negatively impact our operating results. Such volatility and disruption may also negatively impact our ability to access additional financing if and when needed. Although we believe that our long-term growth prospects remain strong, we also expect that the recent state of the capitaland credit markets caused a slow-down in spending by our customers as many of them continue to evaluate their project plans. Although we believe that we are in the initial stages of an economic recovery, if adverse economic and credit conditionspersist, return or worsen, we would likely experience decreased revenue from our operations attributable to decreases in the spending levels of our customers. Moreover, adverse economic and credit conditions might also have a negative adverse effecton our cash flows if customers demand that we accept smaller project deposits and less frequent progress payments. In addition, adverse economic and credit conditions could put downward pricing pressure on us. Any of the foregoing could have amaterial adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  Adverse conditions in the capital andcredit markets could also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, should we determine such financing is desirable to maintain or expand our business. The larger markets we serve are the petroleum refining and petrochemical industries which are both cyclical innature and dependent on the price of crude oil and natural gas. As a result, volatility in the price of oil and natural gas may negatively impact our operating results. Although we believe that the global consumption of crude oil and natural gas will increase over the course of the next 20years and that such increased consumption will result in a need to continually increase global capacity, the price of crude oil and natural gas has been very volatile. Many of our products are purchased in connection with oil refinery construction,revamps and upgrades. During times of significant volatility in the market for crude oil or natural gas, our customers may refrain from placing orders until the market stabilizes. If our customers refrain from placing orders, we could experiencedecreased revenue from our operations attributable to decreases in the spending levels of our customers. Our business is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and competeagainst entities with greater resources than us, we risk losing market share to current and future competitors.  Some of our present and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to newtechnologies or   6 Table of Contentsprocesses and changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can. Competitors may have a costadvantage and be able to respond to customer needs at a lower pricing level. This may affect our ability to secure business and maintain our level of profitability. In addition, our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitionsor establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that increase their ability to address the needs of our customers. Moreover, customer buying patterns can change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting oflow cost suppliers. If we cannot compete successfully against current or future competitors, our business will be materially harmed.  The loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our results of operations. A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to ourtop ten customers accounted for 43%, 46% and 44% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeablefuture. The loss of any of our major customers, a decrease or delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers, or a delay in the production of existing orders could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. A large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to the economic,political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.  For fiscal 2012, 46% of our revenuewas from customers located outside of the U.S. Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary and a facility in China. We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenuefor the foreseeable future. We intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available. Our foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a result of:     nationalization of private enterprises and assets;     political or economic instability in certain countries and regions, such as the recent uprisings and instability throughout the Middle East;     differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights;     the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growthstrategy;      credit risks;      currency fluctuations;      tariff and tax increases;      export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments;     shipping products during times of crisis or wars;      our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and     other factors inherent in foreign operations. The global economic recovery is likely to be led by emerging markets, which could result in lower profit marginsand increased competition.  A global economic recovery is likely to be led by emerging markets. In theevent that a global economic recovery is led by emerging markets, we could face increased competition from lower cost suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on our products. In addition, if the global economic recovery is led byemerging markets, the pace of such recovery could be slower than the pace of prior recoveries. Customers in   7 Table of Contentsemerging markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain of the other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are forcedto compete for business with customers that place less emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current customers or the pace of any economic recovery is slower than the pace of prior recoveries, our results of operations could bematerially adversely impacted.  The operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected byChinas evolving economic, political and social conditions.  We conduct our business in Chinaprimarily through a wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to evolving economic, political and social developments in China. In particular, the results of operations ofour Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in Chinas political, economic and social conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation ofexisting laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the rates or methods of taxation. In addition, changes in demand couldresult from increased competition from local Chinese manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred suppliers. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market participants such asus are rapidly changing. These laws, regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a material adverse effect on our business. Intellectual property rights are difficult to enforce in China. Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with the commercial law in many of our other major markets andlimited protection of intellectual property is available in China as a practical matter. Although we take precautions in the operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual property, any local design or manufacture of products thatwe undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We may also have limited legal recourse in the event weencounter patent or trademark infringers.  Uncertainties with respect to the Chinese legal system mayadversely affect the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.  Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to lawsand regulations applicable to foreign investment in China. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior court decisionshave limited precedential value. Because many laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative inexperienceof Chinas judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Finally,enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic. For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain swift or equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect companies like ours. Changes in energy policy regulations could adversely affect our business. Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate thatenergy policy will continue to be an important legislative priority in the jurisdictions where we sell our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the changes in energy policy that could occur. The elimination of, or a change in,any of the current rules and regulations in any of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes our end users less likely to purchase our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.   8 Table of ContentsEfforts to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result ingovernment cutbacks in defense spending or in reduced incentives to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced demand for our products.  Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in the alternative energy markets in the U.S. In recent years the U.S. federalgovernment has incurred large budget deficits. In the event that the U.S. federal government defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce federal budget deficits, projectsrelated to defense or alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of such reductions could have an adverse affect on our business growth opportunities. Changes in tax policies and tax rates in the U.S. could result in adverse impacts for domestic manufacturinginvestments, resulting in reduced demand for our products.  Our business is dependent on significantmanufacturing investment in the U.S. and the impact of changes to U.S. tax policy around investment and capital spending depreciation can reduce our customers willingness to invest in domestic capacity. The impact of such reductions could havea materially adverse affect on our business and operations.  Political and regulatory developments couldmake the utilization and growth of nuclear power as an energy source less desirable.  On March 11,2011, a major earthquake and tsunami struck Japan and caused substantial damage to the nuclear generating units at the Fukushima Daiichi generating plant. The events in Japan have created uncertainties worldwide regarding, among other things, thedesirability of operating existing nuclear power plants and building new or replacement nuclear power plants. Should public opinion or political pressure result in the closing of existing nuclear facilities or otherwise result in the failure of thenuclear power industry to grow, especially within the U.S., the business and growth prospects of Energy Steel could be materially adversely impacted.  In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or NRC, continues to perform additional operational and safety reviews of nuclear facilities in the U.S. It is possible that the NRC could take actionor impose regulations that adversely affects the demand for Energy Steels products and services, or otherwise delays or prohibits construction of new nuclear power generation facilities, even temporarily. If any such event were to occur, thebusiness or operations of Energy Steel could be materially adversely impacted.  A decrease in supply orcost of the materials used in our products could harm our profit margins.  Our profitability depends inpart on the price and continuity of supply of the materials used in the manufacture of our products, which in many instances are supplied by a limited number of sources. The availability and costs of these commodities may be influenced by, amongother things, market forces of supply and demand, changes in world politics, labor relations between the producers and their work forces, export quotas, and inflation. Any restrictions on the supply of the materials used by us in manufacturing ourproducts could significantly reduce our profit margins, which could harm our results of operations. Likewise, any efforts we may engage in to mitigate restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by entering into long-term purchaseagreements, by implementing productivity improvements or by passing cost increases on to our customers may not be successful. In addition, the ability of our suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can also impact our ability to meetcommitments to customers. Future shortages or lower cost of raw materials could result in decreased sales as well as margins, or otherwise materially adversely affect our business. If we are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production during times when we are experiencing strongdemand, our results of operations might be adversely affected. In addition, outsourcing may negatively affect our profit margins.  When we experience strong demand for our products, our business strategy calls for us to increase manufacturing capacity through outsourcing selected fabrication processes. We could experience difficultyin out-  9 Table of Contentssourcing if customers demand that our products be manufactured by us exclusively. Furthermore, our ability to effectively outsource production could be adversely affected by worldwidemanufacturing capacity. If we are unable to effectively outsource our production capacity when circumstances warrant, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected and we might not be able to deliver products to our customers on atimely basis. In addition, outsourcing to complete our products and services can increase the costs associated with such products and services. If we rely too heavily on outsourcing and are not able to increase our own production capacity duringtimes when there is high demand for our products and services, our profit margins may be negatively impacted. Our exposure to fixed-price contracts could negatively impact our results of operations. A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price contracts, which may involve long-term fixed pricecommitments to customers. While we believe our contract management processes are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in executing large contracts, including but not limited to, cost overruns, supplier failures and customerdisputes. To the extent that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties successfully assert claims against us, the original cost estimates in these or other contracts prove to beinaccurate or the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our customers, our profitability from a particular contract may decrease or losses may be incurred, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to contract cancellations and delays by our customers, which may adversely affect ouroperating results.  The dollar amount of our backlog as of March 31, 2012 was $94,934. Our backlogcan be significantly affected by the timing of large orders, and the amount of our backlog at March 31, 2012 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales. Althoughhistorically the amount of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared with our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders. We cannot predict whether cancellations willoccur or accelerate in the future. Although certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts, cancellations ofpurchase orders or modifications made to existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of operations. Moreover, delay of contract execution by our customers can result involatility in our operating results.  Three orders in our backlog which include the U.S. Navy project andprojects for new U.S. nuclear plants, are expected to account for approximately 15% of fiscal 2013 revenue. A delay or cancellation in any of these projects could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The loss of any member of our management team and our inability to make up for such loss with a qualifiedreplacement could harm our business.  Competition for qualified management and key technical personnelin our industry is intense. Moreover our technology is highly specialized and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any of our key technical personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for management and key technical personnel havegreater financial and other resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live. If we are not able to retain any of our key management or technical personnel, our businesscould be materially harmed.  Our acquisition strategy may not be successful or may increase businessrisk.  The success of our acquisition strategy will depend, in part, on our ability to identifysuitable companies or businesses to purchase and then successfully negotiate and close the acquisition. In addition, our ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the anticipated benefits from combining the acquisition with our historicalbusiness, operations and management. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete the acquisitions and then integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering difficulties,  10 Table of Contentsincluding unanticipated costs, difficulty in retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure to retain key employees, diversion of our managements attention, failure tointegrate information and accounting systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, as part of the integration process, we must incorporate an acquisitions existing business culture andcompensation structure with our existing business. If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisitions business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of theacquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could materially harm our business or results of operations. Our acquisition of Energy Steel might subject us to unknown liabilities. Energy Steel may have unknown liabilities, including, but not limited to, product liability, workers compensationliability, tax liability and liability for improper business practices. Although we are entitled to indemnification from the seller of Energy Steel for these and other matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we couldincur material liabilities for the past activities of Energy Steel. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could materially harm our business or results of operations. Our intangible assets substantially increased as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel. Should a portion ofthese intangible assets be impaired, results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Ourbalance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel. The value of these intangible assets may increase in the future if wecomplete additional acquisitions as part of our overall business strategy. We are required to review our intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain indicators of permanent impairment arise. Factors that couldindicate that our intangible assets are impaired could include, among other things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, lower than projected operating results and cash flows, and slower than expected growth rates in our markets.If a portion of our intangible assets becomes impaired as a result of such a review, the impaired portion of such assets would have to be written-off during that period. Such a write-off could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations.  If we are unable to make necessary capital investments or respond to pricing pressures, ourbusiness may be harmed.  In order to remain competitive, we need to invest continuously inmanufacturing, customer service and support, research and development and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not have available sufficient financial or other resources tocontinue to make investments, necessary to lower our production costs and help us maintain our competitive position, which would materially harm our business.  If we fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to keep abreast of technological changes in our markets, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Although technologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are well established, we believe ourfuture success depends, in part, on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new products in order to continue to meet customer demands. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis, or thedevelopment of processes that make our existing technologies or products obsolete, could materially harm our business and results of operations.  If third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending ourrights or suffer competitive injury.  Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. Werely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive positioncould suffer. We may also be   11 Table of Contentsrequired to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Similarly, if we were found to have unintentionally infringed on the intellectual property rightsof others, our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around our patents. Any of theforegoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  In some instances,litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claimsbrought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, any intellectual propertylitigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing orselling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could materially harm our business and results of operations.  If we become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential product liability claims, including those that may arisefrom failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction of, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us. For example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerousprocesses and the misapplication, improper installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage. Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may failto protect us from liability for damages and we may not negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain circumstances. Although we carry liability insurance that we believe is adequate to protect us from product liability claims basedon our historical experience, our insurance may not cover all liabilities nor may our historical experience reflect any liabilities we may face in the future. We also may not be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or onreasonable terms, or at all. Any material liability not covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an event related to one of our products, even if we are not atfault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur significant warranty claims, which are not covered by insurance. In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived oractual, or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  We are subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our operating results.  We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on U.S. dollars.Currency movements can affect sales in several ways, the foremost being our ability to compete for orders against foreign competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker currencies. Business lost due to competition for orders againstcompetitors using a relatively weaker currency cannot be quantified. In addition, cash can be adversely impacted by the conversion of sales made by us in a foreign currency to U.S. dollars. While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges fromtime to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. In addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do notfulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation. At March 31, 2012, we held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts.   12 Table of ContentsWe face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar claims. We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging illnesses from exposure to asbestos orasbestos-containing products and seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in the future.In addition, because some of our products are used in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could result in litigation against us. For example, a claim could be made undervarious regulations for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination. Any litigation brought against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which couldmaterially harm our business and results of operations.  Risks related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impair or delay stockholders abilityto change our management and could discourage takeover transactions that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.  Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could discourage others from initiating a potential merger,takeover or other change of control transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. Such provisions include:     We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse to our common stock.    Under our certificate ofincorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common stock. We could issueshares of preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.     Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given year.    Our bylaws provide for a classified Board ofDirectors, with only approximately one-third of our Board elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult to effect a change of control because at least two annual stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our directors.     Our bylaws contain advance notice requirements.    Our bylaws also provide that any stockholder who wishes to bringbusiness before an annual meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the meeting. Such advance noticeprovisions may have the effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.     Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority voting to approve a change of control transaction.    Seventy-five percent of our outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets and similar transactions if the other party to such transaction owns 5% or more of ourshares entitled to vote. In addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any such transaction.     Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require supermajority voting.    Our certificate of incorporation containsprovisions that make its amendment require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our shares unless the proposedamendment was previously recommended to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board. This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might otherwise consider to be intheir best interests without approval of our Board.   13 Table of Contents   Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority voting.    Although our Board of Directors is permitted to amend ourbylaws at any time, our stockholders may only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or more of our shares.This provision makes it more difficult for our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be in their best interests without approval of our Board.  "
11,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2011-06-03,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many    of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report    on    Form 10-K.    If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K    occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.    Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known    to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also    harm our business and results of operations.    5Table of ContentsRisks    related to our business The    industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in    such industries may adversely affect our operating    results.     Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been    derived from the sale of our products to companies in the    chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating    industries and the U.S. Department of Defense, or to firms    that design and construct facilities for these industries. The    core industries in which our products are used are, to varying    degrees, cyclical and have historically experienced severe    downturns. Although we believe there will be a long-term    expansion of demand for our products in the petrochemical,    petroleum refining and power generating industries, during    fiscal 2008 we entered a sudden downturn in the demand for our    products. Historically, previous cyclical downturns have lasted    from one to several years. Although the downturn that began in    fiscal 2008 has begun to moderate and we have seen recent    signals of economic recovery in our markets, we have no way to    predict whether any recovery will be sustainable. A longer than    normal down cycle could force us to reduce our infrastructure,    which would make it difficult for us to quickly recover in the    subsequent up cycle. A sustained or renewed deterioration in any    of the cyclical industries we serve would materially harm our    business and operating results because our customers would not    likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products,    nor would they likely have the need to build additional    facilities or improve existing facilities. We    serve markets that are capital intensive. Volatility and    disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes    in the global economy may negatively impact our operating    results. Such volatility and disruption may also negatively    impact our ability to access additional financing.     Although we believe that our long-term growth prospects remain    strong, we also expect that the recent state of the capital and    credit markets caused a slow-down in spending by our customers    as they continue to evaluate their project plans. Although we    believe that we are in the initial stages of an economic    recovery, if adverse economic and credit conditions persist,    return or worsen, we would likely experience decreased revenue    from our operations attributable to decreases in the spending    levels of our customers. Moreover, adverse economic and credit    conditions might also have a negative adverse effect on our cash    flows if customers demand that we accept smaller project    deposits and less frequent progress payments. In addition,    adverse economic and credit conditions could put downward    pricing pressure on us. Any of the foregoing could have a    material adverse effect on our business and results of    operations.     Adverse conditions in the capital and credit markets could also    have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional    financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, should we    determine such financing is desirable to maintain or expand our    business. The    larger markets we serve are the petroleum refining and    petrochemical industries which are both cyclical in nature and    dependent on the price of crude oil. As a result, volatility in    the price of oil may negatively impact our operating    results.     Although we believe that the global consumption of crude oil    will increase over the course of the next 20 years and that    such increased consumption will result in a need to continually    increase global oil refining capacity, the price of crude oil    has been very volatile. Many of our products are purchased in    connection with oil refinery construction, revamps and upgrades.    During times of significant volatility in the market for crude    oil, our customers may refrain from placing orders until the    market stabilizes. During such times of high volatility, we    could experience decreased revenue from our operations    attributable to decreases in the spending levels of our    customers. A    large percentage of our sales occur outside of the U.S. As a    result, we are subject to the economic, political, regulatory    and other risks of international operations.     For fiscal 2011, 55% of our revenue was from customers located    outside of the U.S. Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary and    have facilities in China. We believe that revenue from the sale    of our products outside the U.S. will continue to account    for a significant portion of our total revenue for the    foreseeable future. We intend to continue to    6Table of Contents    expand our international operations to the extent that suitable    opportunities become available. Our foreign operations and sales    could be adversely affected as a result of:           nationalization of private enterprises and assets;           political or economic instability in certain countries and    regions, such as the recent uprisings and instability throughout    the Middle East;           differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in    protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement    of contract rights;           the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations    or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our    business and growth strategy;           credit risks;           currency fluctuations;           tariff and tax increases;           export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of    foreign governments;           shipping products during times of crisis or wars;           our failure to comply with United States laws regarding doing    business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act; and           other factors inherent in foreign operations. We are    subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely    affect our operating results.     We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the    U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we    sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on    U.S. dollars. As such, fluctuations in currency exchange    rates, which cause the value of the dollar to increase, could    have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our    business. While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges    from time to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we    cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our    earnings are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. In    addition, if the counter-parties to such exchange contracts do    not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contractual foreign    currencies, we could be at risk for fluctuations, if any,    required to settle the obligation. At March 31, 2011, we    held no forward foreign currency exchange contracts. Efforts    to reduce large U.S. federal budget deficits could result in    government cutbacks in defense spending or in reduced incentives    to pursue alternative energy projects, resulting in reduced    demand for our products.     Our business strategy calls for us to continue to pursue    defense-related projects as well as projects for end users in    the alternative energy markets in the U.S. In recent years    the U.S. federal government has incurred large budget    deficits. In the event that the U.S. federal government    defense spending is reduced or alternative energy related    incentives are reduced or eliminated in an effort to reduce    federal budget deficits, projects related to defense or    alternative energy may become less plentiful. The impact of such    reductions could have a materially adverse affect on our    business and operations. Changes    in tax policies and tax rates in the U.S. could result in    adverse impacts for domestic manufacturing investments,    resulting in reduced demand for our products.     Our business is dependent on significant manufacturing    investment in the U.S. and the impact of changes to    U.S. tax policy around investment and capital spending    depreciation can reduce our customers willingness to    invest in domestic capacity. The impact of such reductions could    have a materially adverse affect on our business and operations.    7Table of ContentsIf we    fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to    keep abreast of technological changes in our markets, our    business and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     Although technologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are    well established, we believe our future success depends, in    part, on our ability to enhance our existing products and    develop new products in order to continue to meet customer    demands. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a    timely and cost-competitive basis, or the development of    processes that make our existing technologies or products    obsolete, could materially harm our business and results of    operations. The    loss of any member of our management team and our inability to    make up for such loss with a qualified replacement could harm    our business.     Competition for qualified management and key technical personnel    in our industry is intense. Moreover our technology is highly    specialized and it may be difficult to replace the loss of any    of our key technical personnel. Many of the companies with which    we compete for management and key technical personnel have    greater financial and other resources than we do or are located    in geographic areas which may be considered by some to be more    desirable places to live. If we are not able to retain any of    our key management or technical personnel, our business could be    materially harmed. Our    business is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully    implement our business strategy and compete against entities    with greater resources than us, we risk losing market share to    current and future competitors.     Some of our present and potential competitors may have    substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or    manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to    respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and    changes in customer demands and they may be able to devote    greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of    their products than we can. In addition, our current and    potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or    establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with    third parties that increase their ability to address the needs    of our customers. Moreover, customer buying patterns can change    if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of low    cost suppliers. If we cannot compete successfully against    current or future competitors, our business will be materially    harmed. If we    are unable to make necessary capital investments or respond to    pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.     In order to remain competitive, we need to invest continuously    in manufacturing, customer service and support, research and    development and marketing. From time to time we also have to    adjust the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may    not have available sufficient financial or other resources to    continue to make investments necessary to maintain our    competitive position, which would materially harm our business. If    third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we    were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third    parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or    defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.     Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We    rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade    secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and    protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully    enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive    position could suffer. We may also be required to spend    significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual    property rights. Similarly, if we were found to have    unintentionally infringed on the intellectual property rights of    others, our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore,    other companies may develop technologies that are similar or    superior to our technologies, duplicate or reverse engineer our    technologies or design around our patents. Any of the foregoing    could have a material adverse effect on our business and results    of operations.     In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our    intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary    information, or to defend against claims by third parties that    our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any    litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or    without merit, could result in    8Table of Contents    substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our    management, which could materially harm our business and results    of operations. In addition, any intellectual property litigation    or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of    our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to    significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on    unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling    certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any    of which could materially harm our business and results of    operations. We are    subject to contract cancellations and delays by our customers,    which may adversely affect our operating results.     The dollar amount of our backlog as of March 31, 2011 was    $91,096. Our backlog can be significantly affected by the timing    of large orders, and the amount of our backlog at March 31,    2011 is not necessarily indicative of future backlog levels or    the rate at which our backlog will be recognized as sales.    Although historically the amount of modifications and    terminations of our orders has not been material compared with    our total contract volume, customers can, and sometimes do,    terminate or modify their orders. We cannot predict whether    cancellations will occur or accelerate in the future. Although    certain of our contracts in backlog may contain provisions    allowing for us to assess cancellation charges to our customers    to compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled contracts,    cancellations of purchase orders or modifications made to    existing contracts could substantially and materially reduce our    backlog and, consequently, our future sales and results of    operations. Moreover, delay of contract execution by our    customers can result in volatility in our operating results.     Two orders in our backlog, the U.S. Navy project and a    Middle East refinery project, are expected to account for    approximately 25% of fiscal 2012 revenue. Any delay in either of    these projects could have a material adverse effect on our    results of operations. A    decrease in supply or cost of the materials used in our products    could harm our profit margins.     Our profitability depends in part on the price and continuity of    supply of the materials used in the manufacture of our products,    which in many instances are supplied by a limited number of    sources. The availability and costs of these commodities may be    influenced by, among other things, market forces of supply and    demand, changes in world politics, labor relations between the    producers and their work forces, export quotas, and inflation.    Any restrictions on the supply of the materials used by us in    manufacturing our products could significantly reduce our profit    margins, which could harm our results of operations. Likewise,    any efforts we may engage in to mitigate restrictions on the    supply or price increases of materials by entering into    long-term purchase agreements, by implementing productivity    improvements or by passing cost increases on to our customers    may not be successful. In addition, the ability of our suppliers    to meet quality and delivery requirements can also impact our    ability to meet commitments to customers. Future shortages or    price fluctuations in raw materials could result in decreased    sales as well as margins, or otherwise materially adversely    affect our business. The    loss of, or significant reduction or delay in, purchases by our    largest customers could reduce our revenue and adversely affect    our results of operations.     A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial    portion of our historical net sales. For example, sales to our    top ten customers accounted for 46%, 44% and 42% of consolidated    sales in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. We    expect that a limited number of customers will continue to    represent a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable    future. The loss of any of our major customers or a decrease or    delay in orders or anticipated spending by such customers could    materially adversely affect our revenues and results of    operations. Our    exposure to fixed-price contracts could negatively impact our    results of operations.     A substantial portion of our sales is derived from fixed-price    contracts, which may involve long-term fixed price commitments    to customers. While we believe our contract management processes    are strong, we nevertheless could experience difficulties in    executing large contracts, including but not limited to, cost    overruns, supplier failures and customer disputes. To the extent    that any of our fixed-price contracts are delayed, our    subcontractors fail to perform, contract counterparties    successfully assert claims against us, the original cost    estimates in these or other contracts prove to be inaccurate or    the contracts do not permit us to pass increased costs on to our    customers,    9Table of Contents    our profitability from a particular contract may decrease or    losses may be incurred, which, in turn, could adversely affect    our results of operations. If we    are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production    during times when we are experiencing strong demand, our results    of operations might be adversely affected. In addition,    outsourcing may negatively affect our profit    margins.     When we experience strong demand for our products, our business    strategy calls for us to increase manufacturing capacity through    outsourcing selected fabrication processes. We could experience    difficulty in outsourcing if customers demand that our products    be manufactured by us exclusively. Furthermore, our ability to    effectively outsource production could be adversely affected by    worldwide manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to    effectively outsource our production capacity when circumstances    warrant, our results of operations could be materially adversely    affected and we might not be able to deliver products to our    customers on a timely basis. In addition, outsourcing to    complete our products and services can increase the costs    associated with such products and services. If we rely too    heavily on outsourcing and are not able to increase our own    production capacity during times when there is high demand for    our products and services, our profit margins may be negatively    impacted. We    face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar    claims.     We are a defendant in several lawsuits alleging illnesses from    exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking    unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict    with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could    become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in    the future. In addition, because some of our products are used    in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any    failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could    result in litigation against us. For example, a claim could be    made under various regulations for the adverse consequences of    environmental contamination. Any litigation brought against us,    whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs    to us as well as divert the attention of our management, which    could materially harm our business and results of operations. If we    become subject to product liability, warranty or other claims,    our results of operations and financial condition could be    adversely affected.     The manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to potential    product liability claims, including those that may arise from    failure to meet product specifications, misuse or malfunction    of, design flaws in our products, or use of our products with    systems not manufactured or sold by us. For example, our    equipment is installed in facilities that operate dangerous    processes and the misapplication, improper installation or    failure of our equipment may result in exposure to potentially    hazardous substances, personal injury or property damage.     Provisions contained in our contracts with customers that    attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable or may fail    to protect us from liability for damages and we may not    negotiate such contractual limitations of liability in certain    circumstances. Although we carry liability insurance that we    believe is adequate to protect us from product liability claims    based on our historical experience, our insurance may not cover    all liabilities nor may our historical experience reflect any    liabilities we may face in the future. We also may not be able    to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or    on reasonable terms, or at all. Any material liability not    covered by provisions in our contracts or by insurance could    have a material adverse effect on our business and financial    condition.     Furthermore, if a customer suffers damage as a result of an    event related to one of our products, even if we are not at    fault, they may reduce their business with us. We may also incur    significant warranty claims, which are not covered by insurance.    In the event a customer ceases doing business with us as a    result of a product malfunction or defect, perceived or actual,    or if we incur significant warranty costs in the future, there    could be a material adverse effect on our business and results    of operations. Changes    in or enforcement of energy policy regulations could adversely    affect our business.     Energy policy in the U.S. and in the other countries where    we sell our products is evolving rapidly and we anticipate that    energy policy will continue to be an important legislative    priority in the jurisdictions where we sell    10Table of Contents    our products. It is difficult, if not impossible, to predict the    changes in energy policy that could occur. The elimination of,    or a change in, any of the current rules and regulations in any    of our markets could create a regulatory environment that makes    our end users less likely to purchase our products, which would    have a material adverse effect on our business. Any    global economic recovery may be led by emerging markets, which    could result in lower profit margins and increased    competition.     A global economic recovery may be led by emerging markets. In    the event that a global economic recovery is led by emerging    markets, we could face increased competition from lower cost    suppliers, which in turn could lead to lower profit margins on    our products. In addition, if the global economic recovery is    led by emerging markets, the pace of such recovery could be    slower than the pace of prior recoveries. Customers in emerging    markets may also place less emphasis on our high quality and    brand name than do customers in the U.S. and certain of the    other industrialized countries where we compete. If we are    forced to compete for business with customers that place less    emphasis on quality and brand recognition than our current    customers or the pace of any economic recovery is slower than    the pace of prior recoveries, our results of operations could be    materially adversely impacted. Risks    related to operating a subsidiary and doing business in    China     In addition to the factors identified above, the operation of    our Chinese subsidiary is subject to the following additional    risks: The    operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected    by Chinas evolving economic, political and social    conditions.     We conduct our business in China primarily through a    wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. The results of operations and    future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to    evolving economic, political and social developments in China.    In particular, the results of operations of our Chinese    subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things,    changes in Chinas political, economic and social    conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government,    changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of    existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange    regulations, measures that may be introduced to control    inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the    rates or methods of taxation. In addition, changes in demand    could result from increased competition from local Chinese    manufacturers who have cost advantages or who may be preferred    suppliers. Also, Chinese commercial laws, regulations and    interpretations applicable to non-Chinese owned market    participants such as us are rapidly changing. These laws,    regulations and interpretations could impose restrictions on our    ownership or operations of our interests in China and have a    material adverse effect on our business. Intellectual    property rights are difficult to enforce in China.     Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with    the commercial law in many of our other major markets and    limited protection of intellectual property is available in    China as a practical matter. Although we take precautions in the    operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual    property, any local design or manufacture of products that we    undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that    unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or    use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We    may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter    patent or trademark infringers. Uncertainties    with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect    the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.     Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations    applicable to foreign investment in China. There are    uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of    laws, rules and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is    based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have    limited precedential value. Because many laws and regulations    are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still    evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and    rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative    inexperience of Chinas judiciary in many cases creates    additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and    the interpretation of statutes and regulations    11Table of Contents    may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic    political changes. Finally, enforcement of existing laws or    contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.    For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain    swift and equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to    protect companies like ours. Risks    related to our acquisition and ownership of Energy    Steel & Supply Company     In addition to the factors identified above, the operation of    our subsidiary Energy Steel is subject to the following    additional risks: It may    be more difficult, costly or time-consuming to integrate our    historical business with the business of Energy Steel than we    expect.     On December 14, 2010, we acquired Energy Steel, a    fabrication and specialty machining company dedicated    exclusively to the nuclear power industry. The success of our    acquisition of Energy Steel will depend, in part, on our ability    to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating our    historical business, operations and management with the    business, operations and management of Energy Steel. We cannot    provide any assurances that we will be able to integrate the    business and operations of Energy Steel without encountering    difficulties, including unanticipated costs, difficulty in    retaining customers and supplier or other relationships, failure    to retain key employees, diversion of our managements    attention, failure to integrate information and accounting    systems or establish and maintain proper internal control over    financial reporting. Moreover, as part of the integration    process, we must conform Energy Steels existing business    culture and compensation structure with ours. If we are not able    to efficiently integrate Energy Steels business and    operations into our organization in a timely and efficient    manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of our acquisition    of Energy Steel may not be realized, or it may take longer to    realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which    could materially harm our business or results of operations. Our    acquisition of Energy Steel might subject us to unknown    liabilities.     Energy Steel may have unknown liabilities, including, but not    limited to, product liability, workers compensation    liability, tax liability and liability for improper business    practices. Although we are entitled to indemnification from the    seller of Energy Steel for these and other matters, we could    experience difficulty enforcing those obligations or we could    incur material liabilities for the past activities of Energy    Steel. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could    materially harm our business or results of operations. Political    and regulatory developments could make the utilization and    growth of nuclear power as an energy source less    desirable.     On March 11, 2011, a major earthquake and tsunami struck    Japan and caused substantial damage to the nuclear generating    units at the Fukushima Daiichi generating plant. The events in    Japan have created uncertainties worldwide regarding, among    other things, the desirability of operating existing nuclear    power plants and building new or replacement nuclear power    plants. Should public opinion or political pressure result in    the closing of existing nuclear facilities or otherwise result    in the failure of the nuclear power industry to grow, especially    within the U.S., the business and growth prospects of Energy    Steel could be materially adversely impacted.     In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or    NRC, plans to perform additional operational and safety reviews    of nuclear facilities in the U.S. It is possible that the    NRC could take action or impose regulations that adversely    affects the demand for Energy Steels products and    services, or otherwise delays or prohibits construction of new    nuclear power generation facilities, even temporarily. If any    such event were to occur, the business or operations of Energy    Steel could be materially adversely impacted. Our    intangible assets substantially increased as a result of our    acquisition of Energy Steel. Should a portion of these    intangible assets be impaired, results of operations could be    materially adversely affected.     Our balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill    and other separately identifiable intangible assets, primarily    as a result of our acquisition of Energy Steel. The value of    these intangible assets may increase in the future if we    complete additional acquisitions as part of our overall business    strategy. We are required to review our intangible assets for    impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if certain    indicators of permanent    12Table of Contents    impairment arise. Factors that could indicate that our    intangible assets are impaired could include, among other    things, a decline in our stock price and market capitalization,    lower than projected operating results and cash flows, and    slower than expected growth rates in our markets. If a portion    of our intangible assets becomes impaired as a result of such a    review, the impaired portion of such assets would have to be    written-off during that period. Such a write-off could have a    material adverse effect on our results of operations. Risks    related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions    contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could    impair or delay stockholders ability to change our    management and could discourage takeover transactions that our    stockholders might consider to be in their best    interests.     Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could    impede attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace our    management and could discourage others from initiating a    potential merger, takeover or other change of control    transaction, including a potential transaction at a premium over    the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders    might consider to be in their best interests. For example:       We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms    adverse to our common stock.  Under our    certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is    authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine    the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without    obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common    stock. We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and    conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the    holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying    or preventing a change in control of our company.       Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given    year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified    Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our    Board elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult    to effect a change of control because at least two annual    stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our    directors.       Our bylaws contain advance notice    requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that    any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual    meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for    election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders    must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the    meeting. Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of    making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder    meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.       Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority    voting to approve a change of control    transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our    outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any    merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our    assets and similar transactions if the other party to such    transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote. In    addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by    such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any    such transaction.       Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require    supermajority voting.  Our certificate of    incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment    require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding    shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to    vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our    shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended    to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.    This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to    our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might    otherwise consider to be in their best interests without    approval of our Board.       Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority    voting.  Although our Board of Directors is    permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may    only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of    our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the    shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or    more of our shares. This provision makes it more difficult for    our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be    in their best interests without approval of our Board.    13Table of Contents "
4,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2010-05-25,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks, many    of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report    on    Form 10-K.    If any of the events described below or elsewhere in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K    occur, our business and results of operations could be harmed.    Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known    to us, or which we currently deem to be immaterial, could also    harm our business and results of operations.    4Table of ContentsRisks    related to our business The    industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in    such industries may adversely affect our operating    results.     Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been    derived from the sale of our products to companies in the    chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating    industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for    these industries. The core industries in which our products are    used are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically    experienced severe downturns. Although we believe there will be    a long-term expansion of demand for our products in the    petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating    industries, during fiscal 2009, we entered a sudden downturn in    the demand for our products and services. Historically, previous    cyclical downturns have lasted from one to several years. We    have no way to predict or control the length or severity of the    current downturn. A longer than normal or deeper down cycle    could force us to reduce our infrastructure, which would make it    difficult for us to quickly recover in the subsequent up cycle.    This scenario would require us to rebuild our business and be    slower to gain market share back. A sustained deterioration in    any of the cyclical industries we serve would materially harm    our business and operating results because our customers would    not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products    nor would they likely have the need to build additional    facilities or improve existing facilities. We    serve markets that are capital intensive. The recent volatility    and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse    changes in the global economy may negatively impact our    operating results. Such volatility and disruption may also    negatively impact our ability to access additional    financing.     Although we believe that the fundamentals that have driven our    growth over the past several years remain essentially unchanged    and that our long-term growth prospects remain strong, we also    expect that the state of the capital and credit markets has    caused a slow-down in spending by our customers as they evaluate    the current and future economic impact of such crisis to their    project plans. If adverse economic and credit conditions persist    or worsen, we would likely experience decreased revenue from our    operations attributable to decreases in the spending levels of    our customers. Adverse economic and credit conditions might also    have a negative adverse effect on our cash flows if customers    demand that we accept smaller project deposits and less frequent    progress payments. In addition, adverse economic and credit    conditions could put downward pricing pressure on us. If any of    the foregoing occurs, there would be an adverse effect on our    results of operations.     Moreover, the state of the capital and credit markets could have    an adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional financing    on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, should we determine    such financing is desirable to expand our business. The    larger markets we serve are the petroleum refining and    petrochemical industries which are both cyclical in nature and    dependent on the price of oil. As a result, volatility in the    price of crude oil may negatively impact our operating    results.     Although we believe that the global consumption of crude oil    will increase over the course of the next twenty years and a    need to continually increase global oil refining capacity, the    price of crude oil has been very volatile. Many of our products    are purchased in connection with oil refinery construction,    revamps and upgrades. During times of significant volatility in    the market for crude oil, our customers may refrain from placing    orders until the market stabilizes. During such times of high    volatility, we could experience decreased revenue from our    operations attributable to decreases in the spending levels of    our customers. A    large percentage of our sales are in    non-U.S.    jurisdictions. As a result, we are subject to the economic,    political, regulatory and other risks of international    operations.     For fiscal 2010, approximately 55% of our revenue was from    customers located in countries outside of the U.S. We    believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside the    U.S. will continue to account for a significant portion of    our revenue for the foreseeable future. Moreover, we maintain a    subsidiary and have facilities in China. We believe that revenue    from the sale of our products outside the U.S. will    continue to account for a significant portion of our total    revenue for the foreseeable future. We intend to continue to    expand our international operations    5Table of Contents    to the extent that suitable opportunities become available. Our    foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a    result of:           nationalization of private enterprises and assets;           political or economic instability in certain countries,    especially during the ongoing global economic crisis;           differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in    protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement    of contract rights;           the possibility that foreign governments may adopt regulations    or take other actions that could directly or indirectly harm our    business and growth strategy;           credit risks;           currency fluctuations;           tariff and tax increases;           export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of    foreign governments;           shipping products during times of crisis or wars;           our failure to comply with U.S. laws regarding doing    business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act; and           other factors inherent in foreign operations. We are    subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely    affect our operating results.     We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the    U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we    sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on    U.S. dollars. As such, fluctuations in currency exchange    rates, which cause the value of the U.S. dollar to    increase, could have an adverse effect on the profitability of    our business. While we may enter into currency exchange rate    hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of    fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all    exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency    exchange rates. In addition, if the counter-parties to such    exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver    the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for    fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation. At    March 31, 2010, we held no forward foreign currency    exchange contracts. If we    fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to    keep abreast of technological changes in our markets, our    business and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     Although technologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are    well established, we believe our future success depends, in    part, on our ability to enhance our existing products and    develop new products in order to continue to meet customer    demands. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a    timely and cost-competitive basis, or the development of    processes that make our existing technologies or products    obsolete, could harm our business and results of operations. The    loss of any member of our management team and our inability to    make up for such loss with a qualified replacement could harm    our business.     Competition for qualified management in our industry is intense.    Many of the companies with which we compete for management    personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do    or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by    some to be more desirable places to live. If we are not able to    retain any of our key management personnel, our business could    be harmed.    6Table of ContentsOur    business is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully    implement our business strategy, we risk losing market share to    current and future competitors.     Some of our present and potential competitors may have    substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or    manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to    respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and    changes in customer demands. They may also be able to devote    greater resources towards the development, promotion and sale of    their products than we can. In addition, our current and    potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or    establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with    third parties that increase their ability to address the needs    of our customers. In addition, customer buying patterns can    change if customers become more price sensitive and accepting of    low cost suppliers. If we cannot compete successfully against    current or future competitors, our business will be harmed. If we    are unable to make necessary capital investments or respond to    pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.     In order to remain competitive, we need to invest continuously    in research and development, manufacturing, customer service and    support, and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust    the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not    have available sufficient financial or other resources to    continue to make investments necessary to maintain our    competitive position. If    third parties infringe upon our intellectual property or if we    were to infringe upon the intellectual property of third    parties, we may expend significant resources enforcing or    defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.     Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We    rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade    secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and    protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully    enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive    position could suffer. We may also be required to spend    significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual    property rights. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the    intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position    could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may develop    technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies,    duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around    our patents.     In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our    intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary    information, or to defend against claims by third parties that    our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any    litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or    without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and    divert the attention of our management, which could harm our    business and results of operations. In addition, any    intellectual property litigation or claims against us could    result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property    and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities,    require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us    from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to    redesign certain products, any of which could harm our business    and results of operations. We are    subject to contract cancellations and delays by our customers,    which may adversely affect our operating results.     Contract cancellations may occur, which could reduce the    realizable value of our backlog and negatively impact the amount    of revenue earned and the profitability of our business. Certain    contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for the    assessment of cancellation charges to our customers to    substantially compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled    contracts. Delay of contract execution by our customers can    result in volatility in our operating results. A    decrease in supply or increase in cost of the materials used in    our products could harm our profitability.     Any restrictions on the supply or the increase in the cost of    the materials used by us in manufacturing our products could    significantly reduce our profit margins, which could harm our    results of operations. Any efforts we may engage in to mitigate    restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by    entering into long-term    7Table of Contents    purchase agreements, by implementing productivity improvements    or by passing cost increases on to our customers may not be    successful. Our profitability depends largely on the price and    continuity of supply of the materials used in the manufacture of    our products, which in many instances are supplied by a limited    number of sources. If we    are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production    during times when we are experiencing strong demand, our results    of operations might be adversely affected. In addition,    outsourcing may negatively affect our profit    margins.     When we experience strong demand for our products, our business    strategy calls for us to increase manufacturing capacity through    outsourcing selected fabrication processes. We could experience    difficulty in outsourcing if customers demand that our products    be manufactured by us exclusively. Furthermore, our ability to    effectively outsource production could be adversely affected by    worldwide manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to    effectively outsource our production capacity when circumstances    warrant, our results of operations could be adversely affected    and we might not be able to deliver products to our customers on    a timely basis. In addition, outsourcing to complete our    products and services can increase the costs associated with    such products and services. If we rely too heavily on    outsourcing and are not able to increase our own production    capacity during times when there is high demand for our products    and services, our margins may be negatively effected. We    face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar    claims.     We are a defendant in several lawsuits alleging illnesses from    exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking    unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict    with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could    become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in    the future. In addition, because some of our products are used    in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any    failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could    result in litigation against us. Any litigation brought against    us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial    costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management,    which could harm our business and results of operations. If we    become subject to product liability claims, our results of    operations and financial condition could be adversely    affected.     The manufacturing and sale of our products exposes us to    potential product liability claims, including those that may    arise from failure to meet product specifications, misuse or    malfunction of, or design flaws in our products, or use of our    products with systems not manufactured or sold by us. For    example, our equipment is installed in facilities that operate    dangerous processes and the misapplication, improper    installation or failure of our equipment may result in exposure    to potentially hazardous substances, personal injury or property    damage.     Provisions contained in our contracts with customers which    attempt to limit our damages may not be enforceable in all    instances or may fail to protect us from liability for damages.    In addition, we carry liability insurance that we believe is    adequate to protect us from product liability claims, however,    our insurance may not cover all liabilities. We may not be able    to maintain this insurance at a reasonable cost or on reasonable    terms, or at all. Any material liability not covered by    provisions in our contracts or by insurance could have a    material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial    condition and cash flows. Risks    related to operating a subsidiary in China The    operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected    by Chinas evolving economic, political and social    conditions.     We conduct our business in China primarily through our    wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. The results of operations and    future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to    evolving economic, political and social developments in China.    In particular, the results of operations of our Chinese    subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things,    changes in Chinas political, economic and social    conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government,    changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of    existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange    regulations, measures that may be introduced to control    inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the    rates or methods of taxation.    8Table of ContentsIntellectual    property rights are difficult to enforce in China.     Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared with    the commercial law in many of our other major markets and    limited protection of intellectual property is available in    China as a practical matter. Although we take precautions in the    operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual    property, any local design or manufacture of products that we    undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that    unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or    use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We    may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter    patent or trademark infringers. Uncertainties    with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect    the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.     Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations    applicable to foreign investment in China. There are    uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of    laws, rules and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is    based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have    limited precedential value. Because many laws and regulations    are relatively new and the Chinese legal system is still    evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and    rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative    inexperience of Chinas judiciary in many cases creates    additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and    the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to    government policies reflecting domestic political changes.    Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on    existing law may be uncertain and sporadic. For the preceding    reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain swift and    equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect    companies like ours. Risks    related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions    contained in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our    stockholder rights plan could impair or delay stockholders    ability to change our management and could discourage takeover    transactions that our stockholders might consider to be in their    best interests.     Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as    well as our stockholder rights plan, could impede attempts by    our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could    discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover    or other change of control transaction, including a potential    transaction at a premium over the market price of our common    stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best    interests. For example:       We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms    adverse to our common stock.  Under our    certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is    authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine    the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without    obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common    stock. We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and    conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the    holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying    or preventing a change in control of our company.       We maintain a stockholder rights, or poison    pill, plan.  Our stockholder rights plan    has the effect of discouraging any person or group that wishes    to acquire 15% or more of our common stock from doing so without    obtaining our agreement because such acquisition would cause    such person or group to suffer substantial dilution. Such plan    may have the effect of discouraging a change in control    transaction that our stockholders would otherwise consider to be    in their best interests. This plan expires on September 11,    2010.       Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given    year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified    Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our    Board elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult    to effect a change of control because at least two annual    stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our    directors.       Our bylaws contain advance notice    requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that    any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual    meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for    election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders    must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the    meeting. Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of    making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder    meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.    9Table of Contents       Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority    voting to approve a change of control    transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our    outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any    merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our    assets and similar transactions if the other party to such    transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote. In    addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by    such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any    such transaction.       Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require    supermajority voting.  Our certificate of    incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment    require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding    shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to    vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our    shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended    to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.    This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to    our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might    otherwise consider to be in their best interests without    approval of our Board.       Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority    voting.  Although our Board of Directors is    permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may    only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of    our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the    shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or    more of our shares. This provision makes it more difficult for    our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be    in their best interests without approval of our Board. "
9,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2009-06-02,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks,    many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    If any of the events or risks described below occur or    materialize, our business and results of operations could be    seriously harmed. Risks    related to our business The    industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in    such industries may adversely affect our operating    results.     Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been    derived from the sale of our products to companies in the    chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating    industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for    these industries. The core industries in which our products are    used are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically    experienced severe downturns. Although we believe we are in a    long-term expansion    4Table of Contents    of demand for our products in the petrochemical, petroleum    refining and power generating industries, during fiscal 2009, we    entered a sudden downturn in the demand for our products and    services. Historically, previous cyclical downturns have lasted    from one to several years. We have no way to predict or control    the length or severity of this downturn. A sustained    deterioration in any of the cyclical industries we serve would    materially harm our business and operating results because our    customers would not likely have the resources necessary to    purchase our products nor would they likely have the need to    build additional facilities or improve existing facilities. We    serve markets that are capital intensive. The recent volatility    and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse    changes in the global economy may negatively impact our    operating results. Such volatility and disruption may also    negatively impact our ability to access additional    financing.     Although we believe that the fundamentals that have driven our    growth over the past few years remain essentially unchanged and    that our long-term growth prospects remain strong, we also    expect that the current economic crisis in the capital and    credit markets will cause a slow-down in spending by our    customers as they evaluate the current and future economic    impact of such crisis to their project plans. If adverse    economic and credit conditions persist or worsen, we would    likely experience decreased revenue from our operations    attributable to decreases in the spending levels of our    customers. Adverse economic and credit conditions might also    have a negative adverse effect on our cash flows if customers    demand that we accept smaller project deposits and less frequent    progress payments. In addition, adverse economic and credit    conditions could put downward pricing pressure on us. If any of    the foregoing occurs, there would be an adverse effect on our    results of operations.     Moreover, the current crises in the capital and credit markets    could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain additional    financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, should we    determine such financing is desirable to expand our business. The    larger markets we serve are the petroleum refining and    petrochemical industries which are both cyclical in nature and    dependent on the price of oil. As a result, volatility in the    price of crude oil may negatively impact our operating    results.     Although we believe that the global consumption of crude oil    will increase over the course of the next twenty years and that    there will be a shortage of global oil refining capacity, the    price of crude oil has been very volatile. Many of our products    are purchased in connection with oil refinery construction,    revamps and upgrades. During times of significant volatility in    the market for crude oil, our customers may refrain from placing    large orders until the market stabilizes. During such times of    high volatility, we could experience decreased revenue from our    operations attributable to decreases in the spending levels of    our customers. Our    international sales operations are subject to uncertainties that    could harm our business.     We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside    the United States will continue to account for a significant    portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. For    fiscal 2009, our sales to geographic regions were 63% domestic    and 37% international.     Our international sales operations are subject to numerous    risks, including:           difficulty enforcing agreements through some foreign legal    systems;           general economic and political conditions in the countries where    we sell our products may have an adverse effect on our sales in    those countries;           foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions    that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth    strategy; and           it may be difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in    some foreign countries.     Should any one of the above risks materialize, our business and    results of operations could be harmed.    5Table of ContentsA    large percentage of our sales are in    non-U.S.    jurisdictions. As a result, we are subject to the economic,    political, regulatory and other risks of international    operations.     For fiscal 2009, approximately 37% of our revenue was from    customers located in countries outside of the United States.    Moreover, we maintain a subsidiary and have facilities in China.    We intend to continue to expand our international operations to    the extent that suitable opportunities become available. Our    foreign operations and sales could be adversely affected as a    result of:           nationalization of private enterprises and assets;           political or economic instability in certain countries,    especially during the current global economic crisis;           differences in foreign laws, including increased difficulties in    protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement    of contract rights;           credit risks;           currency fluctuations;           tariff and tax increases;           export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of    foreign governments;           shipping products during times of crisis or wars;           our failure to comply with United States laws regarding doing    business in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Foreign Corrupt    Practices Act; and           other factors inherent in foreign operations. We are    subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely    affect our operating results.     We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the    U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we    sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on    U.S. dollars. As such, fluctuations in currency exchange    rates, which cause the value of the U.S. dollar to    increase, could have an adverse effect on the profitability of    our business. While we may enter into currency exchange rate    hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of    fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all    exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency    exchange rates. In addition, if the counter-parties to such    exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver    the contractual foreign currencies, we could be at risk for    fluctuations, if any, required to settle the obligation. At    March 31, 2009, we held no forward foreign currency    exchange contracts. If we    fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to    keep abreast of technological changes in our markets, our    business and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     Although technologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are    well established, we believe our future success depends, in    part, on our ability to enhance our existing products and    develop new products in order to continue to meet customer    demands. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a    timely and cost-competitive basis, or the development of    processes that make our existing technologies or products    obsolete, could harm our business and results of operations. The    loss of any member of our executive management team and our    inability to make up for such loss with a qualified replacement    could harm our business.     Competition for qualified management in our industry is intense.    Many of the companies with which we compete for management    personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do    or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by    some to be more desirable places to live. If we are not able to    retain qualified management personnel or if a significant number    of them were to leave our employ, our business could be harmed.    6Table of ContentsOur    business is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully    implement our business strategy, we risk losing market share to    current and future competitors.     Some of our present and potential competitors may have    substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or    manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to    respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and    changes in customer demands. They may also be able to devote    greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of    their products than we can. In addition, our current and    potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or    establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with    third parties that increase their ability to address the needs    of our customers. In addition, customer buying patterns can    change as they become more price sensitive and accepting of low    cost suppliers. If we cannot compete successfully against    current or future competitors, our business will be harmed. If we    are unable to make necessary capital investments or respond to    pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.     In order to remain competitive, we need to invest continuously    in research and development, manufacturing, customer service and    support, and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust    the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not    have available sufficient financial or other resources to    continue to make investments necessary to maintain our    competitive position. If    third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we were    to infringe the intellectual property of third parties, we may    expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights    or suffer competitive injury.     Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We    rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade    secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and    protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully    enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive    position could suffer. We may also be required to spend    significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual    property rights. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the    intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position    could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may develop    technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies,    duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around    our patents.     In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our    intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary    information, or to defend against claims by third parties that    our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any    litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or    without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and    divert the attention of our management, which could harm our    business and results of operations. In addition, any    intellectual property litigation or claims against us could    result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property    and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities,    require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us    from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to    redesign certain products, any of which could harm our business    and results of operations. We are    subject to contract cancellations and delays by our customers,    which may adversely affect our operating results.     Contract cancellations may occur, which could reduce the    realizable value of our backlog and negatively impact the amount    of revenue earned and the profitability of our business. Certain    contracts in backlog may contain provisions allowing for the    assessment of cancellation charges to our customers to    substantially compensate us for costs incurred on cancelled    contracts. Delay of contract execution by our customers can    result in volatility in our operating results. A    decrease in supply or increase in cost of the materials used in    our products could harm our profitability.     Any restrictions on the supply or the increase in the cost of    the materials used by us in manufacturing our products could    significantly reduce our profit margins, which could harm our    results of operations. Any efforts we may engage in to mitigate    restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by    entering into long-term    7Table of Contents    purchase agreements, by implementing productivity improvements    or by passing cost increases on to our customers may not be    successful. Our profitability depends largely on the price and    continuity of supply of the materials used in the manufacture of    our products, which in many instances are supplied by a limited    number of sources. If we    are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production    during times when we are experiencing strong demand, our results    of operations might be adversely affected. In addition,    outsourcing may negatively affect our profit    margins.     When we experience strong demand for our products, our business    strategy calls for us to increase manufacturing capacity through    outsourcing selected fabrication processes. We could experience    difficulty in outsourcing if customers demand that our products    be manufactured by us exclusively. Furthermore, our ability to    effectively outsource production could be adversely affected by    limited worldwide manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to    effectively outsource our production capacity when circumstances    warrant, our results of operations could be adversely affected    and we might not be able to deliver products to our customers on    a timely basis. In addition, outsourcing to complete our    products and services can increase the costs associated with    such products and services. If we rely too heavily on    outsourcing and are not able to increase our own production    capacity during times when there is high demand for our products    and services, our margins may be negatively effected. We    face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar    claims.     We are a defendant in several lawsuits alleging illnesses from    exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking    unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict    with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could    become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in    the future. In addition, because some of our products are used    in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any    failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could    result in litigation against us. Any litigation brought against    us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial    costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management,    which could harm our business and results of operations. Risks    related to operating a subsidiary in China The    operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected    by Chinas evolving economic, political and social    conditions.     We conduct our business in China primarily through our    wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. The results of operations and    future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to    evolving economic, political and social developments in China.    In particular, the results of operations of our Chinese    subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things,    changes in Chinas political, economic and social    conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government,    changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of    existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange    regulations, measures that may be introduced to control    inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the    rates or methods of taxation. Intellectual    property rights are difficult to enforce in China.     Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the    commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited    protection of intellectual property is available in China as a    practical matter. Although we intend to take precautions in the    operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual    property, any local design or manufacture of products that we    undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that    unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or    use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We    may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter    patent or trademark infringers. Uncertainties    with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect    the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.     Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations    applicable to foreign investment in China. There are    uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of    laws, rules and policies in China. The Chinese legal system is    based on written statutes, and prior court decisions have    limited precedential value. Because many laws    8Table of Contents    and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal system    is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws, regulations    and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the relative    inexperience of Chinas judiciary in many cases creates    additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation, and    the interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to    government policies reflecting domestic political changes.    Finally, enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on    existing law may be uncertain and sporadic. For the preceding    reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain swift and    equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to protect    companies like ours. Risks    related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions    contained in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our    stockholder rights plan could impair or delay stockholders    ability to change our management and could discourage takeover    transactions that our stockholders might consider to be in their    best interests.     Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as    well as our stockholder rights plan, could impede attempts by    our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could    discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover    or other change of control transaction, including a potential    transaction at a premium over the market price of our common    stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best    interests. For example:       We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms    adverse to our common stock.  Under our    certificate of incorporation, our Board of Directors is    authorized to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine    the rights, preferences and privileges of such shares without    obtaining any further approval from the holders of our common    stock. We could issue shares of preferred stock with voting and    conversion rights that adversely affect the voting power of the    holders of our common stock, or that have the effect of delaying    or preventing a change in control of our company.       We maintain a stockholder rights, or poison    pill, plan.  Our stockholder rights plan    has the effect of discouraging any person or group that wishes    to acquire 15% or more of our common stock from doing so without    obtaining our agreement because such acquisition would cause    such person or group to suffer substantial dilution. Such plan    may have the effect of discouraging a change in control    transaction that our stockholders would otherwise consider to be    in their best interests.       Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given    year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified    Board of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our    Board elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult    to effect a change of control because at least two annual    stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our    directors.       Our bylaws contain advance notice    requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that    any stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual    meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for    election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders    must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the    meeting. Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of    making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder    meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.       Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority    voting to approve a change of control    transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our    outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any    merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our    assets and similar transactions if the other party to such    transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote. In    addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by    such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any    such transaction.       Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require    supermajority voting.  Our certificate of    incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment    require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding    shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to    vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our    shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended    to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.    This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to    our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might    otherwise consider to be in their best interests without    approval of our Board.    9Table of Contents       Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority    voting.  Although our Board of Directors is    permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may    only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of    our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the    shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or    more of our shares. This provision makes it more difficult for    our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be    in their best interests without approval of our Board. "
17,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2008-06-03,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks,    many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    If any of the events or risks described below occur or    materialize, our business and results of operations could be    seriously harmed. Risks    related to our business The    industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in    such industries may adversely affect our operating    results.     Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been    derived from the sale of our products to companies in the    chemical, petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating    industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for    these industries. The core industries in which our products are    used are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically    experienced severe downturns. Although we are currently in an    upturn of demand for our products in the petrochemical,    petroleum refining and power generating industries, a downturn    in one or more of these industries could occur at any time. A    deterioration in any of the cyclical industries we serve would    harm our business and operating results because our customers    would not likely have the resources necessary to purchase our    products nor would they likely have the need to build additional    facilities or improve existing facilities. Our    international sales operations are subject to uncertainties that    could harm our business.     We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside    the United States will continue to account for a significant    portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. For    fiscal 2008, our sales to geographic regions were as follows:    54%  United States; 15%  Asia;    11%  Middle East; 10%  Mexico and South    America;    5Table of Contents    7%  Canada; and 3%  various other regions.    Our international sales operations are subject to numerous    risks, including:           difficulty enforcing agreements through some foreign legal    systems;           general economic and political conditions in the countries where    we sell our products may have an adverse effect on our sales in    those countries;           foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions    that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth    strategy; and           it may be difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in    some foreign countries.     The occurrence of any one of the above risks could harm our    business and results of operations. We are    subject to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely    affect our operating results.     We are exposed to the risk of currency fluctuations between the    U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we    sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on    U.S. dollars. As such, fluctuations in currency exchange    rates, which cause the value of the U.S. dollar to    increase, could have an adverse effect on the profitability of    our business. While we may enter into currency exchange rate    hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of    fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all    exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency    exchange rates. At March 31, 2008 and 2007, we held no    forward foreign currency exchange contracts. If we    fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to    keep abreast of technological changes in our markets, our    business and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     Although technologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are    well established, we believe our future success depends in part    on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new    products in order to continue to meet customer demands. Our    failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and    cost-competitive basis, or the development of processes that    make our existing technologies or products obsolete, could harm    our business and results of operations. The    loss of any key management personnel and our inability to    replace them with qualified management personnel could harm our    business.     Competition for qualified management in our industry is intense.    Many of the companies with which we compete for management    personnel have greater financial and other resources than we do    or are located in geographic areas which may be considered by    some to be more desirable places to live. If we are not able to    retain qualified management personnel or if a significant number    of them were to leave our employ, our business could be harmed.    We maintain key person insurance on our President and Chief    Executive Officer. Our    business is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully    implement our business strategy, we risk losing market share to    current and future competitors.     Some of our present and potential competitors may have    substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or    manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to    respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and    changes in customer demands. They may also be able to devote    greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of    their products than we can. In addition, our current and    potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or    establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with    third parties that increase their ability to address the needs    of our customers. If we cannot compete successfully against    current or future competitors, our business will be harmed.    6Table of ContentsIf we    are unable to make necessary capital investments or respond to    pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.     In order to remain competitive, we need to invest continuously    in research and development, manufacturing, customer service and    support, and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust    the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not    have available sufficient financial or other resources to    continue to make investments necessary to maintain our    competitive position. If    third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we were    to infringe the intellectual property of third parties, we may    expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights    or suffer competitive injury.     Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We    rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade    secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and    protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully    enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive    position could suffer. We may also be required to spend    significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual    property rights. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the    intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position    could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may develop    technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies,    duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around    our patents.     In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our    intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary    information, or to defend against claims by third parties that    our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any    litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or    without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and    divert the attention of our management, which could harm our    business and results of operations. In addition, any    intellectual property litigation or claims against us could    result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property    and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities,    require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us    from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to    redesign certain products, any of which could harm our business    and results of operations. A    decrease in supply or increase in cost of the materials used in    our products could harm our profitability.     Any restrictions on the supply or the increase in the cost of    the materials used by us in manufacturing our products could    significantly reduce our profit margins which could harm our    results of operations. Any efforts we may engage in to mitigate    restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by    entering into long-term purchase agreements, by implementing    productivity improvements or by passing cost increases on to our    customers may not be successful. Our profitability depends    largely on the price and continuity of supply of the materials    used in the manufacture of our products, which in many instances    are supplied by a limited number of sources. If we    are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production    during times when we are experiencing strong demand, our results    of operations might be adversely affected. In addition,    outsourcing may negatively affect our profit    margins.     When we experience strong demand for our products, our business    strategy calls for us to increase manufacturing capacity through    outsourcing selected fabrication processes. We could experience    difficulty in outsourcing if customers demand that our products    be manufactured by us exclusively. Furthermore, our ability to    effectively outsource production could be adversely affected by    limited worldwide manufacturing capacity. If we are unable to    effectively outsource our production capacity when circumstances    warrant, our results of operations could be adversely affected    and we might not be able to deliver products to our customers on    a timely basis. In addition, outsourcing to complete our    products and services can increase the costs associated with    such products and services. If we rely too heavily on    outsourcing and are not able to increase our own production    capacity during times when there is high demand for our products    and services, our margins may be negatively effected.    7Table of ContentsWe    face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar    claims.     We are a defendant in several lawsuits alleging illnesses from    exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking    unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict    with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could    become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in    the future. In addition, because some of our products are used    in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any    failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could    result in litigation against us. Any litigation brought against    us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial    costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management,    which could harm our business and results of operations. Risks    related to operating a subsidiary in China The    operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected    by Chinas evolving economic, political and social    conditions.     We conduct our business in China primarily through our    wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. The results of operations and    future prospects of our Chinese subsidiary are subject to    evolving economic, political and social developments in China.    In particular, the results of operations of our Chinese    subsidiary may be adversely affected by, among other things,    changes in Chinas political, economic and social    conditions, changes in policies of the Chinese government,    changes in laws and regulations or in the interpretation of    existing laws and regulations, changes in foreign exchange    regulations, measures that may be introduced to control    inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes in the    rates or methods of taxation. Intellectual    property rights are difficult to enforce in China.     Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the    commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited    protection of intellectual property is available in China as a    practical matter.

We    may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter    patent or trademark infringers. Uncertainties    with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect    the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.     Our Chinese subsidiary is subject to laws and regulations    applicable to foreign investment in China.

Although we are currently in an    upturn of demand for our products in the petrochemical,    petroleum refining and power generating industries, a downturn    in one or more of these industries could occur at any time. In    the event of such a downturn, we have no way of knowing if, when    and to what extent there might be a recovery. A deterioration in    any of the cyclical industries we serve would harm our business    and operating results because our customers would not likely    have the resources necessary to purchase our products nor would    they likely have the need to build additional facilities or    improve existing facilities. Our    international sales operations are subject to uncertainties that    could harm our business.     We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside    the United States will continue to account for a material    portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. For    fiscal 2007, our sales to geographic regions were as follows:    50%  United States; 23%  Middle East;    17%  Asia; 4%  Canada; 2%     Mexico and South America; and 4%  various other    regions. Our international sales operations are subject to    numerous risks, including:           it may be difficult to enforce agreements and collect    receivables through some foreign legal systems;           foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers    in the United States;           tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the    United States and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding    requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or    other restrictions;           general economic and political conditions in the countries where    we sell our products may have an adverse effect on our sales in    those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy;           foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions    that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth    strategy; and           it may be difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in    some foreign countries.     The occurrence of any one of the above risks could harm our    business and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed    to the risk of currency fluctuations between the    U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we    sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on    U.S. dollars, as we compete for orders against foreign    competitors that base their prices on relatively weaker    currencies. As such, fluctuations in currency exchange rates,    which cause the value of the U.S. dollar to increase, could    have an adverse effect on the profitability of our business.    While we may enter into currency exchange rate hedges from time    to time to mitigate these types of fluctuations, we cannot    remove all fluctuations or hedge all exposures and our earnings    are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates. At    March 31, 2007 and 2006, we held no forward foreign    currency exchange contracts. If we    fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to    keep abreast of technological changes in our markets, our    business and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     Although technologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are    well established, we believe our future success depends in part    on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new    products in order to continue to meet customer demands. Our    failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and    cost-competitive basis, or the development of processes that    make our existing technologies or products obsolete, could harm    our business and results of operations.    5Table of ContentsThe    loss of any of our senior executive officers or our inability to    hire additional qualified management personnel could harm our    business.     We are dependent to a large degree on the services of James R.    Lines, our president and chief operating officer and J. Ronald    Hansen, our vice president of finance and administration and    chief financial officer. Our operations may suffer if we were to    lose the services of either of our senior executive officers. We    maintain key person insurance only on Mr. Lines.     In addition, competition for qualified management in our    industry is intense. Many of the companies with which we compete    for management personnel have greater financial and other    resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which    may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.    If we are not able to retain qualified management personnel or    if a significant number of them were to leave our employ, our    business could be harmed. Our    business is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully    implement our business strategy, we risk losing market share to    current and future competitors.     Some of our present and potential competitors have or may have    substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or    manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to    respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and    changes in customer demands. They may also be able to devote    greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of    their products than we can. In addition, our current and    potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or    establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with    third parties that increase their ability to address the needs    of our existing customers. If we cannot compete successfully    against current or future competitors, our business will be    harmed. If we    are unable to make necessary capital investments or respond to    pricing pressures, our business may be harmed.     In order to remain competitive, we need to invest continuously    in research and development, manufacturing, customer service and    support, and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust    the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not    have available sufficient financial or other resources to    continue to make investments necessary to maintain our    competitive position. If    third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we were    to infringe the intellectual property of third parties, we may    expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights    or suffer competitive injury.     Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We    rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade    secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and    protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully    enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive    position could suffer. We may also be required to spend    significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual    property rights. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the    intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position    could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may develop    technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies,    duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around    our patents.     In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our    intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary    information, or to defend against claims by third parties that    our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any    litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or    without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and    divert the attention of our management, which could harm our    business and results of operations. In addition, any    intellectual property litigation or claims against us could    result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property    and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities,    require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us    from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to    redesign certain products, any of which could harm our business    and results of operations.    6Table of ContentsA    decrease in supply or increase in cost of the materials used in    our products could harm our profitability.     Any restrictions on the supply or the increase in the cost of    the materials used by us in manufacturing our products could    significantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate    restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by    entering into long-term purchase agreements, by implementing    productivity improvements or by passing cost increases on to our    customers may not be successful. Our profitability depends    largely on the price and continuity of supply of the materials    used in the manufacture of our products, which in many instances    are supplied by a limited number of sources. If we    are unable to effectively outsource a portion of our production    during times when we are experiencing strong demand, our results    of operations might be adversely affected. In addition,    outsourcing may negatively affect our profit    margins.     Part of our business strategy calls for us to increase    manufacturing capacity through outsourcing selected fabrication    when we are experiencing strong demand for our products. We    could experience difficulty in outsourcing if customers demand    that our products be manufactured by us exclusively.    Furthermore, our ability to effectively outsource production    could be adversely affected by limited worldwide manufacturing    capacity. If we are unable to effectively outsource our    production capacity when circumstances warrant, our results of    operations could be adversely affected and we might not be able    to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. In    addition, outsourcing to complete our products and services can    increase the costs associated with such products and services.    If we rely too heavily on outsourcing and are not able to    increase our own production capacity during times when there is    high demand for our products and services, our gross margins may    be negatively effected. We    face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar    claims.     We are a defendant in several lawsuits alleging illnesses from    exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking    unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict    with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could    become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in    the future. In addition, because some of our products are used    in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any    failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could    result in litigation against us. Any litigation brought against    us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial    costs to us as well as divert the attention of our management,    which could harm our business and results of operations. Risks    related to operating a subsidiary in China The    operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected    by Chinas evolving economic, political and social    conditions.     The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese    subsidiary are subject to evolving economic, political and    social developments in China. In particular, the results of    operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected    by, among other things, changes in Chinas political,    economic and social conditions, changes in policies of the    Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the    interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in    foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to    control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes    in the rates or methods of taxation. It may    be difficult for our Chinese subsidiary to make dividend or    other payments to us, which could adversely affect our results    of operations.     Our ability to receive dividends and payments from, and transfer    funds to, our Chinese subsidiary could be subject to    restrictions under Chinese laws. Any such restrictions could    negatively affect our results of operations and restrict our    ability to act quickly in response to changing market conditions.    7Table of ContentsIntellectual    property rights are difficult to enforce in China.     Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the    commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited    protection of intellectual property is available in China as a    practical matter. Although we intend to take precautions in the    operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual    property, any local design or manufacture of products that we    undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that    unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or    use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We    may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter    patent or trademark infringers. Uncertainties    with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect    the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.     We conduct our business in China primarily through our    wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. Our Chinese subsidiary is    subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment    in China. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation    and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China. The    Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior    court decisions have limited precedential value. Because many    laws and regulations are relatively new and the Chinese legal    system is still evolving, the interpretations of many laws,    regulations and rules are not always uniform. Moreover, the    relative inexperience of Chinas judiciary in many cases    creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any    litigation, and the interpretation of statutes and regulations    may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic    political changes. Finally, enforcement of existing laws or    contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.    For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain    swift and equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to    protect companies like ours. Risks    related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions    contained in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our    stockholder rights plan could impair or delay stockholders    ability to change our management and could discourage takeover    transactions that our stockholders might consider to be in their    best interests.     Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as    well as our stockholder rights plan, could impede attempts by    our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could    discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover    or other change of control transaction, including a potential    transaction at a premium over the market price of our common    stock, that our stockholders might consider to be in their best    interests. For example:       We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse    to our common stock.  Under our certificate of    incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue    shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights,    preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any    further approval from the holders of our common stock. Up to    440,000 of such undesignated shares of preferred stock are    presently eligible for issuance. We could issue shares of    preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely    affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or    that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in    control of our company.       We maintain a stockholder rights, or poison pill,    plan.  Our stockholder rights plan has the effect    of discouraging any person or group that wishes to acquire 15%    or more of our common stock from doing so without obtaining our    agreement because such acquisition would cause such person or    group to suffer substantial dilution. Such plan may have the    effect of discouraging a change in control transaction that our    stockholders would otherwise consider to be in their best    interests.       Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given    year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified Board    of Directors, with only approximately one-third of our Board    elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult to    effect a change of control because at least two annual    stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our    directors.       Our bylaws contain advance notice    requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any    stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual    meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for    election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders    must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us    8Table of Contents     before the meeting. Such advance notice provisions may have the    effect of making it more difficult to introduce business at    stockholder meetings or nominate candidates for election as    director.       Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority    voting to approve a change of control    transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our    outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any    merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our    assets and similar transactions if the other party to such    transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote. In    addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by    such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any    such transaction.       Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require    supermajority voting.  Our certificate of    incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment    require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding    shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to    vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our    shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended    to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our Board.    This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to    our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might    otherwise consider to be in their best interests without    approval of our Board.       Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority    voting.  Although our Board of Directors is    permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may    only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of    our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the    shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or    more of our shares. This provision makes it more difficult for    our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be    in their best interests without approval of our Board. Our    stock price may be volatile because of factors beyond our    control.     The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly    in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our    control, including:           variations in our revenue and operating results from quarter to    quarter;           developments or downturns in the industries in which we do    business;           our ability to obtain    and/or    maintain securities analyst coverage;           changes in securities analysts recommendations or    estimates of our financial performance;           changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours;           announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, new    offerings, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint    ventures or capital commitments; and           general economic conditions.     In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the    market price of their stock have been subject to securities    class action litigation. A securities class action lawsuit    against us, regardless of its merit, could result in substantial    costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which in    turn could harm our business and results of operations. "
14,GHM,GRAHAM CORP,2006-06-08,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Our business and operations are subject to numerous risks,    many of which are described below and elsewhere in this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K.    If any of the events described below occur, our business and    results of operations could be harmed. Risks    related to our business The    industries in which we operate are cyclical, and downturns in    such industries may adversely affect our operating    results.     Historically, a substantial portion of our revenue has been    derived from sales of our products to companies in the chemical,    petrochemical, petroleum refining and power generating    industries, or to firms that design and construct facilities for    these industries. The core industries in which our products are    used are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically    experienced severe downturns. Although we are currently in an    upturn of demand for our products in the petrochemical,    petroleum refining and power generating industries, a downturn    in one or more of these industries could occur at any time. In    the event of such a downturn, we have no way of knowing if, when    and to what extent there might be a recovery. A deterioration in    any of the cyclical industries we serve would harm our    4Table of Contents    business and operating results because our customers would not    likely have the resources necessary to purchase our products nor    would they likely have the need to build additional facilities    or improve existing facilities. Our    international sales operations are subject to uncertainties that    could harm our business.     We believe that revenue from the sale of our products outside    the United States will continue to account for a material    portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. For    fiscal 2006, our sales to geographic regions were as follows:    51%  United States; 16%  Asia;    9%  Canada; 8%  Mexico and South    America; 14%  Middle East; and    2%  various other regions. No sales to the    Middle East were to terrorist sponsoring nations. Our    international sales operations are subject to numerous risks,    including:           it may be difficult to enforce agreements and collect    receivables through some foreign legal systems;           foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers    in the United States;           tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the    United States and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding    requirements or the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or    other restrictions;           general economic and political conditions in the countries where    we sell our products may have an adverse effect on our sales in    those countries or not be favorable to our growth strategy;           foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions    that could directly or indirectly harm our business and growth    strategy; and           it may be difficult to enforce intellectual property rights in    some foreign countries.     The occurrence of any one of the above risks could harm our    business and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed    to the risk of currency fluctuations between the    U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which we    sell our products to the extent that such sales are not based on    U.S. dollars. As such, fluctuations in currency exchange    rates, which cause the value of the U.S. dollar to    increase, could have an adverse effect on the profitability of    our business. While we may enter into currency exchange rate    hedges from time to time to mitigate these types of    fluctuations, we cannot remove all fluctuations or hedge all    exposures and our earnings are impacted by changes in currency    exchange rates. At March 31, 2006 and 2005, we held no    forward foreign currency exchange contracts. If we    fail to introduce enhancements to our existing products or to    keep abreast of technological changes in our markets, our    business and results of operations could be adversely    effected.     Although technologies in the vacuum and heat transfer areas are    well established, we believe our future success depends in part    on our ability to enhance our existing products and develop new    products in order to continue to meet customer demands. Our    failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and    cost-competitive basis, or the development of processes that    make our existing technologies or products obsolete, could harm    our business and results of operations. The    loss of any of our senior executive officers or our inability to    hire additional qualified management personnel could harm our    business.     We are dependent to a large degree on the services of William C.    Johnson, our president and chief executive officer, J. Ronald    Hansen, our vice president of finance and administration and    chief financial officer, James R. Lines, our vice president and    general manager, and Stephen P. Northrup, our vice president of    Asia operations. Our operations may suffer if we were to lose    the services of any of our senior executive officers. With the    exception of Mr. Lines, we do not maintain key person    insurance on any of our senior executive officers.     In addition, competition for qualified management in our    industry is intense. Many of the companies with which we compete    for management personnel have greater financial and other    resources than we do or are located in geographic areas which    may be considered by some to be more desirable places to live.    If we are not able to retain qualified management personnel or    if a significant number of them were to leave our employ, our    business could be harmed.    5Table of ContentsOur    business is highly competitive. If we are unable to successfully    implement our business strategy, we risk losing market share to    current and future competitors.     Some of our present and potential competitors have or may have    substantially greater financial, marketing, technical or    manufacturing resources. Our competitors may also be able to    respond more quickly to new technologies or processes and    changes in customer demands. They may also be able to devote    greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of    their products than we can. In addition, our current and    potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or    establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with    third parties that increase their ability to address the needs    of our existing customers. If we cannot compete successfully    against current or future competitors, our business will be    harmed. If we    are unable to make necessary capital investments, our business    may be harmed.     In order to remain competitive, we need to invest continuously    in research and development, manufacturing, customer service and    support, and marketing. From time to time we also have to adjust    the prices of our products to remain competitive. We may not    have available sufficient financial or other resources to    continue to make investments necessary to maintain our    competitive position. If    third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we were    to infringe the intellectual property of third parties, we may    expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights    or suffer competitive injury.     Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology. We    rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade    secret laws and confidentiality provisions to establish and    protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully    enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive    position could suffer. We may also be required to spend    significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual    property rights. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the    intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position    could suffer. Furthermore, other companies may develop    technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies,    duplicate or reverse engineer our technologies or design around    our patents.     In some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our    intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary    information, or to defend against claims by third parties that    our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any    litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or    without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and    divert the attention of our management, which could harm our    business and results of operations. In addition, any    intellectual property litigation or claims against us could    result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property    and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities,    require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us    from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to    redesign certain products, any of which could harm our business    and results of operations. A    decrease in supply or increase in cost of the materials used in    our products could harm our profitability.     Any restrictions on the supply or the increase in the cost of    the materials used by us in manufacturing our products could    significantly reduce our profit margins. Efforts to mitigate    restrictions on the supply or price increases of materials by    entering into long-term purchase agreements, by implementing    productivity improvements or by passing cost increases on to our    customers may not be successful. Our profitability depends    largely on the price and continuity of supply of the materials    used in the manufacture of our products, which in many instances    are supplied by a limited number of sources. We    face potential liability from asbestos exposure and similar    claims.     We are a defendant in several lawsuits alleging illnesses from    exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products and seeking    unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. We cannot predict    with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits or whether we could    become subject to any similar, related or additional lawsuits in    the future. In addition, because some of our products are used    in systems that handle toxic or hazardous substances, any    failure or alleged failure of our products in the future could    result in litigation against us. Any litigation brought    6Table of Contents    against us, whether with or without merit, could result in    substantial costs to us as well as divert the attention of our    management, which could harm our business and results of    operations. Risks    related to operating a subsidiary in China The    operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected    by Chinas evolving economic, political and social    conditions.     The results of operations and future prospects of our Chinese    subsidiary are subject to evolving economic, political and    social developments in China. In particular, the results of    operations of our Chinese subsidiary may be adversely affected    by, among other things, changes in Chinas political,    economic and social conditions, changes in policies of the    Chinese government, changes in laws and regulations or in the    interpretation of existing laws and regulations, changes in    foreign exchange regulations, measures that may be introduced to    control inflation, such as interest rate increases, and changes    in the rates or methods of taxation. It may    be difficult for our Chinese subsidiary to make dividend or    other payments to us, which could adversely effect our results    of operations.     Our ability to receive dividends and payments from, and transfer    funds to, our Chinese subsidiary could be subject to    restrictions under Chinese laws. Any such restrictions could    negatively affect our results of operations and restrict our    ability to act quickly in response to changing market conditions. Intellectual    property rights are difficult to enforce in China.     Chinese commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the    commercial law in many of our other major markets and limited    protection of intellectual property is available in China as a    practical matter. Although we intend to take precautions in the    operations of our Chinese subsidiary to protect our intellectual    property, any local design or manufacture of products that we    undertake in China could subject us to an increased risk that    unauthorized parties will be able to copy or otherwise obtain or    use our intellectual property, which could harm our business. We    may also have limited legal recourse in the event we encounter    patent or trademark infringers. Uncertainties    with respect to the Chinese legal system may adversely affect    the operations of our Chinese subsidiary.     We conduct our business in China primarily through our    wholly-owned Chinese subsidiary. Our Chinese subsidiary is    subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment    in China. There are uncertainties regarding the interpretation    and enforcement of laws, rules and policies in China. The    Chinese legal system is based on written statutes, and prior    court decisions have limited precedential value.

Finally, enforcement of existing laws or    contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic.    For the preceding reasons, it may be difficult for us to obtain    swift and equitable enforcement of laws ostensibly designed to    protect companies like ours. Risks    related to the ownership of our common stock Provisions    contained in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and our    stockholder rights plan could impair or delay stockholders    ability to change our management and could discourage takeover    transactions that our stockholders might consider to be in their    best interests.     Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as    well as our stockholder rights plan, could impede attempts by    our stockholders to remove or replace our management and could    discourage others from initiating a potential merger, takeover    or other change of control transaction, including a potential    transaction at a premium    7Table of Contents    over the market price of our common stock, that our stockholders    might consider to be in their best interests. For example:       We could issue shares of preferred stock with terms adverse    to our common stock.  Under our certificate of    incorporation, our board of directors is authorized to issue    shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights,    preferences and privileges of such shares without obtaining any    further approval from the holders of our common stock. Up to    440,000 of such undesignated shares of preferred stock are    presently eligible for issuance. We could issue shares of    preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that adversely    affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, or    that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in    control of our company.       We maintain a stockholder rights, or poison pill,    plan.  Our stockholder rights plan has the effect    of discouraging any person or group that wishes to acquire 15%    or more of our common stock from doing so without obtaining our    agreement because such acquisition would cause such person or    group to suffer substantial dilution. Such plan may have the    effect of discouraging a change in control transaction that our    stockholders would otherwise consider to be in their best    interests.       Only a minority of our directors may be elected in a given    year.  Our bylaws provide for a classified board    of directors, with only approximately one-third of our board    elected each year. This provision makes it more difficult to    effect a change of control because at least two annual    stockholder meetings are necessary to replace a majority of our    directors.       Our bylaws contain advance notice    requirements.  Our bylaws also provide that any    stockholder who wishes to bring business before an annual    meeting of our stockholders or to nominate candidates for    election as directors at an annual meeting of our stockholders    must deliver advance notice of their proposals to us before the    meeting. Such advance notice provisions may have the effect of    making it more difficult to introduce business at stockholder    meetings or nominate candidates for election as director.       Our certificate of incorporation requires supermajority    voting to approve a change of control    transaction.  Seventy-five percent of our    outstanding shares entitled to vote are required to approve any    merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our    assets and similar transactions if the other party to such    transaction owns 5% or more of our shares entitled to vote. In    addition, a majority of the shares entitled to vote not owned by    such 5% or greater stockholder are also required to approve any    such transaction.       Amendments to our certificate of incorporation require    supermajority voting.  Our certificate of    incorporation contains provisions that make its amendment    require the affirmative vote of both 75% of our outstanding    shares entitled to vote and a majority of the shares entitled to    vote not owned by any person who may hold 50% or more of our    shares unless the proposed amendment was previously recommended    to our stockholders by an affirmative vote of 75% of our board.    This provision makes it more difficult to implement a change to    our certificate of incorporation that stockholders might    otherwise consider to be in their best interests without    approval of our board.       Amendments to our bylaws require supermajority    voting.  Although our board of directors is    permitted to amend our bylaws at any time, our stockholders may    only amend our bylaws upon the affirmative vote of both 75% of    our outstanding shares entitled to vote and a majority of the    shares entitled to vote not owned by any person who owns 50% or    more of our shares. This provision makes it more difficult for    our stockholders to implement a change they may consider to be    in their best interests without approval of our board. Our    stock price may be volatile because of factors beyond our    control.     The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly    in response to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our    control, including:           variations in our revenue and operating results from quarter to    quarter;           developments or downturns in the industries in which we do    business;           our ability to obtain    and/or    maintain securities analyst coverage;    8Table of Contents           changes in securities analysts recommendations or    estimates of our financial performance;           changes in market valuations of companies similar to ours;           announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, new    offerings, acquisitions, commercial relationships, joint    ventures or capital commitments; and           general economic conditions.     In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the    market price of their stock have been subject to securities    class action litigation. A securities class action lawsuit    against us, regardless of its merit, could result in substantial    costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which in    turn could harm our business and results of operations. "
