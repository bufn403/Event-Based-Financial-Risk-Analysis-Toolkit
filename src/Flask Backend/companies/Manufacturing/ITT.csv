Downturns in these industries could adversely affect our  businesses.- - Many of our government contracts are subject to profit limitations, which  limit our upside potential on a per contract basis, and all are subject to  termination by our customers, Termination of key government contracts or a  significant number of government contracts would have a negative impact on our  businesses.- - Competition pressures in all our businesses include product capability,  technological innovation, cycle time, price pressures, quality and the  reliability of services we offer.
