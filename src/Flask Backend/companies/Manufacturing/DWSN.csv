1,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2024-04-01,">Item 1A.  RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed below. You should carefully consider these discussions of risk and the other information included in this Form 10-K. These risk factors could affect our actual results and should be considered carefully when evaluating us and an investment in our common stock. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Current macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures in the broader U.S. economy and military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East have had, and are expected to continue to have, an impact on oil and gas commodity prices and, therefore, demand for our services and, depending on the duration and severity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. We are monitoring the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the related export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others. We are also monitoring the impact of attacks on shipping in the Red Sea as a result of the unrest in the Middle East. The broader consequences of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and unrest in the Middle East, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, supply chain disruptions, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, may have adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions, increase volatility in the price and 6Table of Contentsdemand for oil and natural gas, increase exposure to cyberattacks, cause disruptions in global supply chains, increase foreign currency fluctuations, cause constraints or disruption in the capital markets and limit sources of liquidity. We cannot predict the extent of the conflict’s effect on our business and results of operations as well as on the global economy and energy markets.Additional factors which may affect oil and natural gas prices include, but are not limited to, the effect of U.S. energy, monetary and trade policies; U.S. and global economic and political conditions and developments; U.S. and international energy and environmental policies; and any operating curtailment of the U.S. oil and gas industry. Together, these factors have created uncertainty for the demand and pricing for services, equipment, and raw materials in the petroleum industry, and may continue to do so in the future. We derive substantially all of our revenues from providers of multi-client data libraries and companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry. The oil and natural gas industry is a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend primarily on oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital allocation by our clients. Significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected, and will continue to affect, demand for our services and our results of operations. We could be adversely impacted if the level of such exploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to significantly decline in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting:●our revenues, cash flows, and profitability;●our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;●our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and●our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services.Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services, or may become unable to pay, or have to delay payment of, amounts owed to us for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including:●the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;●the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;●the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;●available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;●the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing;●actions by OPEC+;●political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;●economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;7Table of Contents●domestic and foreign tax policy;●domestic and foreign energy policy including increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy;●increased attention to environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change;●weather conditions in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere;●the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;●the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and●the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas.We are a ""controlled company"", which exempts us from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.As of December 31, 2023, Wilks Brothers, LLC (“Wilks”) and its affiliates control over 80% of our combined voting power and can elect all of the members of our board of directors. As a result, we are considered a “controlled company” for the purposes of the Nasdaq listing requirements. As a “controlled company,” we are permitted to, and we may, opt out of the Nasdaq listing requirements that would require (i) a majority of the members of our board of directors to be independent, (ii) that we establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent directors, or (iii) an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. The Nasdaq listing requirements are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. Our shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. It is also possible that the interests of Wilks may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of the holders of our common stock. A limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a relatively small number of oil and gas exploration and development companies and providers of multi-client data libraries. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, our four largest clients accounted for approximately 73% of our revenues. If these clients, or any of our other significant clients, were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties or for any other reason, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues.Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. If the oil and natural gas industry experiences a downturn, it may result in an increase in delays, reductions or cancellations by our clients. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding period. Our revenues, operating results and cash flows can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased client demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other 8Table of Contentsfactors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season, and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity during the second and third quarters of each year. The demand for our services would be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, cash flows, EBITDA, margin, and profitability from quarter-to-quarter, rendering quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance. Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability.We extend credit to our clients without requiring collateral, and a default by a client could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients’ financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our clients. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and could reduce the client’s future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients may also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period involved.We have historically incurred net losses.We incurred net losses of $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.The high fixed costs of our operations could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs, consisting primarily of depreciation (a non-cash expense) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in continuing or increasing operating losses. We have indebtedness from time to time under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our accounts receivable and a restricted IntraFi Network Deposit account are pledged as collateral for these obligations. Our ability to borrow may be limited if our accounts receivable decreases.From time to time, we may have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank. We maintain a restricted IntraFi Network Deposit account with our commercial bank which can be used as collateral against future borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, our lenders have the right to proceed against the deposit pledged to secure the indebtedness and may liquidate the IntraFi Network Deposit account in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow funds under our revolving line of credit is tied to the value of our collateral account with our commercial bank as well as the amount of our eligible accounts receivable. If our accounts receivable decrease materially for any reason, including delays, reductions or cancellations by clients or decreased demand for our services, our ability to borrow to fund operations or other obligations may be limited.Our financial results could be adversely affected by asset impairments.We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business, or strategic 9Table of Contentsdecisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and ultimately that the values associated with our equipment or intangible assets should be impaired. If we impair our equipment or intangible assets, these non-cash asset impairments could negatively affect our financial results in a material manner in the period in which the impairments are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment may have on our financial results. Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.Our revenues are determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected.In recent years, most of our projects have been performed on a turnkey basis for which we were paid a fixed price for a defined scope of work or unit of data acquired. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized under our turnkey contracts can vary from our estimates because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity or because of the performance of our subcontractors. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by external factors over which we may have no control, such as weather, obtaining land access rights, crew downtime or operational delays. These variations, delays and risks inherent in turnkey contracts may result in reducing our profitability.We face competition in our business, which could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.The seismic data acquisition services industry is a competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of periods in which seismic contractors bid jobs below cost and, therefore, adversely affected industry pricing. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are substantial but not prohibitive. The recent increase in channel count and number of energy source units required for larger projects makes it more costly and timely for new seismic companies or those outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.Inclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could, therefore, adversely affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties, which could affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations.10Table of ContentsCapital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed steadily, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cableless recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements primarily with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and, from time to time, borrowings from commercial banks. In recent years, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and finance leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially, or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, it could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage.Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively.Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. We are in a capital-intensive industry and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. However, we may have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, and certain of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so, thus affecting our ability to compete.We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment.We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could delay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers’ arrangements could affect our results of operations.Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business.We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and inability to retain our current team or attract new employees could harm our business.Our continued success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians. The loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our senior executives or other key employees or our failure to continue to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic services industry. We may experience significant competition for such personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. A limited number of our employees are under employment contracts, and we have no key man insurance.We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk.We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Currently, we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the 11Table of Contentscurrency exchange rate risk. Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume.Our stock price is subject to volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors
” section and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 were $2.65 and $1.28, respectively. Further, the high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 were $2.69 and $1.08, respectively. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “DWSN.” However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, Wilks and its affiliates own over 80% of our common stock so the public market for our common stock is more limited, which can lead to increased volatility and low trading volumes. For example, during 2023 our daily trading volume was as low as 0 shares. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile.Our common stock traded below $5.00 per share for the past year, and when it trades below $5.00 per share it may be considered a low-priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock.Our common stock may be considered a low-priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, if it continues to trade below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealer’s duties, the client’s rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the client for low-priced stock transactions based on the client’s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the client, and obtain specific written consent of the client. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low-price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock, and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchases of such stocks compared to other securities. Our common stock traded below a price of $5.00 per share for the duration of 2023 and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share.We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risk of injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business.In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct.Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. However, we do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. Further, there can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us.We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance 12Table of Contentscovering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be held liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance.We operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personnel injuries and may interrupt our business.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under extreme weather and other dangerous conditions, including the use of dynamite as an energy source. These operations are subject to risk of injury to our personnel and third parties and damage to our equipment and improvements in the areas in which we operate. In addition, our crews often operate in areas where the risk of wildfires is present and may be increased by our activities. Since our crews are mobile, equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. We use diesel fuel which is classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a hazardous material. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel and interruptions in our business. Delays due to operational disruptions such as equipment losses, personnel injuries and business interruptions could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our seismic information, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, or if we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, loss of seismic data and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats and other disruptions.We face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our business is subject to government regulation, which may adversely affect our future operations.Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation or executive orders that could negatively impact the exploration and production of oil and gas. Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods. As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods. We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services.Current and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory 13Table of Contentsmeasures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. Many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate both in the U.S. and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. However, future actions that require substantial reductions in carbon emissions could be costly and difficult to implement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated a series of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis from certain sources, including some in the oil and gas industry. While these rules do not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, they can cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations.In addition, the U.S. was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. In April 2016, the U.S. signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. In November 2020, the U.S. officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America” that will allow the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The acceptance, deposited with the United Nations on January 20, reverses the prior withdrawal. The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. As part of rejoining the Paris Agreement, President Biden announced that the U.S. would commit to a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels of GHG emissions by 2030 and set the goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. In addition, shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change. For example, the Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” sought to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that were identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proposed strict new methane emission regulations for certain oil and gas facilities and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 establishes a charge on methane emissions above certain limits from the same facilities. Additional legislation or regulation by states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the U.S. may become a party that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.The increasing governmental focus on GHG emissions may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation, other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives, or international agreements that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In addition, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our services.New regulation or legislation that limits or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate 14Table of Contentsgas production. Several political and regulatory authorities and governmental bodies have studied hydraulic fracturing and considered potential regulations, and certain environmental and other groups have devoted resources to campaigns aimed at restricting or eradicating hydraulic fracturing. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Several states have adopted more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction legislation and/or regulations. Three states (New York, Maryland and Vermont) have banned the use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. There have also been certain governmental reviews that focus on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices, including hydraulic fracturing.  Governments may continue to study hydraulic fracturing. We cannot predict the outcome of future studies, but based on the results of these studies to date, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban hydraulic fracturing activities. These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. Additional regulation could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.Some parties also believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity. These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. In light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have already modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. This could reduce demand for our services. Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing, or that requires hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Additionally, legislation that requires the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater.These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected"
7,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2023-03-13,">Item 1A.  RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed below. You should carefully consider these discussions of risk and the other information included in this Form 10-K. These risk factors could affect our actual results and should be considered carefully when evaluating us. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Current macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures in the broader U.S. economy, military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an impact on oil and gas commodity prices and, therefore, demand for our services and, depending on the duration and severity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Oil demand has deteriorated as a result of multiple global events, including inflationary pressures in the broader U.S. economy relating to the continued economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding preventative measures taken around the world to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects, and the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Factors which are likely to affect commodity prices in future periods include, but are not limited to, the effect of U.S. energy, monetary and trade policies; U.S. and global economic and political conditions and developments; energy and environmental policies; operating curtailment of the U.S. oil and gas industry; and the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreaks, which together have created future uncertainty for the demand and pricing for services, equipment, and raw materials in the petroleum industry.We are monitoring the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as the related export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others. The broader consequences of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, supply chain disruptions, regional instability and geopolitical shifts, may have adverse effects on global macroeconomic conditions, increase volatility in the price and demand for oil and natural gas, increase exposure to cyberattacks, cause disruptions in global supply chains, increase foreign currency fluctuations, cause constraints or disruption in the capital markets and limit sources of liquidity. We cannot predict the extent of the conflict’s effect on our business and results of operations as well as on the global economy and energy markets.6Table of ContentsWe face various risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and any future health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures and mandates to try to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, have impacted our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our vendors and suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the extent to which the pandemic may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will depend highly on future developments, which are very uncertain and cannot be predicted.. And any future health epidemics, pandemics or similar outbreaks could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We derive substantially all of our revenues from providers of multi-client data libraries and companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry. The oil and natural gas industry is a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend primarily on oil and natural gas prices, as well as capital allocation by our clients. Significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected, and will continue to affect, demand for our services and our results of operations. We could be adversely impacted if the level of such exploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to significantly decline in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting:●our revenues, cash flows, and profitability;●our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;●our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and●our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services.Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services, or may become unable to pay, or have to delay payment of, amounts owed to us for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including:●the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;●the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;●the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;●available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;●the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing;●actions by OPEC+;7Table of Contents●political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;●economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;●domestic and foreign tax policy;●domestic and foreign energy policy including increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy;●increased attention to environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change;●weather conditions in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere;●the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;●the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and●the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas.We are a ""controlled company"", controlled by Wilks, and as a result, are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.As of March 9,2023, Wilks Brothers, LLC (“Wilks”) and its affiliates control approximately 74.46% of our combined voting power and is able to elect all of the Company’s board of directors. As a result, we are considered a “controlled company” for the purposes of the Nasdaq listing requirements. As a “controlled company,” we are permitted to, and we may, opt out of the Nasdaq listing requirements that would require (i) a majority of the members of our board of directors to be independent, (ii) that we establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent directors, or (iii) an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. The Nasdaq listing requirements are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. Our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. It is also possible that the interests of Wilks may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of the holders of our common stock.A limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a relatively small number of oil and gas exploration and development companies and providers of multi-client data libraries. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, our three largest clients accounted for approximately 35% of our revenues. If these clients, or any of our other significant clients, were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties or for any other reason, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues.Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. If the oil and natural gas industry incurs a downturn, it may result in an increase in delays, reductions or cancellations by our clients. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding period.8Table of ContentsOur revenues, operating results and cash flows can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased client demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season, and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity during the second and third quarters of each year. The demand for our services would be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, cash flows, EBITDA, margin, and profitability from quarter-to-quarter, rendering quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance. Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability.We extend credit to our clients without requiring collateral, and a default by a client could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients’ financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our clients. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and could reduce the client’s future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients may also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period involved.We incur losses.We incurred net losses of $20,451,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and $29,091,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.The high fixed costs of our operations could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.We have indebtedness from time to time under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our accounts receivable and a restricted IntraFi Network Deposit account are pledged as collateral for these obligations. Our ability to borrow may be limited if our accounts receivable decreases.From time to time, we may have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank. We maintain a restricted IntraFi Network Deposit account with our commercial bank which can be used as collateral against future borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, our lenders have the right to proceed against the deposit pledged to secure the indebtedness and may liquidate the IntraFi Network Deposit account in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow funds under our revolving line of credit is tied to the value of our collateral account with our commercial bank as well as the amount of our eligible accounts receivable. If our accounts receivable decrease materially for any reason, including delays, reductions or cancellations by clients or decreased demand for our services, our ability to borrow to fund operations or other obligations may be limited.9Table of ContentsOur financial results could be adversely affected by asset impairments.We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business, or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and ultimately that the asset values associated with our equipment or our intangibles were to be impaired. If we were to impair our equipment or intangibles, these non-cash asset impairments could negatively affect our financial results in a material manner in the period in which they are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment may have on our financial results.Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.Our revenues are determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected.In recent years, most of our projects have been performed on a turnkey basis for which we were paid a fixed price for a defined scope of work or unit of data acquired. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized under our turnkey contracts can vary from our estimates because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity or because of the performance of our subcontractors. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by external factors over which we may have no control, such as weather, obtaining land access rights, crew downtime or operational delays. These variations, delays and risks inherent in turnkey contracts may result in reducing our profitability.We face competition in our business, which could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.The seismic data acquisition services industry is a competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of periods in which seismic contractors bid jobs below cost and, therefore, adversely affected industry pricing. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are substantial but not prohibitive. The recent increase in channel count and number of energy source units required for larger projects makes it more costly and timely for new seismic companies or those outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.Inclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could, therefore, adversely affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties, which could affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, 10Table of Contentsgovernmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations.Capital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed steadily, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cableless recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements primarily with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and, from time to time, borrowings from commercial banks. In recent years, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and finance leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially, or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, it could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage.Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively.Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. We are in a capital-intensive industry and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. However, we may have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, and certain of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so, thus affecting our ability to compete.We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment.We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could delay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers’ arrangements could affect our results of operations.Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business.We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and inability to retain our current team or attract new employees could harm our business.Our continued success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians. The loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our senior executives or other key employees or our failure to continue to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic services industry. We may experience significant competition for such personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. A limited number of our employees are under employment contracts, and we have no key man insurance.11Table of ContentsWe are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk.We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Currently, we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk. Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume.Our stock price is subject to volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors
” section and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 were $2.69 and $1.08, respectively. Further, the high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were $4.47 and $1.83, respectively. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “DWSN.” However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. In addition, as of March 9, 2023, Wilks and its affiliates own approximately 74.46% of our common stock so the public market for our common stock is more limited, which can lead to increased volatility and low trading volumes. For example, during 2022 our daily trading volume was as low as 0 shares. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile.Our common stock traded below $5.00 per share for the past year, and when it trades below $5.00 per share it may be considered a low-priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock.Our common stock may be considered a low-priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, if it continues to trade below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealer’s duties, the client’s rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the client for low-priced stock transactions based on the client’s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the client, and obtain specific written consent of the client. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low-price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock, and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchases of such stocks compared to other securities. Our common stock traded below a price of $5.00 per share for the duration of 2022 and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share.We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and, therefore, only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to shareholders.While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying cash dividends to our shareholders, our Board of Directors, after consideration of economic and market conditions affecting the energy industry in general, and the oilfield services business in particular, determined that we would not pay a cash dividend in respect of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by the board.Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of formation, or other governing documents and agreements that currently exist or could exist in the future, may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us in the future or may adversely impact your ability to obtain a premium in connection with a future change of control transaction.Our amended and restated certificate of formation contains provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we may merge or consolidate with or into another corporation or entity or sell all, or substantially all, of our assets to another corporation or entity. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board to 12Table of Contentsnine directors, we could, by resolution of the Board of Directors, stagger the directors’ terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us.In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in our best interest. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of our common shareholders without the approval of our common shareholders.We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risk of injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business.In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct.Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. However, we do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. Further, there can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us.We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be held liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance.We operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personnel injuries and may interrupt our business.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under extreme weather and other dangerous conditions, including the use of dynamite as an energy source. These operations are subject to risk of injury to our personnel and third parties and damage to our equipment and improvements in the areas in which we operate. In addition, our crews often operate in areas where the risk of wildfires is present and may be increased by our activities. Since our crews are mobile, equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. We use diesel fuel which is classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a hazardous material. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel and interruptions in our business. Delays due to operational disruptions such as equipment losses, personnel injuries and business interruptions could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our seismic information, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, or if we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, loss of seismic data and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.13Table of ContentsOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats and other disruptions.We face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our business is subject to government regulation, which may adversely affect our future operations.Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation or executive orders that could negatively impact the exploration and production of oil and gas. Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods. As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods. We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services.Current and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. Many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate both in the U.S. and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. However, future actions that require substantial reductions in carbon emissions could be costly and difficult to implement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated a series of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis from certain sources, including some in the oil and gas industry. While these rules do not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, they can cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations.In addition, the U.S. was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. In April 2016, the U.S. signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. In November 2020, the U.S. officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America” that will allow the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The acceptance, deposited with the United Nations on January 20, reverses the prior withdrawal. The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. As part of rejoining the Paris Agreement, President Biden announced that the U.S. would commit 14Table of Contentsto a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels of GHG emissions by 2030 and set the goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. In addition, shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change. For example, the Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” sought to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that were identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proposed strict new methane emission regulations for certain oil and gas facilities and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 establishes a charge on methane emissions above certain limits from the same facilities. Additional legislation or regulation by states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the U.S. may become a party that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.The increasing governmental focus on GHG emissions may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation, other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives, or international agreements that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.In addition, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our services.New regulation or legislation that limits or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Several political and regulatory authorities and governmental bodies have studied hydraulic fracturing and considered potential regulations, and certain environmental and other groups have devoted resources to campaigns aimed at restricting or eradicating hydraulic fracturing. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Several states have adopted more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction legislation and/or regulations. Three states (New York, Maryland and Vermont) have banned the use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing. In addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. There have also been certain governmental reviews that focus on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices, including hydraulic fracturing.  Governments may continue to study hydraulic fracturing. We cannot predict the outcome of future studies, but based on the results of these studies to date, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban hydraulic fracturing activities. These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. Additional regulation could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.Some parties also believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity. These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. In light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have already modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. 15Table of ContentsThe adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. This could reduce demand for our services. Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing, or that requires hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Additionally, legislation that requires the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater.These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected"
15,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2022-03-18,">Item 1A.  RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed below. You should carefully consider these discussions of risk and the other information included in this Form 10-K. These risk factors could affect our actual results and should be considered carefully when evaluating us. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.6Table of ContentsCurrent macroeconomic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on oil and gas commodity prices and, therefore, demand for our services and, depending on the duration and severity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Oil demand has significantly deteriorated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding preventative measures taken around the world to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. Significant factors which are likely to affect commodity prices in future periods include, but are not limited to, the extent and duration of travel and work restrictions worldwide; the effect of U.S. energy, monetary and trade policies; U.S. and global economic and political conditions and developments; energy and environmental policies; operating curtailment of the U.S. oil and gas industry; and the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreaks, which together have created future uncertainty for the demand and pricing for services, equipment, and raw materials in the petroleum industry.We are monitoring developments in Ukraine as well as the related export controls and financial and economic sanctions imposed on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia by the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and others. Although we do not presently foresee direct material adverse effects upon our business, financial condition or results of operations as a result of developments in Ukraine and the consequent controls and sanctions, these factors may affect companies in many sectors and could lead to increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could affect us in turn.We face various risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any future health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the measures and mandates to try to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of such measures and potential future measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Despite our ongoing efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate effect on us depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control. And any future health epidemics, pandemics or similar outbreaks could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.We derive substantially all of our revenues from providers of multi-client data libraries and companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry. The oil and natural gas industry is a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend primarily on oil and natural gas prices. Significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected, and will continue to affect, demand for our services and our results of operations. We could be adversely impacted if the level of such exploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to significantly decline in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting:●our revenues, cash flows, and profitability;●our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;●our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and●our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services.7Table of ContentsWorldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services, or may become unable to pay, or have to delay payment of, amounts owed to us for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including:●the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;●the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;●the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;●available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;●the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing;●actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries);●political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;●economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;●domestic and foreign tax policy;●domestic and foreign energy policy including increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy;●increased attention to environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change;●weather conditions in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere;●the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;●the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and●the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas.8Table of ContentsWe are a ""controlled company"", controlled by Wilks, and as a result, are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements that are designed to provide protection to stockholders of companies that are not controlled companies.As of January 14, 2022, Wilks controls approximately 74.46% of our combined voting power and is able to elect all of the Company’s board of directors. As a result, we are considered a “controlled company” for the purposes of the Nasdaq listing requirements. As a “controlled company,” we are permitted to, and we may, opt out of the Nasdaq listing requirements that would require (i) a majority of the members of our board of directors to be independent, (ii) that we establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent directors, or (iii) an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. The Nasdaq listing requirements are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standards are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. Our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements. It is also possible that the interests of Wilks may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of the holders of our common stock.A limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a relatively small number of oil and gas exploration and development companies and providers of multi-client data libraries. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, our three largest clients accounted for approximately 65% of our revenues. If these clients, or any of our other significant clients, were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties or for any other reason, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues.Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. If the oil and natural gas industry incurs a downturn, it may result in an increase in delays, reductions or cancellations by our clients. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased client demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity during the second and third quarters of each year. The demand for our services would be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, cash flows, EBITDA, margin, and profitability from quarter-to-quarter, rendering quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance. Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability.We extend credit to our clients without requiring collateral, and a default by a client could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients’ financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our clients. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, which could cause them 9Table of Contentsto default on their obligations to us and could reduce the client’s future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients may also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period involved.We incur losses.We incurred net losses of $29,091,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and $13,196,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.The high fixed costs of our operations could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.We have indebtedness from time to time under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our accounts receivable and a restricted IntraFi Network Deposit account are pledged as collateral for these obligations. Our ability to borrow may be limited if our accounts receivable decreases.From time to time, we may have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank. We maintain a restricted IntraFi Network Deposit account with our commercial bank which can be used as collateral against future borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, our lenders have the right to proceed against the deposit pledged to secure the indebtedness and may liquidate the IntraFi Network Deposit account in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow funds under our revolving line of credit is tied to the value of our collateral account with our commercial bank as well as the amount of our eligible accounts receivable. If our accounts receivable decrease materially for any reason, including delays, reductions or cancellations by clients or decreased demand for our services, our ability to borrow to fund operations or other obligations may be limited.Our financial results could be adversely affected by asset impairments.We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business, or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and ultimately that the asset values associated with our equipment or our intangibles were to be impaired. If we were to impair our equipment or intangibles, these non-cash asset impairments could negatively affect our financial results in a material manner in the period in which they are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment may have on our financial results.Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.Our revenues are determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected.10Table of ContentsIn recent years, most of our projects have been performed on a turnkey basis for which we were paid a fixed price for a defined scope of work or unit of data acquired. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized under our turnkey contracts can vary from our estimates because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity or because of the performance of our subcontractors. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by external factors over which we may have no control, such as weather, obtaining land access rights, crew downtime or operational delays. These variations, delays and risks inherent in turnkey contracts may result in reducing our profitability.We face intense competition in our business, which could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of periods in which seismic contractors bid jobs below cost and, therefore, adversely affected industry pricing. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are substantial but not prohibitive. The recent increase in channel count and number of energy source units required for larger projects makes it more costly and timely for new seismic companies or those outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.Inclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could, therefore, adversely affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties, which could affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations.Capital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed steadily, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cableless recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements primarily with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and, from time to time, borrowings from commercial banks. In recent years, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and finance leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially, or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, it could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage.11Table of ContentsTechnological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively.Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. We are in a capital-intensive industry and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. However, we may have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, and certain of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so, thus affecting our ability to compete.We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment.We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could delay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers’ arrangements could affect our results of operations.Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business.We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and inability to retain our current team or attract new employees could harm our business.Our continued success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians. The loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our senior executives or other key employees or our failure to continue to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic services industry. We may experience significant competition for such personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. A limited number of our employees are under employment contracts, and we have no key man insurance.We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk.We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Currently, we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk. Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume.Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors
” section and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 were $4.47 and $1.83, respectively. Further, the high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $2.93 and $0.84, respectively. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “DWSN.” However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. For example, during 2021 our daily trading volume was as low as 4,100 shares. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile.In addition, after the consummation of the Offer on January 14, 2022, Wilks and its affiliates own approximately 74.46% of our common stock; therefore, the public market for our common stock is more limited, which 12Table of Contentscould lead to increased volatility and low trading volumes. Shareholders that tendered their shares in the Offer received consideration of $2.34 per share.Our common stock traded below $5.00 per share for the past year, and when it trades below $5.00 per share it may be considered a low-priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock.Our common stock may be considered a low-priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, if it continues to trade below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealer’s duties, the client’s rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the client for low-priced stock transactions based on the client’s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the client, and obtain specific written consent of the client. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low-price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock, and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchases of such stocks compared to other securities. Our common stock traded below a price of $5.00 per share for the duration of 2021 and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share.We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and, therefore, only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to shareholders.While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying cash dividends to our shareholders, our Board of Directors, after consideration of economic and market conditions affecting the energy industry in general, and the oilfield services business in particular, determined that we would not pay a cash dividend in respect of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by the board.Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of formation, or other governing documents and agreements that currently exist or could exist in the future, may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us in the future or may adversely impact your ability to obtain a premium in connection with a future change of control transaction.Our amended and restated certificate of formation contains provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we may merge or consolidate with or into another corporation or entity or sell all, or substantially all, of our assets to another corporation or entity. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board to nine directors, we could, by resolution of the Board of Directors, stagger the directors’ terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us.In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in our best interest. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of our common shareholders without the approval of our common shareholders.We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risk of injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business.In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct.13Table of ContentsOur general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. However, we do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. Further, there can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us.We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be held liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance.We operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personnel injuries and may interrupt our business.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under extreme weather and other dangerous conditions, including the use of dynamite as an energy source. These operations are subject to risk of injury to our personnel and third parties and damage to our equipment and improvements in the areas in which we operate. In addition, our crews often operate in areas where the risk of wildfires is present and may be increased by our activities. Since our crews are mobile, equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. We use diesel fuel which is classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a hazardous material. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel and interruptions in our business. Delays due to operational disruptions such as equipment losses, personnel injuries and business interruptions could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our seismic information, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, or if we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, loss of seismic data and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats and other disruptions.We face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our business is subject to government regulation, which may adversely affect our future operations.Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation or executive orders that could negatively impact the exploration and production of oil and gas, including the recent executive order from the new U.S. presidential administration pausing any new oil and gas auctions on federal land and water and potential related or similar executive orders or legislation. Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods. As a result, there is a risk that there 14Table of Contentswill be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods. We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services.Current and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. Many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate both in the U.S. and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. However, future actions that require substantial reductions in carbon emissions could be costly and difficult to implement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated a series of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis, including extensive GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. While these rules do not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, they can cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations.In addition, the U.S. was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. In April 2016, the U.S. signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. In November 2020, the U.S. officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an “Acceptance on Behalf of the United States of America” that will allow the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement. The newly signed acceptance, deposited with the United Nations on January 20, reverses the prior withdrawal. The U.S. officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. As part of rejoining the Paris Agreement, President Biden announced that the U.S. would commit to a 50 to 52 percent reduction from 2005 levels of GHG emissions by 2030 and set the goal of reaching net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. In addition, shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change. For example, the Executive Order on “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis” sought to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that were identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies.  Additional legislation or regulation by states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the U.S. may become a party that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.The increasing governmental focus on GHG emissions may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation, other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives, or international agreements that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.15Table of ContentsIn addition, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities.  Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities, which may have an adverse impact on the demand for our services.New regulation or legislation that limits or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Several political and regulatory authorities and governmental bodies have studied hydraulic fracturing and considered potential regulations, and certain environmental and other groups have devoted resources to campaigns aimed at restricting or eradicating hydraulic fracturing. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Several states have adopted more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction legislation and/or regulations. Three states (New York, Maryland and Vermont) have banned the use of high-volume hydraulic fracturing.  In addition to state laws, some local municipalities have adopted or are considering adopting land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, that may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular.  There have also been certain governmental reviews that focus on deep shale and other formation completion and production practices, including hydraulic fracturing.  Governments may continue to study hydraulic fracturing.  We cannot predict the outcome of future studies, but based on the results of these studies to date, federal and state legislatures and agencies may seek to further regulate or even ban hydraulic fracturing activities. These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. Additional regulation could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.Some parties also believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity. These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. In light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have already modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. This could reduce demand for our services. Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing, or that requires hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Additionally, legislation that requires the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater.These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected"
13,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2021-03-16,">Item 1A.  RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed below. You should carefully consider these discussions of risk and the other information included in this Form 10-K. These risk factors could affect our actual results and should be considered carefully when evaluating us. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Current macroeconomic conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on oil and gas commodity prices and, therefore, demand for our services and, depending on the duration and severity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Oil demand has significantly deteriorated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and corresponding preventative measures taken around the world to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. Significant factors which are likely to affect commodity prices in future periods include, but are not limited to, the extent and duration of travel and work restrictions worldwide; the effect of U.S. energy, monetary and trade policies; U.S. and global economic and political conditions and developments; energy and environmental policies; operating curtailment of the U.S. oil and gas industry; and the severity and duration of the COVID-19 outbreaks, which together have created future uncertainty for the demand and pricing for services, equipment, and raw materials in the petroleum industry.We face various risks related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any future health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks, which may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our business and financial results may be negatively impacted by health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the measures and mandates to try to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration and severity of such measures and potential future measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Despite our ongoing efforts to manage these impacts, their ultimate effect on us depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control. And any future health epidemics, pandemics or similar outbreaks could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.6Table of ContentsWe derive substantially all of our revenues from providers of multi-client data libraries and companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry. The oil and natural gas industry is a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend primarily on oil and natural gas prices. Significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected, and will continue to affect, demand for our services and our results of operations. We could be adversely impacted if the level of such exploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to significantly decline in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting:●our revenues, cash flows, and profitability;●our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;●our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and●our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services.Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services, or may become unable to pay, or have to delay payment of, amounts owed to us for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including:●the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;●the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;●the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;●available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;●the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing;●actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries);●political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;●economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;●domestic and foreign tax policy;●domestic and foreign energy policy including increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy;●weather conditions in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere;●the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;7Table of Contents●the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and●the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas.A limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a relatively small number of oil and gas exploration and development companies and providers of multi-client data libraries. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, our three largest clients accounted for approximately 69% of our revenues. If these clients, or any of our other significant clients, were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties or for any other reason, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues.Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. If the oil and natural gas industry incurs a downturn, it may result in an increase in delays, reductions or cancellations by our clients. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased client demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity during the second and third quarters of each year. The demand for our services would be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, cash flows, EBITDA, margin, and profitability from quarter-to-quarter, rendering quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance. Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability.We extend credit to our clients without requiring collateral, and a default by a client could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients’ financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our clients. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, especially in light of the recent downturn in the oil and natural gas industry and fluctuations in commodity prices, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and could reduce the client’s future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients may also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period involved.We incur losses.We incurred net losses of $13,196,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and $15,213,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.8Table of ContentsOur ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.The high fixed costs of our operations could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.We have indebtedness from time to time under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our accounts receivable and a restricted CDARS account are pledged as collateral for these obligations. Our ability to borrow may be limited if our accounts receivable decreases.From time to time, we may have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank. We maintain a restricted CDARS account with our commercial bank which can be used as collateral against future borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, our lenders have the right to proceed against the deposit pledged to secure the indebtedness and may liquidate the CDARS account in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow funds under our revolving line of credit is tied to the value of our collateral account with our commercial bank as well as the amount of our eligible accounts receivable. If our accounts receivable decrease materially for any reason, including delays, reductions or cancellations by clients or decreased demand for our services, our ability to borrow to fund operations or other obligations may be limited.Our financial results could be adversely affected by asset impairments.We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business, or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and ultimately that the asset values associated with our equipment or our intangibles were to be impaired. If we were to impair our equipment or intangibles, these non-cash asset impairments could negatively affect our financial results in a material manner in the period in which they are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment may have on our financial results.Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.Our revenues are determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected.In recent years, most of our projects have been performed on a turnkey basis for which we were paid a fixed price for a defined scope of work or unit of data acquired. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized under our turnkey contracts can vary from our estimates because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity or because of the performance of our subcontractors. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by external factors over which we may have no control, such as weather, obtaining land access rights, crew downtime or operational delays. These variations, delays and risks inherent in turnkey contracts may result in reducing our profitability.9Table of ContentsWe face intense competition in our business, which could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of periods in which seismic contractors bid jobs below cost and, therefore, adversely affected industry pricing. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are substantial but not prohibitive. The recent increase in channel count and number of energy source units required for larger projects makes it more costly and timely for new seismic companies or those outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.Inclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could, therefore, adversely affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather. As evidenced by the recent statewide winter storm in Texas in February 2021, the ability of our crews to operate could be impacted by weather conditions for extended periods, particularly if widespread power or water outages persist. While this event did not materially impact our operations for an extended period, similar events could create circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period involved. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties, which could affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations.Capital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed steadily, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cableless recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements primarily with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and, from time to time, borrowings from commercial banks. In recent years, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and finance leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially, or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, it could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage.10Table of ContentsTechnological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively.Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. We are in a capital-intensive industry and, in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. However, we may have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, and certain of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so, thus affecting our ability to compete.We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment.We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could delay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers’ arrangements could affect our results of operations.Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business.We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and inability to retain our current team or attract new employees could harm our business.Our continued success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians. The loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our senior executives or other key employees or our failure to continue to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic services industry. We may experience significant competition for such personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. A limited number of our employees are under employment contracts, and we have no key man insurance.We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk.We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Currently, we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk. Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume.Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors
” section and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 were $2.93 and $0.84, respectively. Further, the high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $4.28 and $1.90, respectively. Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “DWSN.” However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. For example, during 2020 our daily trading volume was as low as 2,200 shares. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile.11Table of ContentsOur common stock traded below $5.00 per share for the past year, and when it trades below $5.00 per share it may be considered a low-priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock.Our common stock may be considered a low-priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, if it continues to trade below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealer’s duties, the client’s rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the client for low-priced stock transactions based on the client’s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the client, and obtain specific written consent of the client. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low-price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock, and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchases of such stocks compared to other securities. Our common stock traded below a price of $5.00 per share for the duration of 2020 and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share.We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and, therefore, only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to shareholders.While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying cash dividends to our shareholders, our Board of Directors, after consideration of economic and market conditions affecting the energy industry in general, and the oilfield services business in particular, determined that we would not pay a cash dividend in respect of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by the board.Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of formation, or other governing documents and agreements that currently exist or could exist in the future, may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us in the future or may adversely impact your ability to obtain a premium in connection with a future change of control transaction.Our amended and restated certificate of formation contains provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we may merge or consolidate with or into another corporation or entity or sell all, or substantially all, of our assets to another corporation or entity. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board to nine directors, we could, by resolution of the Board of Directors, stagger the directors’ terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us.In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in our best interest. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of our common shareholders without the approval of our common shareholders.We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risk of injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business.In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct.Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. However, we do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. Further, there can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are 12Table of Contentsacceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us.We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be held liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance.We operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personnel injuries and may interrupt our business.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under extreme weather and other dangerous conditions, including the use of dynamite as an energy source. These operations are subject to risk of injury to our personnel and third parties and damage to our equipment and improvements in the areas in which we operate. In addition, our crews often operate in areas where the risk of wildfires is present and may be increased by our activities. Since our crews are mobile, equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. We use diesel fuel which is classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a hazardous material. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel and interruptions in our business. Delays due to operational disruptions such as equipment losses, personnel injuries and business interruptions could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our seismic information, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, or if we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, loss of seismic data and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats and other disruptions.We face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our business is subject to government regulation, which may adversely affect our future operations.Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation or executive orders that could negatively impact the exploration and production of oil and gas, including the recent executive order from the new U.S. presidential administration pausing any new oil and gas auctions on federal land and water and potential related or similar executive orders or legislation. Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods. As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods. We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws 13Table of Contentsand regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services.Current and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. Many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate both in the United States and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. However, future actions that require substantial reductions in carbon emissions could be costly and difficult to implement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated a series of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis, including extensive GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. While these rules do not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, they can cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations.In addition, the United States was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. In November 2019, the State Department formally informed the United Nations of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. In February 2021, the State Department formally informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to rejoin the Paris Agreement which formally starts the 30-day process of bringing the United States back into the accord. Additional legislation or regulation by states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.The increasing governmental focus on GHG emissions may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation, other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives, or international agreements that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.New regulation or legislation that limits or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Several political and regulatory authorities and governmental bodies have studied hydraulic fracturing and considered potential regulations, and certain environmental and other groups have devoted resources to campaigns aimed at restricting or eradicating hydraulic fracturing. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, EPA issued a final report in 14Table of ContentsDecember 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources, particularly when involving water withdrawals, spills, fracturing into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment, disposal, storage and discharge of wastewater. The final report also listed the data gaps and uncertainties that limited the EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain “diesel fuel” under the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has not yet finalized this rule. In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works. These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. Certain states have also adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations. Additional regulation could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.Some parties also believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity. These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. In light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have already modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. This could reduce demand for our services. Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing, or that requires hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Additionally, legislation that requires the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater.These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected"
0,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2020-03-06,">Item 1A.  RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed below. You should carefully consider these discussions of risk and the other information included in this Form 10‑K. These risk factors could affect our actual results and should be considered carefully when evaluating us. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We derive substantially all of our revenues from providers of multi-client data libraries and companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry. The oil and natural gas industry is a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend primarily on oil and natural gas prices. Significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected, and will continue to affect, demand for our services and our results of operations. We could be adversely impacted if the level of such exploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to significantly decline in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of  6Table of Contentsexploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting: ·our revenues, cash flows, and profitability;  ·our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;  ·our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and  ·our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services, or may become unable to pay, or have to delay payment of, amounts owed to us for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including: ·the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;  ·the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;  ·the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;  ·available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;  ·the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing;  ·actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries);  ·political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;  ·economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;  ·domestic and foreign tax policy;  ·domestic and foreign energy policy including increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy;  ·weather conditions in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere;  ·the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;  ·the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and  ·the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas. We, and our clients, may be adversely affected by an economic downturn.An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan of operations and could lead to further significant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas. Reduced demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our clients and their ability to purchase our services. We are not able to predict the timing, extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate.  7Table of ContentsA limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a relatively small number of oil and gas exploration and development companies and providers of multi‑client data libraries. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, our four largest clients accounted for approximately 60% of our revenues. If these clients, or any of our other significant clients, were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties or for any other reason, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues.Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. If the oil and natural gas industry incurs a downturn, it may result in an increase in delays, reductions or cancellations by our clients. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased client demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity during the second and third quarters of each year. The demand for our services would be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, cash flows, EBITDA, margin, and profitability from quarter‑to‑quarter, rendering quarter‑to‑quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance. Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability.We extend credit to our clients without requiring collateral, and a default by a client could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients’ financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our clients. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, especially in light of the recent downturn in the oil and natural gas industry and fluctuations in commodity prices, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and could reduce the client’s future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients may also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period involved.We incur losses.We incurred net losses of $15,213,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and $24,407,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land‑based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. 8Table of ContentsThe high fixed costs of our operations could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non‑cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.We have indebtedness from time to time under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our accounts receivable and restricted CDARS accounts are pledged as collateral for these obligations. Our ability to borrow may be limited if our accounts receivable decreases.From time to time, we may have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank. We maintain certain restricted CDARS accounts with our commercial bank which can be used as collateral against future borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, our lenders have the right to proceed against the deposit pledged to secure the indebtedness and may liquidate the CDARS account in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow funds under our revolving line of credit is tied to the value of our collateral account with our commercial bank as well as the amount of our eligible accounts receivable. If our accounts receivable decrease materially for any reason, including delays, reductions or cancellations by clients or decreased demand for our services, our ability to borrow to fund operations or other obligations may be limited.Our financial results could be adversely affected by asset impairments.We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business, or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and ultimately that the asset values associated with our equipment or our intangibles were to be impaired. If we were to impair our equipment or intangibles, these non-cash asset impairments could negatively affect our financial results in a material manner in the period in which they are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment may have on our financial results.Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.Our revenues are determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected.In recent years, most of our projects have been performed on a turnkey basis for which we were paid a fixed price for a defined scope of work or unit of data acquired. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized under our turnkey contracts can vary from our estimates because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity or because of the performance of our subcontractors. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by external factors over which we may have no control, such as weather, obtaining land access rights, crew downtime or operational delays. These variations, delays and risks inherent in turnkey contracts may result in reducing our profitability.We face intense competition in our business that could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of periods in which seismic contractors bid jobs below cost and, therefore, adversely affected industry pricing. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic  9Table of Contentsindustry are not prohibitive, and it would not be difficult for seismic companies outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.Inclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could, therefore, adversely affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather.Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time‑consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations.Capital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed steadily, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cableless recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements primarily with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and, from time to time, borrowings from commercial banks. In recent years, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and finance leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially, or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, our failure could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage.Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively.Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. We are in a capital intensive industry, and in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. However, we may have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state‑of‑the‑art equipment, and certain of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so, thus affecting our ability to compete.We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment.We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could  10Table of Contentsdelay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers’ arrangements could affect our results of operations.Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business.We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and inability to retain our current team or attract new employees could harm our business.Our continued success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians. The loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our senior executives or other key employees or our failure to continue to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic services industry. We may experience significant competition for such personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. A limited number of our employees are under employment contracts, and we have no key man insurance.We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk.We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Currently, we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk. Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume.Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors
” section and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $4.28 and $1.90, respectively. Further, the high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were $8.40 and $3.04, respectively.  Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “DWSN.” However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. For example, during 2019 our daily trading volume was as low as 5,000 shares. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. Our common stock traded below $5.00 per share for the past year, and when it trades below $5.00 per share it may be considered a low‑priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock.Our common stock may be considered a low-priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, if it continues to trade below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealer’s duties, the client’s rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the client for low-priced stock transactions based on the client’s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the client, and obtain specific written consent of the client. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low-price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock, and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchases of such stocks compared to other securities. Our common stock traded below a price of $5.00 per share for the duration of 2019 and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share.  11Table of ContentsWe do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and, therefore, only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to shareholders.While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying cash dividends to our shareholders, our Board of Directors, after consideration of economic and market conditions affecting the energy industry in general, and the oilfield services business in particular, determined that we would not pay a cash dividend in respect of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by the board.Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of formation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us in the future or may adversely impact your ability to obtain a premium in connection with a future change of control transaction.Our amended and restated certificate of formation contains provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we may merge or consolidate with or into another corporation or entity or sell all, or substantially all, of our assets to another corporation or entity. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board to nine directors, we could, by resolution of the Board of Directors, stagger the directors’ terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us.In addition, our Board of Directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in our best interest. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of our common shareholders without the approval of our common shareholders.We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land‑based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risk of injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business.In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct.Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. However, we do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. Further, there can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us.We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be held liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance.We operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personnel injuries and may interrupt our business.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land‑based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under extreme weather and other dangerous conditions, including the use of dynamite as an energy source. These operations are subject to risk of injury to our personnel and third parties and damage to our  12Table of Contentsequipment and improvements in the areas in which we operate. In addition, our crews often operate in areas where the risk of wildfires is present and may be increased by our activities. Since our crews are mobile, equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. We use diesel fuel which is classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a hazardous material. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel and interruptions in our business. Delays due to operational disruptions such as equipment losses, personnel injuries and business interruptions could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer‑based programs, including our seismic information, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, or if we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, loss of seismic data and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber‑security threats and other disruptions.We face various security threats, including cyber‑security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber‑security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our business is subject to government regulation that may adversely affect our future operations.Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation. Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods. As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods. We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services.Current and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. Many states, either individually or through multi‑state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate both in the United States and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. However, future actions that require substantial reductions in carbon emissions could be costly and difficult to implement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated a series of regulations that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis, including extensive GHG monitoring and reporting  13Table of Contentsrequirements. While these rules do not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, they can cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations.In addition, the United States was actively involved in the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Paris, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. In April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which requires countries to review and “represent a progression” in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. In November 2019, the State Department formally informed the United Nations of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Due to the Paris Agreement’s protocol, the earliest the United States will be able to withdraw is November 2020. However, additional legislation or regulation by states and regions, the EPA, and/or any international agreements to which the United States may become a party that control or limit GHG emissions or otherwise seek to address climate change could adversely affect our operations.  The increasing governmental focus on GHG emissions may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation, other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives, or international agreements that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.New regulation or legislation that limits or prohibits hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Several political and regulatory authorities and governmental bodies have studied hydraulic fracturing and considered potential regulations, and certain environmental and other groups have devoted resources to campaigns aimed at restricting or eradicating hydraulic fracturing. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, EPA issued a final report in December 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources, particularly when involving water withdrawals, spills, fracturing into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment, disposal, storage and discharge of wastewater. The final report also listed the data gaps and uncertainties that limited the EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using fluids that contain “diesel fuel” under the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) Underground Injection Control Program and has released a revised guidance regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel. In May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA has not yet finalized this rule. In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works. These regulatory initiatives could each spur further action toward federal and/or state legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities. Certain states have also adopted or are considering disclosure legislation and/or regulations. Additional regulation could materially reduce our business opportunities and revenues if our customers decrease their levels of activity in response to such regulation.  Some parties also believe that there is a correlation between hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such seismic activity is called induced seismicity. The extent of this correlation, if any, is the subject of studies of both state and federal agencies. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed against other industry participants alleging damages and regulatory violations in connection with such activity. These and other ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further  14Table of Contentsregulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. In light of concerns about induced seismicity, some state regulatory agencies have already modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. The adoption of any future federal, state, foreign, regional or local laws that impact permitting requirements for, result in reporting obligations on, or otherwise limit or ban, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. This could reduce demand for our services. Regulation that significantly restricts or prohibits hydraulic fracturing, or that requires hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements, could have a material adverse impact on our business. Additionally, legislation that requires the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater.  These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected.We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act (“Section 404”). If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, or if the costs related to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in accordance with Section 404. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of clients, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability and financial condition"
8,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2019-03-06,">Item 1A.  RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed below. You should carefully consider these discussions of risk and the other information included in this Form 10‑K. These risk factors could affect our actual results and should be considered carefully when evaluating us. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We derive substantially all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, as well as providers of multi‑client data libraries which serve common clients in the industry. The oil and natural gas industry is a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend primarily on oil and natural gas prices. Significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected, and will continue to affect, demand for our services and our results of operations. We could be adversely impacted if the level of such  6 Table of Contentsexploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to significantly decline in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting: ·our revenues, cash flows, and profitability;  ·our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;  ·our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and  ·our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services, or may become unable to pay, or have to delay payment of, amounts owed to us for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including: ·the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;  ·the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;  ·the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;  ·available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;  ·the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing;  ·actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries);  ·political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;  ·economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;  ·domestic and foreign tax policy;  ·domestic and foreign energy policy including increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy;  ·weather conditions in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere;  ·the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;  ·the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and  ·the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas. We, and our clients, may be adversely affected by an economic downturn.An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan of operations and could lead to further significant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas. Reduced demand  7 Table of Contentsand pricing pressures could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our clients and their ability to purchase our services. We are not able to predict the timing, extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate. A limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a relatively small number of oil and gas exploration and development companies and providers of multi‑client data libraries. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, our two largest clients accounted for approximately 32% of our revenues. If these clients, or any of our other significant clients, were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties or for any other reason, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues.Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. If the oil and natural gas industry incurs a downturn, it may result in an increase in delays, reductions or cancellations by our clients. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased client demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices, while showing improvement over the past year, have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity during the second and third quarters of each year. The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, cash flows, EBITDA, margin, and profitability from quarter‑to‑quarter, rendering quarter‑to‑quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance. Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability.We extend credit to our clients without requiring collateral, and a default by a client could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients’ financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our clients. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, especially in light of the recent downturn in the oil and natural gas industry and fluctuations in commodity prices, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and could reduce the client’s future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients may also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period involved.We incur losses.We incurred net losses of $24,407,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and $31,790,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. 8 Table of ContentsOur ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land‑based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.We have indebtedness from time to time under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our core assets and our accounts receivable are pledged as collateral for these obligations. Our ability to borrow may be limited if our accounts receivable decrease or the value of certain of our core assets is materially impaired.From time to time, we have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our core assets as well as our accounts receivable are pledged as collateral for these borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, our lenders have the right to proceed against the assets pledged to secure the indebtedness and may sell these assets in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow funds under our revolving line of credit is tied to the value of pledged assets as well as the amount of our eligible accounts receivable. If our pledged assets become materially impaired or our accounts receivable decrease materially for any reason, including delays, reductions or cancellations by clients or decreased demand for our services, our ability to borrow to fund operations or other obligations may be limited.Our financial results could be adversely affected by asset impairments.We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business, or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and ultimately that the asset values associated with our equipment or our intangibles were to be impaired. If we were to impair our equipment or intangibles, these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our financial results in a material manner in the period in which they are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment may have on our financial results.Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.Our revenues are determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected.In recent years, most of our projects have been performed on a turnkey basis for which we were paid a fixed price for a defined scope of work or unit of data acquired. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized under our turnkey contracts can vary from our estimates because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity or because of the performance of our subcontractors. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by external factors over which we may have no control, such as weather, obtaining land access rights, crew downtime or operational delays. These variations, delays and risks inherent in turnkey contracts may result in reducing our profitability.We face intense competition in our business that could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada. Our competitors include companies with financial resources that are greater than our own as well as companies of comparable and smaller size. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of periods in which seismic contractors bid jobs below cost and, therefore, adversely affected industry pricing. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are not prohibitive, and it would not be difficult for seismic companies outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us. 9 Table of ContentsInclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could, therefore, adversely affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather.Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time‑consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations.Capital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed steadily, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cable‑less recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements primarily with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and, from time to time, borrowings from commercial banks. In recent years, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and capital leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially, or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, our failure could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage.Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively.Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. We are in a capital intensive industry, and in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. However, we may have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state‑of‑the‑art equipment, and certain of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so, thus affecting our ability to compete.We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment.We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could delay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers’ arrangements could affect our results of operations. 10 Table of ContentsSome of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business.We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and inability to retain our current team or attract new employees could harm our business.Our continued success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians. The loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our senior executives or other key employees or our failure to continue to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic services industry. We may experience significant competition for such personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. A limited number of our employees are under employment contracts, and we have no key man insurance.We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk.We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Currently, we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk. Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume.Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors
” section and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 were $8.40 and $3.04, respectively. Further, the high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $8.55 and $3.70, respectively.  Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “DWSN.” However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. For example, during 2018 our daily trading volume was as low as 11,000 shares. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. Our common stock has traded below $5.00 per share in the past year, and when it trades below $5.00 per share it may be considered a low‑priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock.Our common stock may be considered a low-priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, if it trades below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealer’s duties, the client’s rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the client for low-priced stock transactions based on the client’s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the client, and obtain specific written consent of the client. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low-price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock, and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchases of such stocks compared to other securities. As of December 26, 2018, our common stock was quoted at a closing sales price of $3.10 per share and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and, therefore, only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to shareholders.While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying cash dividends to our shareholders, our board of directors, after consideration of economic and market conditions affecting the energy industry in general, and the oilfield  11 Table of Contentsservices business in particular, determined that we would not pay a cash dividend in respect of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by the board.Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of formation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us in the future or may adversely impact your ability to obtain a premium in connection with a future change of control transaction.Our amended and restated certificate of formation contains provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we may merge or consolidate with or into another corporation or entity or sell all, or substantially all, of our assets to another corporation or entity. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board from the current eight directors to nine directors, we could, by resolution of the board of directors, stagger the directors’ terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us.In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in our best interest. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of our common shareholders without the approval of our common shareholders.We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land‑based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risk of injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business.In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct.Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. However, we do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. Further, there can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us.We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be held liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance.The high fixed costs of our operations could result in continuing or increasing operating losses.Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non‑cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in continuing or increasing operating losses. 12 Table of ContentsWe operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personnel injuries and may interrupt our business.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land‑based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under extreme weather and other dangerous conditions, including the use of dynamite as an energy source. These operations are subject to risk of injury to our personnel and third parties and damage to our equipment and improvements in the areas in which we operate. In addition, our crews often operate in areas where the risk of wildfires is present and may be increased by our activities. Since our crews are mobile, equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. We use diesel fuel which is classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a hazardous material. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel and interruptions in our business. Delays due to operational disruptions such as equipment losses, personnel injuries and business interruptions could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer‑based programs, including our seismic information, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, or if we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, loss of seismic data and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber‑security threats and other disruptions.We face various security threats, including cyber‑security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber‑security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our business is subject to government regulation that may adversely affect our future operations.Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation. Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods. As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods. We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services.Current and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change or hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. At least one‑half of the states, either individually or through multi‑state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have been under consideration by the U.S. Congress, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. The  13 Table of ContentsU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated a series of rulemakings and taken other actions that the EPA states will result in the regulation of GHG as “air pollutants” under the existing federal Clean Air Act. Furthermore, in 2010, EPA regulations became effective that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis, including extensive GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. While this rule does not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, it will cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations.This increasing governmental focus on alleged global warming may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation or other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. At the federal level, a bill was introduced in Congress in March 2011 entitled the “Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act,” or the “FRAC Act,” that would amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the “SDWA,” to repeal an exemption from regulation for hydraulic fracturing. The FRAC Act was re-introduced in Congress in June 2013, however, Congress has not taken any significant action on such legislation. If the FRAC Act or similar legislation were enacted, the definition of “underground injection” in the SDWA would be amended to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Such a provision could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act also proposes to require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In early 2010, the EPA indicated in a website posting that it intended to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and require permitting for any well where hydraulic fracturing was conducted with the use of diesel as an additive. While industry groups have challenged the EPA’s website posting as improper rulemaking, the Agency’s position, if upheld, could require additional permitting. In addition, in March 2010, the EPA commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, and a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has commenced its own investigation into hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA issued a final report in December 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources, particularly when involving water withdrawals, spills, fracturing into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment, disposal, storage and discharge of wastewater. The final report also listed the data gaps and uncertainties that limited the EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected.We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, or if the costs related to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in accordance with Section 404. Failure to achieve and maintain  14 Table of Contentseffective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of clients, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability and financial condition"
12,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2018-03-09,">Item 1A.  RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed below. You should carefully consider these discussions of risk and the other information included in this Form 10‑K. These risk factors could affect our actual results and should be considered carefully when evaluating us. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We derive substantially all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, as well as providers of multi‑client data libraries which serve common clients in the industry. The oil and natural gas industry is a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend primarily on oil and natural gas prices. Significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected, and will continue to affect, demand for our services and our results of operations. We could be adversely impacted if the level of such  6 Table of Contentsexploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to significantly decline in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting: ·our revenues, cash flows, and profitability;  ·our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;  ·our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and  ·our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services, or may become unable to pay, or have to delay payment of, amounts owed to us for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including: ·the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;  ·the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;  ·the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;  ·available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;  ·the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing;  ·actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries);  ·political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;  ·economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;  ·domestic and foreign tax policy;  ·domestic and foreign energy policy including increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy;  ·weather conditions in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere;  ·the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;  ·the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and  ·the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas. We, and our clients, may be adversely affected by an economic downturn.An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan of operations and could lead to further significant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas. Reduced demand  7 Table of Contentsand pricing pressures could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our clients and their ability to purchase our services. We are not able to predict the timing, extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate. The oil and natural gas industry is emerging from a severe downturn and prices for oil and natural gas have recently stabilized after the decline that began in the fourth quarter of 2014. If the downturn that we appear to be emerging from continues for an extended period of time, or if it becomes more extreme, it may have material adverse effects on our planned operations, level of capital expenditures and financial condition.A limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a relatively small number of oil and gas exploration and development companies and providers of multi‑client data libraries. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our two largest clients accounted for approximately 27% of our revenues. If these clients, or any of our other significant clients, were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties or for any other reason, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues.Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. If the oil and natural gas industry incurs a downturn, it may result in an increase in delays, reductions or cancellations by our clients. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased client demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices, while showing improvement over the past year, have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity during the second and third quarters of each year. The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, cash flows, EBITDA, margin, and profitability from quarter‑to‑quarter, rendering quarter‑to‑quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance. Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability.We extend credit to our clients without requiring collateral, and a default by a client could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients’ financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our clients. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, especially in light of the recent downturn in the oil and natural gas industry and fluctuations in commodity prices, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and could reduce the client’s future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients may also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period involved. 8 Table of ContentsWe incur losses.We incurred net losses of $31,266,000 and $39,792,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land‑based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.We have indebtedness from time to time under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our core assets and our accounts receivable are pledged as collateral for these obligations. Our ability to borrow may be limited if our accounts receivable decrease or the value of certain of our core assets is materially impaired.From time to time, we have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our core assets as well as our accounts receivable are pledged as collateral for these borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, our lenders have the right to proceed against the assets pledged to secure the indebtedness and may sell these assets in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow funds under our revolving line of credit is tied to the value of pledged assets as well as the amount of our eligible accounts receivable. If our pledged assets become materially impaired or our accounts receivable decrease materially for any reason, including delays, reductions or cancellations by clients or decreased demand for our services, our ability to borrow to fund operations or other obligations may be limited.Our financial results could be adversely affected by asset impairments.We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. In connection with the Merger, we recorded intangibles associated with the combination of Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson that are an asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business, or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and ultimately that the asset values associated with our equipment or our intangibles were to be impaired. If we were to impair our equipment or intangibles, these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our financial results in a material manner in the period in which they are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment may have on our financial results.Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.Our revenue is determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected.In recent years, most of our projects have been performed on a turnkey basis for which we were paid a fixed price for a defined scope of work or unit of data acquired. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized under our turnkey contracts can vary from our estimates because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity or because of the performance of our subcontractors. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by external factors over which we may have no control, such as weather, obtaining land access rights, crew downtime or operational delays. These variations, delays and risks inherent in turnkey contracts may result in reducing our profitability. 9 Table of ContentsWe face intense competition in our business that could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada. Our competitors include companies with financial resources that are greater than our own as well as companies of comparable and smaller size. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of periods in which seismic contractors bid jobs below cost and, therefore, adversely affected industry pricing. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are not prohibitive, and it would not be difficult for seismic companies outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.Inclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could, therefore, adversely affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather.Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time‑consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations.Capital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed steadily, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cable‑less recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements primarily with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and, from time to time, borrowings from commercial banks. In recent years, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and capital leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially, or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, our failure could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage.Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively.Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. We are in a capital intensive industry, and in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. However, we may have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state‑of‑the‑art equipment, and certain  10 Table of Contentsof our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so, thus affecting our ability to compete.We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment.We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could delay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers’ arrangements could affect our results of operations.Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business.We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and inability to retain our current team or attract new employees could harm our business.Our continued success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians. The loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our senior executives or other key employees or our failure to continue to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic services industry. We may experience significant competition for such personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. A limited number of our employees are under employment contracts, and we have no key man insurance.We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk.We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Currently, we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk. Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume.Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors
” section and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were $8.55 and $3.70, respectively. Further, the high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $9.00 and $2.90, respectively.  Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “DWSN.” However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. For example, during 2017 our daily trading volume was as low as 11,200 shares. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. Our common stock has traded below $5.00 per share in the past year, and when it trades below $5.00 per share it may be considered a low‑priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock.Although currently our common stock is trading above $5.00 per share, our common stock may be considered a low-priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, if it trades below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealer’s duties, the client’s rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the client for low-priced stock  11 Table of Contentstransactions based on the client’s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the client, and obtain specific written consent of the client. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low-price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock, and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchases of such stocks compared to other securities. As of July 6, 2017, our common stock was quoted at a closing sales price of $3.75 per share and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and, therefore, only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to shareholders.While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying dividends to our shareholders, our board of directors, after consideration of economic and market conditions affecting the energy industry in general, and the oilfield services business in particular, determined that we would not pay a dividend in respect of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by the board.Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of formation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us in the future or may adversely impact your ability to obtain a premium in connection with a future change of control transaction.Our amended and restated certificate of formation contains provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we may merge or consolidate with or into another corporation or entity or sell all, or substantially all, of our assets to another corporation or entity. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board from the current eight directors to nine directors, we could, by resolution of the board of directors, stagger the directors’ terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us.In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in our best interest. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of our common shareholders without the approval of our common shareholders.We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land‑based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risk of injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business.In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct.Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. However, we do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. Further, there can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us.We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be  12 Table of Contentsheld liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance.The high fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses.Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non‑cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in operating losses.We operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personnel injuries and may interrupt our business.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land‑based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under extreme weather and other dangerous conditions, including the use of dynamite as an energy source. These operations are subject to risk of injury to our personnel and third parties and damage to our equipment and improvements in the areas in which we operate. In addition, our crews often operate in areas where the risk of wildfires is present and may be increased by our activities. Since our crews are mobile, equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. We use diesel fuel which is classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a hazardous material. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel and interruptions in our business. Delays due to operational disruptions such as equipment losses, personnel injuries and business interruptions could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer‑based programs, including our seismic information, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, or if we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, loss of seismic data and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber‑security threats and other disruptions.We face various security threats, including cyber‑security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber‑security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our business is subject to government regulation that may adversely affect our future operations.Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation. Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods. As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods. We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services. 13 Table of ContentsCurrent and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change or hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. At least one‑half of the states, either individually or through multi‑state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have been under consideration by the U.S. Congress, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated a series of rulemakings and taken other actions that the EPA states will result in the regulation of GHG as “air pollutants” under the existing federal Clean Air Act. Furthermore, in 2010, EPA regulations became effective that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis, including extensive GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. While this rule does not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, it will cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations.This increasing governmental focus on alleged global warming may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation or other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. At the federal level, a bill was introduced in Congress in March 2011 entitled the “Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act,” or the “FRAC Act,” that would amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the “SDWA,” to repeal an exemption from regulation for hydraulic fracturing. The FRAC Act was re-introduced in Congress in June 2013, however, Congress has not taken any significant action on such legislation. If the FRAC Act or similar legislation were enacted, the definition of “underground injection” in the SDWA would be amended to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Such a provision could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act also proposes to require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In early 2010, the EPA indicated in a website posting that it intended to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and require permitting for any well where hydraulic fracturing was conducted with the use of diesel as an additive. While industry groups have challenged the EPA’s website posting as improper rulemaking, the Agency’s position, if upheld, could require additional permitting. In addition, in March 2010, the EPA commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, and a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has commenced its own investigation into hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA issued a final report in December 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources, particularly when involving water withdrawals, spills, fracturing into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment, disposal, storage and discharge of wastewater. The final report also listed the data gaps and uncertainties that limited the EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be  14 Table of Contentseconomically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected.We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, or if the costs related to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in accordance with Section 404. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of clients, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability and financial condition"
3,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2017-03-13,">Item 1A.  RISK FACTORSAn investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks, including those discussed below. You should carefully consider these discussions of risk and the other information included in this Form 10‑K. These risk factors could affect our actual results and should be considered carefully when evaluating us. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We derive substantially all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, as well as providers of multi‑client data libraries which serve common clients in the industry. The oil and natural gas industry is a historically cyclical industry which appears to be emerging from a severe downturn, with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices.Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend primarily on oil and natural gas prices. The oil and natural gas industry currently appears to be emerging from a severe downturn. Significant declines in oil and natural gas exploration activities and oil and natural gas prices have adversely affected the demand for our services and our results  6 Table of Contentsof operations in the past as well as currently and will continue to do so if the level of such exploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to decline in the future or if the downturn that we appear to be emerging from is extended or becomes more severe. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting: ·our revenues, cash flows, and profitability;  ·our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity;  ·our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and  ·our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services, or may become unable to pay, or have to delay payment of, amounts owed to us for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices, including: ·the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas;  ·the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves;  ·the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves;  ·available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;  ·the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing;  ·actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries);  ·political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions;  ·economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere;  ·domestic and foreign tax policy;  ·domestic and foreign energy policy including increased emphasis on alternative sources of energy;  ·weather conditions in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere;  ·the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves;  ·the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and  ·the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas.  7 Table of ContentsWe, and our clients, may be adversely affected by an economic downturn.An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan of operations and could lead to further significant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas. Reduced demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our clients and their ability to purchase our services. We are not able to predict the timing, extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate. The oil and natural gas industry appears to be emerging from a severe downturn and prices for oil and natural gas have recently stabilized after the decline that began in the fourth quarter of 2014. If the downturn that we appear to be emerging from continues for an extended period of time, or if it becomes more extreme, it may have material adverse effects on our planned operations, level of capital expenditures and financial condition.A limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.We derive a significant amount of our revenues from a relatively small number of oil and gas exploration and development companies and providers of multi‑client data libraries. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our largest client accounted for approximately 13% of our revenues. If this client, or any of our other significant clients, were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties or for any other reason, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues.Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. If the current downturn in the oil and natural gas industry that we appear to be emerging from continues for an extended period of time, or if it becomes more extreme, it may result in an increase in delays, reductions or cancellations by our clients. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows can be expected to fluctuate from period to period.Our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased client demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. The current downturn in the oil and natural gas industry that we appear to be emerging from and the related sustained declines in oil and natural gas commodity prices have resulted in declines in the demand for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity during the second and third quarters of each year. The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, cash flows, EBITDA, margin, and profitability from quarter‑to‑quarter, rendering quarter‑to‑quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance. Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability.We extend credit to our clients without requiring collateral, and a default by a client could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients’ financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our clients. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, especially in light of the recent downturn in the oil and natural gas industry and low commodity prices, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and could reduce the client’s future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients  8 Table of Contentsmay also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large clients could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues for the period involved.We incur losses.We incurred net losses of $39,792,000 and $26,279,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land‑based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.We have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our core assets and our accounts receivable are pledged as collateral for these obligations. Our ability to borrow may be limited if our accounts receivable decrease or the value of certain of our core assets is materially impaired.We have indebtedness under credit facilities with a commercial bank, and certain of our core assets as well as our accounts receivable are pledged as collateral for these borrowings. If we are unable to repay all secured borrowings when due, whether at maturity or if declared due and payable following a default, our lenders have the right to proceed against the assets pledged to secure the indebtedness and may sell these assets in order to repay those borrowings, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to borrow funds under our revolving line of credit is tied to the value of pledged assets as well as the amount of our eligible accounts receivable. If our pledged assets become materially impaired or our accounts receivable decrease materially for any reason, including delays, reductions or cancellations by clients or decreased demand for our services, our ability to borrow to fund operations or other obligations may be limited.Our financial results could be adversely affected by asset impairments.We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. In connection with the Merger, we recorded intangibles associated with the combination of Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson that are an asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant client’s business, or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and ultimately that the asset values associated with our equipment or our intangibles were to be impaired. If we were to impair our equipment or intangibles, these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our financial results in a material manner in the period in which they are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment may have on our financial results.Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.Our revenue is determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected.In recent years, most of our projects have been performed on a turnkey basis for which we were paid a fixed price for a defined scope of work or unit of data acquired. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized under our turnkey contracts can vary from our estimates because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity or because of the performance of our subcontractors. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by external factors over which we may have no control, such as weather, obtaining land access rights, crew downtime or operational delays. These variations, delays and risks inherent in turnkey contracts may result in reducing our profitability. 9 Table of ContentsWe face intense competition in our business that could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada. Our competitors include companies with financial resources that are greater than our own as well as companies of comparable and smaller size. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of periods in which seismic contractors bid jobs below cost and, therefore, adversely affected industry pricing. Many contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which may further increase competition based primarily on price. Further, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are not prohibitive, and it would not be difficult for seismic companies outside of the U.S. to enter the domestic market and compete with us.Inclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could therefore adversely affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather.Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations.Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time‑consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations.Capital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed steadily, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cable‑less recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements primarily with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and, from time to time, borrowings from commercial banks. In recent years, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and capital leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially, or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, our failure could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage.Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively.Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. We are in a capital intensive industry, and in order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. However, we may have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state‑of‑the‑art equipment, and certain  10 Table of Contentsof our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so, thus affecting our ability to compete.We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment.We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could delay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers’ arrangements could affect our results of operations.Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business.We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and inability to retain our current team or attract new employees could harm our business.Our continued success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel. A number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians. The loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our senior executives or other key employees or our failure to continue to attract and retain skilled and technically knowledgeable personnel could adversely affect our ability to compete in the seismic services industry. We may experience significant competition for such personnel, particularly during periods of increased demand for seismic services. A limited number of our employees are under employment contracts, and we have no key man insurance.We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk.We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Currently, we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts, option contracts or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk. Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume.Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this “Risk Factors
” section and in our other filings with the SEC, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 were $9.00 and $2.90, respectively. Further, the high and low sales prices of our common stock for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 were $7.31 and $1.90, respectively.  Our common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “DWSN.” However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities. For example, during 2016 our daily trading volume was as low as 6,300 shares. It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile.  11 Table of ContentsOur common stock has traded below $5.00 per share in the past year, and when it trades below $5.00 per share it may be considered a low‑priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock.Although currently our common stock is trading above $5.00 per share, our common stock may be considered a low-priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Exchange Act, if it trades below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low-priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealer’s duties, the client’s rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the client for low-priced stock transactions based on the client’s financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the client, and obtain specific written consent of the client. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low-price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchases of such stocks compared to other securities. As of February 10, 2016, our common stock was quoted at a closing sales price of $2.93 per share and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share.We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future, and, therefore, only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to shareholders.While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying dividends to our shareholders, our board of directors, after consideration of economic and market conditions affecting the energy industry in general, and the oilfield services business in particular, determined that we would not pay a dividend in respect of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by the board.Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of formation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us in the future or may adversely impact your ability to obtain a premium in connection with a future change of control transaction.Our amended and restated certificate of formation contains provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we may merge or consolidate with or into another corporation or entity or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another corporation or entity. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board from the current eight directors to nine directors, we could, by resolution of the board of directors, stagger the directors’ terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us.In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in our best interest. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of our common shareholders without the approval of our common shareholders.We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land‑based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risk of injury to personnel and damage to equipment. Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business.In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct.Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. However, we do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. Further, there can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are  12 Table of Contentsacceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us.We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be held liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance.The high fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses.Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non‑cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in operating losses.We operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personnel injuries and may interrupt our business.Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land‑based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under extreme weather and other dangerous conditions, including the use of dynamite as an energy source. These operations are subject to risk of injury to our personnel and third parties and damage to our equipment and improvements in the areas in which we operate. In addition, our crews often operate in areas where the risk of wildfires is present and may be increased by our activities. Since our crews are mobile, equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. We use diesel fuel which is classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation as a hazardous material. These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel and interruptions in our business. Delays due to operational disruptions such as equipment losses, personnel injuries and business interruptions could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer‑based programs, including our seismic information, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, or if we were subject to cyberspace breaches or attacks, possible consequences include our loss of communication links, loss of seismic data and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber‑security threats and other disruptions.We face various security threats, including cyber‑security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber‑security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and to mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our business is subject to government regulation that may adversely affect our future operations.Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate  13 Table of Contentschange legislation. Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods. As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods. We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services.Current and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change or hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services.In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHG”) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. At least one‑half of the states, either individually or through multi‑state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have been under consideration by the U.S. Congress, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has promulgated a series of rulemakings and taken other actions that the EPA states will result in the regulation of GHG as “air pollutants” under the existing federal Clean Air Act. Furthermore, in 2010, EPA regulations became effective that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis, including extensive GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. While this new rule does not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, it will cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations.This increasing governmental focus on alleged global warming may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation or other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and, thus, adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. At the federal level, a bill was introduced in Congress in March 2011 entitled the “Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act,” or the “FRAC Act,” that would amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the “SDWA,” to repeal an exemption from regulation for hydraulic fracturing. The FRAC Act was re-introduced in Congress in June 2013, however, Congress has not taken any significant action on such legislation. If the FRAC Act or similar legislation were enacted, the definition of “underground injection” in the SDWA would be amended to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Such a provision could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations, and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act also proposes to require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In early 2010, the EPA indicated in a website posting that it intended to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and require permitting for any well where hydraulic fracturing was conducted with the use of diesel as an additive. While industry groups have challenged the EPA’s website posting as improper rulemaking, the Agency’s position, if upheld, could require additional permitting. In addition, in March 2010, the EPA commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, and a committee of the U.S. House of  14 Table of ContentsRepresentatives has commenced its own investigation into hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA issued a final report in December 2016, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources, particularly when involving water withdrawals, spills, fracturing into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, fracturing directly into such resources, underground migration of liquids and gases, and inadequate treatment, disposal, storage and discharge of wastewater. The final report also listed the data gaps and uncertainties that limited the EPA’s ability to fully assess the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected.We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, or if the costs related to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in accordance with Section 404. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of clients, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability and financial condition"

11,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2015-03-16,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS Any investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business, our industry and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, perhaps significantly, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references in this Item 1A to we, us, our or the Company when used in a historical context, refer to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the closing of the Merger, and when used in the present tense or prospectively, refer to the combined company and its subsidiaries, including Legacy Dawson, following the Merger. Company Risks We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to manage effectively the businesses of Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson and realize the anticipated benefits from the combination of Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson. We believe that these anticipated benefits, which include the expansion of Legacy TGCs geographic diversity, an increase in utilization rates due to an expanded order book and the ability to enhance efficiencies because of logistical improvements, are achievable. However, it is possible that we will not be able to achieve these benefits fully, or at all, or will not be able to achieve them within the anticipated timeframe. Prior to the completion of the Merger, Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson operated independently, and there can be no assurance that their businesses can be integrated successfully. If our expectations as to the benefits of the Merger turn out to be incorrect, or we are not able to successfully integrate the businesses of Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson for any other reason, our financial and operating results and the value of our common stock (including the stock issued as Merger consideration) may be adversely affected. While certain key employees of Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson have entered into employment agreements with us that became effective at the effective time of the Merger, it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of other key Legacy TGC or Legacy Dawson employees, as well as disrupt our ongoing business or cause inconsistencies in our standards, controls, procedures and policies. Specific issues that must be addressed in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger include, among other things: ·                  integrating Legacy TGCs and Legacy Dawsons strategies, cultures and operations; ·                  retaining existing Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson clients and suppliers; ·                  adopting best practices across the combined entity and harmonizing our operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes; ·                  integrating Legacy TGCs and Legacy Dawsons corporate, administrative and information technology infrastructure; and ·                  managing any tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integration. In addition, at times, the attention of certain members of our management and the resources of our company may be focused on business aspects related to the Merger and the integration of the businesses of Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson and may be diverted from day-to-day business operations. 7 We may incur losses. Legacy TGC reported net loss of approximately $9,528,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to a net loss of approximately $6,316,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, and net income of approximately $15,672,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012. Additionally, Legacy Dawson reported a net loss of approximately $12,620,000 for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, compared to a net income of approximately $10,480,000 and $11,113,000 for its fiscal years ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Legacy TGC also reported net income for 2011, net loss for 2010 and net income for 2009 and 2008, and Legacy Dawson reported net loss for its fiscal years 2011 and 2010 and net income for its fiscal years 2009 and 2008. Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies.  Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our revenues and operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. Our revenues, operating results, and profitability may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased customer demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices continued to be volatile during the year ended December 31, 2014, and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. Our operations in Canada are also seasonal as a result of the thawing season and we have historically experienced limited Canadian activity for the second and third calendar quarters of each year. The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy.  Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, EBITDA margin, and profitability from quarter-to-quarter, which these factors render quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance.  Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability. We face intense competition in our business from companies with greater financial resources. The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada.  Our competitors include companies with financial resources that are significantly greater than our own as well as companies of comparable and smaller size. In addition, the barriers to entry in the seismic industry are not prohibitive, and it would not be difficult for seismic companies outside of the U.S. to enter the U.S. market and compete with us. Our clients could delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice, which may lead to lower than expected demand and revenues. Our order book reflects client commitments at levels we believe are sufficient to maintain operations on our existing crews for the indicated periods. However, our clients can delay, reduce or cancel their service contracts with us on short notice. In addition, the timing of the origination and completion of projects and when projects are awarded and contracted for is also uncertain. As a result, our order book as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual demand and revenues for any succeeding fiscal period. Our profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control. Our revenue is determined, in part, by the contract price we receive for our services, the level of utilization of our data acquisition crews and the productivity of these crews. Crew utilization and productivity is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, or operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays on any data acquisition survey, our results of operations may vary, and in some cases, may be adversely affected. We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk. We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.  Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 8 Capital requirements for our operations are large. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage. Seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed rather rapidly, and we expect this trend to continue. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities. Our working capital requirements remain high, primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for cable-less recording systems and more recording channels, which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images. Our sources of working capital are limited. We have historically funded our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations, cash reserves and borrowings from commercial banks. Recently, we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and capital leases. In the past, we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs through public equity offerings. If we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow, if current demand or pricing of geophysical services were to decrease substantially or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain, additional financing could be required. If we were not able to obtain such financing or renew our existing revolving line of credit when needed, our failure could have a negative impact on our ability to pursue expansion and maintain our competitive advantage. Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively. Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. Our strategy had been to upgrade our seismic data acquisition equipment on a regular basis to maintain our competitive position, however, Legacy TGC has had a maintenance capital expenditures policy in place since 2013.  We are in a capital intensive industry and have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment. Certain of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so. We rely on a limited number of key suppliers for specific seismic services and equipment. We depend on a limited number of third parties to supply us with specific seismic services and equipment. From time to time, increased demand for seismic data acquisition services has decreased the available supply of new seismic equipment, resulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay in obtaining equipment could delay our deployment of additional crews and restrict the productivity of existing crews, adversely affecting our business and results of operation. In addition, any adverse change in the terms of our suppliers arrangements could affect our results of operations. Some of our suppliers may also be our competitors. If competitive pressures were to become such that our suppliers would no longer sell to us, we would not be able to easily replace the technology with equipment that communicates effectively with our existing technology, thereby impairing our ability to conduct our business. Inclement weather may adversely affect our ability to complete projects and could therefore adversely affect our results of operations. Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. Delays associated with weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations. For example, weather delays could affect our operations on a particular project or an entire region and could lengthen the time to complete data acquisition projects. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for the delay caused by the inclement weather. We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and the loss of any of them could harm our business. We have limited management depth. The result of the loss, whether by death, departure or illness, of our President and Chief Executive Officer or other senior executives could have a material adverse effect on the ability of management to continue operations at the same level of efficiency. We extend credit to our customers without requiring collateral, and a default by a customer could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our customers. It is possible that one or more of our clients will become financially distressed, which could cause them to default on their obligations to us and could reduce the clients future need for seismic services provided by us. Our concentration of clients may also increase our overall exposure to these credit risks. A default in payment from one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues for the period involved. 9 Certain of our core assets are pledged as collateral for short term notes and other obligations that require large monthly payments. Certain assets that are critical to Legacy TGCs operations, including 7,200 channels of GSR equipment acquired in 2012, two GSX Systems with a total of 13,000 channels acquired in 2012, an 8,000 station GSX system acquired in 2012 and a 10,500 channel INOVA Hawk system purchased in 2014 are pledged as collateral to commercial banks and could be subject to foreclosure in the event that we default on our indebtedness having 36 to 60 month terms.  As of December 31, 2014, Legacy TGC had debt obligations covering the purchase of this equipment that require monthly payments between approximately $128,000 and $216,000.  These debt obligations mature at various dates ranging from June of 2015 to September of 2017.  At December 31, 2014, Legacy Dawson had three outstanding notes payable to commercial banks in the aggregate amount of $8,577,000 that were secured by a security interest in its accounts receivable, equipment and related collateral. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, Legacy Dawson had obligations of $10,227,000 with respect to 112 vehicles leased under capital leases with Enterprise Fleet Management. Any decline in our operations could inhibit our ability to make these substantial monthly payments. In view of the short terms of these notes, a failure to make the monthly payments on these notes could cause our lenders to foreclose quickly on the assets securing these notes.  The foreclosure on certain of our core assets securing these notes could severely limit our ability to continue operations. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by asset impairments. We periodically review our portfolio of equipment and our intangible assets for impairment. In connection with the Merger, we expect to record intangibles associated with the combination of Legacy TGC and Legacy Dawson that we anticipate will be a significant asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Future events, including our financial performance, sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices, reduced demand for our services, our market valuation or the market valuation of comparable companies, loss of a significant clients business, failure to realize the benefits of the Merger, or strategic decisions, could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the asset values associated with our equipment or our intangibles, if any, must be impaired. If we are forced to impair our equipment or intangibles these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our results of operations in a material manner in the period in which they are recorded, and the larger the amount of any impairment that may be taken, the greater the impact such impairment would have on our results of operations. We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance. Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risks of injury to personnel and damage to equipment.  Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents.  These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business. In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business.  Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct. We do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays. See Item 1. Business  Operating Risks and Insurance. Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us. We may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors. We often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and, consequently, engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of these subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, we could be held liable for the actions of these subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause injury to our personnel or damage to our property that is not fully covered by insurance. We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, or if the costs related to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in accordance with Section 404.  Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.  In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability, and financial condition. 10 Industry Risks We derive nearly all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, a historically cyclical industry, with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. Demand for our services depends upon the level of expenditures by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities, which depend, in part, on oil and natural gas prices. Significant fluctuations in oil and natural gas exploration activities and oil and natural gas prices have adversely affected the demand for our services and our results of operations in the past and would continue to do so if the level of such exploration activities and the prices for oil and natural gas were to decline in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, the willingness of our clients to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control, including general economic conditions and the availability of credit. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting: ·                  our revenues, cash flows, and profitability; ·                  our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity; ·                  our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and ·                  our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their capital expenditure and drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices including: ·                  the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas; ·                  the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity; ·                  the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital and debt financing; ·                  actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries); ·                  political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions; ·                  economic conditions in the United States and elsewhere; ·                  domestic and foreign tax policy; ·                  domestic and foreign energy policy including the ever increasing emphasis on alternative sources of energy; ·                  weather conditions in the United States and elsewhere; ·                  the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves; 11 ·                  the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; ·                  the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas; and ·                  an economic downturn could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows if our customers and/or potential customers, become unable to pay, or must delay payment of, amounts owing to the Company because such customers are not successful in generating revenues or are precluded from securing necessary financing. The high fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses. Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in operating losses. We and our customers may be adversely affected by an economic downturn. An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan of operations and could lead to further significant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas.  Reduced demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our customers and their ability to purchase our services.  We are not able to predict the timing, extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations. Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations. Our business is subject to government regulation that may adversely affect our future operations. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation.  Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods.  As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods.  We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services. Current and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change or hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and gas and adversely affect demand for our services. In response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases (GHG) (including carbon dioxide and methane) may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the national and state levels. At least one-half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs. Although various climate change legislative measures have been under consideration by the U.S. Congress, it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when Congress may act on climate change legislation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA) has promulgated a series of rulemakings and taken other actions that the EPA states will result in the regulation of GHG as air pollutants under the existing federal Clean Air Act. Furthermore, in 2010, EPA regulations became effective that require monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis, including extensive GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. While this new rule does not control GHG emission levels from any facilities, it will cause covered facilities to incur monitoring and reporting costs. Moreover, lawsuits have been filed seeking to require individual companies to reduce GHG emissions from their operations. These and other lawsuits relating to GHG emissions may result in decisions by state and federal courts and agencies that could impact our operations. 12 This increasing governmental focus on global warming may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our clients. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our clients, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation or other federal or state legislative or regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas where our clients operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. At the federal level, a bill was introduced in Congress in March 2011 entitled, the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act, or the FRAC Act, that would amend the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, to repeal an exemption from regulation for hydraulic fracturing. If the FRAC Act or similar legislation in the next Congress were enacted, the definition of underground injection in the SDWA would be amended to encompass hydraulic fracturing activities. Such a provision could require hydraulic fracturing operations to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The FRAC Act also proposes to require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process, which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In early 2010, the EPA indicated in a website posting that it intended to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and require permitting for any well where hydraulic fracturing was conducted with the use of diesel as an additive. While industry groups have challenged the EPAs website posting as improper rulemaking, the Agencys position, if upheld, could require additional permitting. In addition, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health, and a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives has commenced its own investigation into hydraulic fracturing practices. These legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas wells. Shale gas cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such legislation is enacted, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected. Risks Related To Our Common Stock Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume. Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors
 section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. The high and low sales prices of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $22.35 and $5.79, respectively, as adjusted for our 1-for-3 Reverse Stock Split on February 11, 2015. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol DWSN. However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities.  For example, during 2014 our daily trading volume was as low as 2,266 shares, as adjusted for our 1-for-3 Reverse Stock Split on February 11, 2015.  It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of formation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us in the future or may adversely impact your ability to obtain a premium in connection with a future change of control transaction. Our amended restated certificate of formation, as amended, contains provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we may merge or consolidate with or into another corporation or entity or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another corporation or entity. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board from the current eight directors to nine directors, we could by resolution of the board of directors stagger the directors terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us. 13 In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in our best interest. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of our common shareholders without the approval of our common shareholders. If the price of our common stock falls below $5.00 per share, it may be considered a low-priced stock and may be subject to regulations that limit or restrict the potential market for the stock. Our common stock may be considered a low priced stock pursuant to rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), if it falls below a price of $5.00 per share. Under these rules, broker-dealers participating in transactions in low priced securities must first deliver a risk disclosure document which describes the risks associated with such stock, the broker-dealers duties, the customers rights and remedies, and certain market and other information, and make a suitability determination approving the customer for low priced stock transactions based on the customers financial situation, investment experience and objectives. Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing and provide monthly account statements to the customer, and obtain specific written consent of the customer. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a low price stock would be to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for our common stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock and to increase the transaction costs of sales and purchase of such stocks compared to other securities. As of March 9, 2015, our common stock was quoted at a closing sales price of $5.04 per share and we cannot guarantee that our common stock will continue to trade at a price greater than $5.00 per share. We paid our first cash dividend in 2012 but did not pay a cash dividend in 2013 or 2014 and may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to shareholders. We paid our first cash dividend in December 2012 but did not pay a cash dividend in 2013 or 2014 and may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying dividends to our shareholders, it is at the discretion of the board of directors whether we pay any cash dividends on our common stock and depends on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. On May 14, 2013 and May 14, 2012, we paid 5% stock dividends to our shareholders. No cash or stock dividends were declared or paid in 2014. "

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, perhaps significantly, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 5 Company Risks We may incur losses. We reported net loss of approximately $6,316,000 for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to net income of approximately $15,672,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012, and net income of $10,833,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011. We also reported net loss for 2010 and net income for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007.  Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies.  Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our revenues and operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. Our revenues, operating results, and profitability may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress, or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased customer demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays, and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices continued to be volatile during the year ended December 31, 2013, and have resulted in demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability.  The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy.  Since our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, EBITDA margin, and profitability from quarter-to-quarter, which these factors render quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance.  Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability. We face intense competition in our business from companies with greater financial resources. The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada.  Our competitors include companies with financial resources that are significantly greater than our own as well as companies of comparable and smaller size. We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk. We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.  Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively. Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. Our strategy had been to upgrade our seismic data acquisition equipment on a regular basis to maintain our competitive position, however, we currently have in place a maintenance capital expenditures policy.  We are in a capital intensive industry and have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, some of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so. We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and the loss of any of them could harm our business. We have limited management depth with the result of the loss, whether by death, departure, or illness, of Wayne A. Whitener, our President and Chief Executive Officer, or other senior executives could have a material adverse effect on the ability of management to continue operations at the same level of efficiency. We have key man insurance on the life of our President and Chief Executive Officer so that, in the event of his untimely death, we would receive insurance proceeds of $1,000,000 under this policy. 6 Certain members of our management team are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements and may leave our employment at any time. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and a salesman, and the President and an Operations Supervisor of Eagle Canada are subject to employment agreements and non-competition agreements.  Members of our management team who are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements could leave upon little or no notice, which could have a material adverse effect on our managements ability to continue operations at the same level of effectiveness. Additionally, the lack of non-competition agreements would allow these members of our management team to immediately begin working for one of our competitors upon the termination of their relationship with us. This could have a negative impact on our strategic plan and our relationships with customers. We extend credit to our customers without requiring collateral, and a default by a customer could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our customers. A default in payment from one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues for the period involved. Certain of our core assets are pledged as collateral for short term notes that require large monthly payments. Certain assets that are critical to our operations, including a 5,000 channel GSR System, acquired in 2011, an additional 7,200 channels of GSR equipment acquired in 2012, two GSR Systems with a total of 13,000 channels acquired in 2012, and an 8,000 station GSX system acquired in 2012 are pledged as collateral to commercial banks and could be subject to foreclosure in the event that we default on our indebtedness having 36 to 60 month terms.  We currently have debt obligations covering the purchase of this equipment that require monthly payments between approximately $128,000 and $223,000.  These debt obligations mature at various dates ranging from August of 2014 to January of 2017.  Any decline in our operations could inhibit our ability to make these substantial monthly payments. In view of the short terms of these notes, a failure to make the monthly payments on these notes could cause our lenders to foreclose quickly on the assets securing these notes.  The foreclosure on certain of our core assets securing these notes could severely limit our ability to continue operations. We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance. Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risks of injury to personnel and damage to equipment.  Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents.  These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business. In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business.  Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct. We do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays (see Business - Operating Risks and Insurance). Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us. We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, or if the costs related to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in accordance with Section 404.  Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.  In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability, and financial condition. 7 Industry Risks We derive nearly all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, a historically cyclical industry, with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting: ·                  our revenues, cash flows, and profitability; ·                  our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity; ·                  our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and ·                  our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices including: ·                  the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas; ·                  the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity; ·                  the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital; ·                  actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries); ·                  political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions; ·                  economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  domestic and foreign tax policy; ·                  domestic and foreign energy policy including the ever increasing emphasis on alternative sources of energy; ·                  weather conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves; ·                  the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and ·                  the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas. ·                  An economic downturn could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows if our customers and/or potential customers, become unable to pay, or must delay payment of, amounts owing to the Company because such customers are not successful in generating revenues or are precluded from securing necessary financing. 8 The high fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses. Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could result in operating losses. We and our customers may be adversely affected by an economic downturn. An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan of operations and could lead to further significant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas.  Reduced demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our customers and their ability to purchase our services.  We are not able to predict the timing, extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations. Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations. Our business is subject to government regulation which may adversely affect our future operations. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation.  Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods.  As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods.  We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services. Risks Related To Our Common Stock Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume. Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors
 section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. The high and low sales prices of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2013, were $10.43 and $6.31, respectively. Our common stock is listed on the NasdaqGS Stock Market under the symbol TGE. However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities.  For example, during 2013 our daily trading volume was as low as 8,100 shares.  It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. Our officers and directors own a large percentage of our common stock, and they may exercise control over our business and affairs. Our officers and directors as a group beneficially own approximately 29% of our common stock as of December 31, 2013  As a result, they will continue to be able to exercise significant influence, and in most cases control, over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents, and significant corporate transactions.  This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business.  The continued concentrated ownership of our common stock will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares (unless the controlling group approves the acquisition). 9 Certain provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us or may adversely impact your rights as a common shareholder. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we can enter into a merger or other business combination or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board from the current six to nine directors, we could be required to stagger our directors terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest, or other similar transaction involving control of us. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in the best interest of the Company. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of the common shareholders without the approval of the common shareholders. We paid our first cash dividend in 2012 but did not pay a cash dividend in 2013 and may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to our shareholders. We paid our first cash dividend in December of 2012 but did not pay a cash dividend in 2013 and may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.  While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying dividends to our shareholders, it is at the discretion of the board of directors whether the Company pays any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Earnings, if any, are expected to be retained to fund our future operations.  On May 14, 2013 and May 14, 2012, the Company paid 5% stock dividends to its shareholders.  No stock dividends were declared or paid in 2011. "

In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could adversely affect the results of our operations. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations. Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations. Our business is subject to government regulation which may adversely affect our future operations. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation.  Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods.  As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods.  We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services. Risks Related To Our Common Stock Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume. Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors
 section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. The high and low sales prices of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2012, were $11.55 and $5.96, respectively. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol TGE. However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities.  For example, during 2012 our daily trading volume was as low as 13,176 shares.  It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. Our officers and directors own a large percentage of our common stock, and they may exercise control over our business and affairs. Our officers and directors as a group beneficially own approximately 29% of our common stock.  As a result, they will continue to be able to exercise significant influence, and in most cases control, over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents, and significant corporate transactions.  This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business.  The continued concentrated ownership of our common stock will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares (unless the controlling group approves the acquisition). 9 Certain provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us or may adversely impact your rights as a common shareholder. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we can enter into a merger or other business combination or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board from the current six to nine directors, we could be required to stagger our directors terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest, or other similar transaction involving control of us. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in the best interest of the Company. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of the common shareholders without the approval of the common shareholders. We paid our first cash dividend in 2012 but may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock may provide a return to our shareholders. We paid our first cash dividend in December 2012 but may not pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.  While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying dividends to our shareholders, it is at the discretion of the board of directors whether the Company pays any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Earnings, if any, are expected to be retained to fund our future operations.  On May 14, 2012 and May 14, 2010, the Company paid 5% stock dividends to its shareholders.  No stock dividends were declared or paid in 2011. "

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information included in this Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. Although the risks described below are the risks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to our business and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. If any of the events described below occur, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected. The market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, perhaps significantly, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Company Risks We may incur losses. We reported net income of approximately $10,833,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to a net loss of approximately $1,223,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, and net income of approximately $1,880,000 for the year ended December 31, 2009.  We also reported net income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007.  Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies.  Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. An economic downturn could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows. An economic downturn could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows if our customers, and/or potential customers, become unable to pay or must delay payment of, amounts owing to the Company because such customers are not successful in generating revenues or are precluded from securing necessary financing. Our revenues and operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. Our revenues, operating results, and profitability may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress, or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased customer demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays, and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices continued to be volatile during the year ended December 31, 2011, and have resulted in demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability.  The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy.  Since our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, EBITDA margin, and profitability from quarter to quarter, which factors render quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance.  Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability. We are dependent upon significant customers. During 2011, our largest customer accounted for approximately 17% of revenues.  During 2010, our largest customer accounted for approximately 15% of revenues.  During 2009 our largest customer accounted for approximately 31% of revenues.  In the past we have derived a significant amount of our revenues from a small number of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies.  While our revenues are derived from a concentrated customer base, our significant customers vary between years.  If we lose one or more major customers in the future, or if one or more customers encounter financial difficulties, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 6 We are dependent upon significant suppliers. During 2011 and 2010, no vendor accounted for more than 10% of our purchases.  During 2009, our two largest vendors accounted for approximately 22% and 10% of our purchases, respectively.  If we lose one or more major vendors in the future, or if one or more vendors encounter financial difficulties, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We receive revenues from customers who engage consultants for processing and interpreting the seismic data we provide. We receive revenues from customers who have engaged consultants to process and interpret the seismic data provided by us. Consultants can have a significant influence in determining which company its customers use to acquire seismic data. A consultant could recommend that its customers consider using other seismic companies. We face intense competition in our business from companies with greater financial resources. The seismic data acquisition services industry is a highly competitive business in the continental U.S. and Canada.  Our competitors include companies with financial resources that are significantly greater than our own as well as companies of comparable and smaller size. We are subject to Canadian foreign currency exchange rate risk. We conduct business in Canada which subjects us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.  Our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Technological change in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence and requirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up with these technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively. Seismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression to continue. Our strategy is to upgrade our seismic data acquisition equipment on a regular basis to maintain our competitive position. However, since we are in a capital intensive industry and have limitations on our ability to obtain the financing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, some of our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not be able to do so. We are dependent on our management team and key employees, and the loss of any of them could harm our business. We have limited management depth with the result that the loss, whether by death, departure, or illness, of Wayne A. Whitener, our President and Chief Executive Officer, or other senior executives, could have a material adverse effect on the ability of management to continue operations at the same level of efficiency. We have key man insurance on the life of our President and Chief Executive Officer so that, in the event of his untimely death, we would receive insurance proceeds of $1,000,000 under this policy. Certain members of our management team are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements and may leave our employment at any time. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, the President, Vice President of Operations, and the Operations Manager of Eagle Canada, and a salesman, are subject to employment agreements and non-competition agreements.  Members of our management team that are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements could leave upon little or no notice, which could have a material adverse effect on our managements ability to continue operations at the same level of effectiveness. Additionally, the lack of non-competition agreements would allow these members of our management team to immediately begin working for one of our competitors upon the termination of their relationship with us. This could have a negative impact on our strategic plan and our relationships with customers. 7 We extend credit to our customers without requiring collateral, and a default by a customer could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our customers. A default in payment from one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues for the period involved. Certain of our core assets are pledged as collateral for short term notes that require large monthly payments. Certain assets that are critical to our operations, including one of our ARAM ARIES recording systems, eight vibration vehicles, a 5,000 channel OYO Geospace GSR recording system, acquired in 2010, and a 5,000 channel GSR system, acquired in 2011 are pledged as collateral to our equipment lenders and commercial banks and could be subject to foreclosure in the event that we default on our indebtedness having 36 to 57 month terms.  We currently have debt obligations covering the purchase of this equipment that require monthly payments between approximately $24,000 and $188,000.  These debt obligations mature at various dates ranging from March of 2012 to August of 2014.  Any decline in our operations could inhibit our ability to make these substantial monthly payments. In view of the short terms of these notes, a failure to make the monthly payments on these notes could cause our lenders to foreclose quickly on the assets securing these notes.  The foreclosure on certain of our core assets securing these notes could severely limit our ability to continue operations. We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance. Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risks of injury to personnel and damage to equipment.  Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents.  These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business. In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business.  Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct. We do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays (see Operating Risks and Insurance). Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us. We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, or if the costs related to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to insure that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in accordance with Section 404.  Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.  In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability, and financial condition. 8 Industry Risks We and our customers may be adversely affected by an economic downturn. An economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan of operations and could lead to further significant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas.  Reduced demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our customers and their ability to purchase our services.  We are not able to predict the timing, extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate. We derive nearly all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, a historically cyclical industry, with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting: ·                  our revenues, cash flows, and profitability; ·                  our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity; ·                  our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and ·                  our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices including: ·                  the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas; ·                  the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity; ·                  the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital; ·                  actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries); ·                  political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions; ·                  economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  domestic and foreign tax policy; ·                  domestic and foreign energy policy including the ever increasing emphasis on alternative sources of energy; ·                  weather conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves; 9 ·                  the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and ·                  the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas. The high fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses. Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could adversely affect the results of our operations. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations. Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations. Our business is subject to government regulation which may adversely affect our future operations. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation.  Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods.  As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods.  We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services. Risks Related To Our Common Stock Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume. Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors
 section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. The high and low sales prices of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2011, were $ 8.58 and $ 3.66, respectively. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol TGE. However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities.  For example, during 2011 our daily trading volume was as low as 2,200 shares.  In addition, our common stock traded on the NYSE Amex (formerly the American Stock Exchange) under the symbol TGE from April 18, 2005, until November 5, 2007.  During this period of time our daily trading volume was as low as 1,600 shares.  It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. 10 Our officers and directors own a large percentage of our common stock, and they may exercise control over our business and affairs. Our officers and directors as a group beneficially own approximately 30% of our common stock.  As a result, they will continue to be able to exercise significant influence, and in most cases control, over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents, and significant corporate transactions.  This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business.  The continued concentrated ownership of our common stock will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares (unless the controlling group approves the acquisition). Certain provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us or may adversely impact your rights as a common shareholder. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we can enter into a merger or other business combination or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board from the current six to nine directors, we could be required to stagger our directors terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest, or other similar transaction involving control of us. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in the best interest of the Company. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of the common shareholders without the approval of the common shareholders. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our shareholders. While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying dividends to our shareholders, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the past, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future, however, is in the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Earnings, if any, are expected to be retained to fund our future operations.  On May 14, 2010, and May 12, 2009, the Company paid 5% stock dividends to its shareholders.  No stock dividends were declared or paid in 2011. "

The market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, perhaps significantly, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Company Risks We may incur losses. We reported a net loss of approximately $1,223,000 for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to net income of approximately $1,880,000 and $6,898,000 reported for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  We also reported net income for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006.  Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and development companies.  Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. 5 The recent economic downturn could continue to adversely affect our revenues and cash flows. The recent economic downturn could continue to adversely affect our revenues and cash flows if our customers, and/or potential customers, become unable to pay or must delay payment of, amounts owing to the Company because such customers are not successful in generating revenues or are precluded from securing necessary financing. Our revenues and operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period to period. Our revenues, operating results, and profitability may fluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to the level of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation, progress, or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenses on our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add in the future to meet increased customer demand. Fluctuations in our operating results may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such as permit delays, weather delays, and crew productivity. Oil and natural gas prices  continued to be  volatile during the year ended December 31, 2010, and have resulted in demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability.  The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy.  Since our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, EBITDA margin, and profitability from quarter to quarter, which factors render quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance.  Due to the factors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues and profitability. We are dependent upon significant customers. During 2010, our largest customer accounted for approximately 15% of revenues.  During 2009, our  largest customer accounted for approximately 31% of revenues.  During 2008 our two largest customers accounted for approximately 27% of revenues.  In the past we have derived a significant amount of our revenues from a small number of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies.  While our revenues are derived from a concentrated customer base, our significant customers vary between years.  If we lose one or more major customers in the future, or if one or more customers encounter financial difficulties, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are dependent upon significant suppliers. During 2010, no vendor accounted for more than 10% of our purchases.  During 2009, our two largest vendors accounted for approximately 22% and 10% of our purchases, respectively.  During 2008, no vendor accounted for more that 10% of our purchases.  If we lose one or more major vendors in the future, or if one or more vendors encounter financial difficulties, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We receive revenues from customers who engage consultants for processing and interpreting the seismic data we provide. We receive revenues from customers who have engaged consultants to process and interpret the seismic data provided by us.

Whitener, our President and Chief Executive Officer, or other senior executives, could have a material adverse effect on the ability of management to continue operations at the same level of efficiency. We have key man insurance on the life of our President and Chief Executive Officer so that, in the event of his untimely death, we would receive insurance proceeds of $1,000,000 under this policy. Certain members of our management team are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements and may leave our employment at any time. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, and the President, the Vice President of Operations, and the Operations Manager of Eagle Canada, are subject to employment agreements and non-competition agreements.  Members of our management team that are not subject to employment or non-competition agreements could leave upon little or no notice which could have a material adverse effect on our managements ability to continue operations at the same level of effectiveness. Additionally, the lack of non-competition agreements would allow these members of our management team to immediately begin working for one of our competitors upon the termination of their relationship with us. This could have a negative impact on our strategic plan and our relationships with customers. We extend credit to our customers without requiring collateral, and a default by a customer could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our customers. A default in payment from one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues for the period involved. Certain of our core assets are pledged as collateral for short term notes that require large monthly payments. Certain assets that are critical to our operations, including three of our ARAM ARIES recording systems, 13 vibration vehicles, and a 5,000 channel Geospace GSR recording system, acquired in 2010, are pledged as collateral to our equipment lenders and commercial banks and could be subject to foreclosure in the event that we default on our indebtedness having 36 to 57 month terms.  We currently have debt obligations covering the purchase of this equipment that require monthly payments between approximately $80,000 and $103,000.  These debt obligations mature at various dates ranging from July of 2011 to December of 2013.  Any decline in our operations could inhibit our ability to make these substantial monthly payments. In view of the short terms of these notes, a failure to make the monthly payments on these notes could cause our lenders to foreclose quickly on the assets securing these notes.  The foreclosure on certain of our core assets securing these notes could severely limit our ability to continue operations. 7 We may be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance. Our business is subject to the general risks inherent in land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are often conducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subject to risks of injury to personnel and damage to equipment.  Our crews are mobile, and equipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents.  These risks could cause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, and interruptions in our business. In addition, we could be subject to personal injury or real property damage claims in the normal operation of our business.  Such claims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in our general service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to our negligence or intentional misconduct. We do not carry insurance against certain risks that could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipment maintenance or weather delays (see Operating Risks and Insurance). Our general service agreements require us to have specific amounts of insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that any insurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms which are acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on us. We are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404, or if the costs related to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to maintain adequate internal controls in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended, supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to insure that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis in accordance with Section 404.  Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.  In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business, profitability, and financial condition. Industry Risks We and our customers may be adversely affected by the recent recession. The recent recession could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan of operations and could lead to further significant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas.  Reduced demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of our customers and their ability to purchase our services.  We are not able to predict the timing, extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate. We derive nearly all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gas exploration and development industry, a historically cyclical industry, with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and natural gas prices. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways by negatively affecting: ·                  our revenues, cash flows, and profitability; ·                  our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity; 8 ·                  our ability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital; and ·                  our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military events have contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies may cancel or curtail their drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for our services. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historically and, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond our control affect oil and natural gas prices including: ·                  the cost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas; ·                  the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity; ·                  the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital; ·                  actions by OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries); ·                  political instability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producing regions; ·                  economic conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  domestic and foreign tax policy; ·                  domestic and foreign energy policy including the ever increasing emphasis on alternative sources of energy; ·                  weather conditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production of their national reserves; ·                  the price of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and ·                  the overall supply and demand for oil and natural gas. The high fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses. Companies within our industry are typically subject to high fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment and crew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well as new equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes could adversely affect the results of our operations. Our operations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of way from third parties which could affect our results of operations. Our seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. Delays associated with obtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations. 9 Our business is subject to government regulation which may adversely affect our future operations. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and provincial and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and archeological sites and those that may result from climate change legislation.  Canadian operations have been historically cyclical due to governmental restrictions on seismic acquisition during certain periods.  As a result, there is a risk that there will be a significant amount of unused equipment during those periods.  We are required to expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws and related permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate` that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditures historically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing exploration and development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our services. Risks Related To Our Common Stock Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatility and low trading volume. Our stock price is subject to significant volatility. Overall market conditions, including a decline in oil and natural gas prices and other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors
 section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. The high and low sales prices of our common stock for the year ended December 31, 2010, were $ 4.64 and $ 2.82, respectively. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC under the symbol TGE. However, daily trading volumes for our common stock are, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publicly traded securities.  For example, during 2010 our daily trading volume was as low as 1,200 shares.  In addition, our common stock traded on the NYSE Amex (formerly the American Stock Exchange) under the symbol TGE from April 18, 2005, until November 5, 2007.  During this period of time our daily trading volume was as low as 1,600 shares.  It may be difficult for you to sell your shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and the price of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. Our officers and directors own a large percentage of our common stock, and they may exercise control over our business and affairs. Our officers and directors as a group beneficially own approximately 31% of our common stock.  As a result, they will continue to be able to exercise significant influence, and in most cases control, over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, changes to our charter documents, and significant corporate transactions.  This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business.  The continued concentrated ownership of our common stock will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and for you to receive any related takeover premium for your shares (unless the controlling group approves the acquisition). Certain provisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us or may adversely impact your rights as a common shareholder. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares before we can enter into a merger or other business combination or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, if we increase the size of our board from the current six to nine directors, we could be required to stagger our directors terms, and our directors could not be removed without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest, or other similar transaction involving control of us. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in the best interest of the Company. The terms of such preferred stock may adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of the common shareholders without the approval of the common shareholders. 10   We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our shareholders. While there are currently no restrictions prohibiting us from paying dividends to our shareholders, we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock in the past, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future, however, is in the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legal requirements, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Earnings, if any, are expected to be retained to fund our future operations.  On May 14, 2010, and May 12, 2009, the Company paid 5% stock dividends to its shareholders. "
10,DWSN,DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL CO,2009-03-16,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS Any investment in our common stock involves a highdegree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below and the other information included in this Form 10-Kbefore purchasing our common stock. Although the risks described below are therisks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to ourbusiness and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, includingthose that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial,may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results ofoperations. If any of the events described below occur, our business andfinancial results could be materially and adversely affected. The market priceof our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, perhapssignificantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Company Risks Wehave a history of losses, and we may incur losses again. Although we reported net income of approximately$6,898,000, $7,607,000 and $8,111,000 for the years ended December 31,2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, we have a history of losses with only sixprofitable years since 1998.  In 2005, wehad net income (before dividend requirements on preferred stock) of approximately$6,201,000, in 2004, we had net income (before dividend requirements onpreferred stock) of approximately $2,868,000, and in 2003 we had net income(before dividend requirements on preferred stock) of approximately $555,000.Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyondour control, but primarily on the level of demand for land-based seismic dataacquisition services by oil and natural gas exploration and developmentcompanies.  Even if we do achieveprofitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on aquarterly or annual basis. The current economic downturn could adverselyaffect our revenues and cash flows. The current economic downturn could adversely affectour revenues and cash flows if our customers, and/or potential customers,become unable to pay or must delay payment of, amounts owing to the Companybecause such customers are not successful in generating revenues or areprecluded from securing necessary financing. Our revenues and operating results can be expected tofluctuate from period to period. Our revenues, operating results, and profitability mayfluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to thelevel of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation,progress, or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenseson our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add inthe future to meet increased customer demand. Fluctuations in our operating resultsmay also be affected by other factors that are outside of our control such aspermit delays, weather delays, and crew productivity. Oil and natural gasprices were highly volatile during the year ended December 31, 2008, andhave resulted in demand fluctuations for our services. There can be noassurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability.  The demand for our services will be adverselyaffected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices. Since ourbusiness has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of thesefactors could trigger wide variations in our operating revenues, EBITDA margin,and profitability from quarter to quarter, which factors renderquarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as an indicator of performance.  Due to the factors discussed above, youshould not expect sequential growth in our quarterly revenues andprofitability. 5Tableof Contents We are dependent upon significant customers. During 2008, our two largest customers accounted forapproximately 27% of revenues.  During2007 our two largest customers accounted for approximately 22% ofrevenues.  During 2006 no customeraccounted for 10% of our revenues.  Inthe past we have derived a significant amount of our revenues from a smallnumber of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies.  While our revenues are derived from aconcentrated customer base, our significant customers vary between years. If welose one or more major customers in the future, or if one or more customersencounter financial difficulties, our business, financial condition, andresults of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Wereceive revenues from customers who engage consultants for processing andinterpreting the seismic data we provide. We receive revenues from customers who have engagedconsultants to process and interpret the seismic data provided by us. Consultantscan have an influence in determining which company its customers use to acquireseismic data. A consultant could recommend that its customers consider usingother seismic companies. Weface intense competition in our business from companies with greater financialresources. The seismic data acquisition services industry is ahighly competitive business in the continental U.S. Our competitors includecompanies with financial resources that are significantly greater than our ownas well as companies of comparable and smaller size. Technologicalchange in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence andrequirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up withthese technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively. Seismic data acquisition technologies historicallyhave steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression tocontinue. Our strategy is to upgrade our seismic data acquisition equipment ona regular basis to maintain our competitive position. However, since we are ina capital intensive industry and have limitations on our ability to obtain thefinancing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, someof our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not beable to do so. Weare dependent on our management team and key employees, and the loss of any ofthem could harm our business. We have limited management depth with the result thatthe loss, whether by death, departure, or illness, of Wayne A. Whitener, ourPresident and Chief Executive Officer, or other senior executives, could have amaterial adverse effect on the ability of management to continue operations atthe same level of efficiency. We have key man insurance on the life of ourPresident and Chief Executive Officer so that, in the event of his untimelydeath, we would receive insurance proceeds of $1,000,000 under this policy. Certain members of our management team are not subject toemployment or non-competition agreements and may leave our employment at anytime. None of the members of our management team, other thanour President and Chief Executive Officer, are subject to employment agreementsor non-competition agreements; therefore, any of these members of ourmanagement team could leave upon little or no notice which could have amaterial adverse effect on our managements ability to continue operations atthe same level of effectiveness. Additionally, the lack of non-competitionagreements would allow these members of our management team to immediatelybegin working for one of our competitors upon the termination of theirrelationship with us. This could have a negative impact on our strategic planand our relationships with customers. 6Tableof Contents We extend credit to our customers without requiringcollateral, and a default by a customer could have a material adverse effect onour operating revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customersfinancial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our customers.A default in payment from one of these large customers could have a materialadverse effect on our operating revenues for the period involved. Certainof our core assets are pledged as collateral for short term notes that requirelarge monthly payments. Certain assets that are critical to our operations,including two of our ARAM ARIES recording systems and 13 vibration vehicles arepledged as collateral to our equipment lenders and commercial banks and couldbe subject to foreclosure in the event that we default on our indebtednesshaving 36 to 57 month terms. We currently have debt obligations covering the purchaseof two of our eight ARAM ARIES recording systems that require monthly paymentsbetween approximately $86,000 and $108,000 for the seventh ARAM ARIES recordingsystem, and between approximately $80,000 and $98,000 for the eighth ARAM ARIESrecording system.  These debt obligationsmature in December 2011 and October 2012, respectively.  The Company also has debt obligationscovering the purchase of five vibration vehicles requiring monthly paymentsbetween approximately $56,000 and $65,000, and the purchase of eight vibrationvehicles, requiring monthly payments of approximately $50,000.  These debt obligations mature in August 2011and February 2013, respectively. Any decline in our operations could inhibit our ability to make thesesubstantial monthly payments. In light of the short terms of these notes, afailure to make the monthly payments on these notes could cause our lenders topromptly foreclose on the assets securing these notes. The foreclosure oncertain of our core assets securing these notes could severely limit ourability to continue operations. Wemay be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance. Our business is subject to the general risks inherentin land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are oftenconducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subjectto risks of injury to personnel and equipment. Our crews are mobile, andequipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks couldcause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, andinterruptions in our business. In addition, we could be subject to personal injury orreal property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Suchclaims may not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in ourgeneral service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to ournegligence or intentional misconduct. We do not carry insurance against certain risks thatcould cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipmentmaintenance or weather delays. We obtain insurance against certain property andpersonal casualty risks and other risks when such insurance is available andwhen our management considers it advisable to do so. Our current insurancecoverage consists of employers liability with limits of $1,000,000 per accidentand $2,000,000 in the aggregate, commercial general liability of $1,000,000 peraccident and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, pollution liability of $1,000,000 peraccident and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, and automobile liability with a$1,000,000 combined single limit, and a $10,000,000 umbrella policy. Our general service agreements require us to havespecific amounts of insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that anyinsurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities orthat this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms whichare acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceedthe policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverseeffect on us. We are subjectto the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we areunable to maintain compliance with Section 404 or if the costs related tomaintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, andresults of operations and financial condition could be materially adverselyaffected. If we are unable to maintain adequate internalcontrols, in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended,supplemented, or modified from time to time, we may not be able to ensure thatwe have effective  7Tableof Contents internal controls overfinancial reporting in accordance with Section 404 on an ongoingbasis.  Failure to achieve and maintaineffective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stockprice.  In addition, a material weaknessin the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting couldresult in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce ourability to obtain financing, and/or require additional expenditures to complywith these requirements, each of which could negatively impact our business,profitability, and financial condition. Industry Risks We and our customers may be adverselyaffected by the current economic downturn. A slowing of the economy, and certainly a recession, could have amaterial adverse effect on our financial results and proposed plan ofoperations.  Either could lead to furthersignificant fluctuations in the demand for and pricing of oil and gas.  Reduced demand and pricing pressures couldadversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of ourcustomers and their ability to purchase our services.  We are not able to predict the timing,extent, and duration of the economic cycles in the markets in which we operate. Wederive all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gasexploration and development industry, a historically cyclical industry, withlevels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatilityof oil and natural gas prices. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level ofexploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oiland natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways bynegatively affecting: ·                  ourrevenues, cash flows, and profitability; ·                  ourability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity; ·                  ourability to obtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost ofthat capital; and ·                  ourability to attract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the eventof an upturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military eventshave contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely tocontinue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil andnatural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies maycancel or curtail their drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for ourservices. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historicallyand, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond ourcontrol affect oil and natural gas prices, including: ·                  thecost of exploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas; ·                  thediscovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  therate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  availablepipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity; ·                  theability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital; ·                  actionsby OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries); ·                  politicalinstability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producingregions; ·                  economicconditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  domesticand foreign tax policy; 8Tableof Contents ·                  weatherconditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  thepace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration, development, andproduction of their national reserves; ·                  theprice of foreign imports of oil and natural gas; and ·                  theoverall supply and demand for oil and natural gas. Thehigh fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses. Companies within our industry are typically subject tohigh fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) andmaintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment andcrew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well asnew equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periodsof significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weatherinterruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes couldadversely affect the results of our operations. Ouroperations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of wayfrom third parties which could affect our results of operations. Our seismic data acquisition operations could beadversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage fromboth public and private land and/or mineral owners. Delays associated withobtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations. Ourbusiness is subject to government regulation which may adversely affect ourfuture operations. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal,state, and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relatingto the protection of the environment and archeological sites. We are requiredto expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws andrelated permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we willcontinue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditureshistorically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws orregulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost orimpact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption oflaws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing explorationand development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect ouroperations by reducing the demand for our services. Risks RelatedTo Our Common Stock Our common stock has experienced, and may continue toexperience, price volatility and low trading volume. Our stock price is subject to significant volatility.Overall market conditions including a decline in oil and natural gas prices, inaddition to other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors
section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could cause the market price ofour common stock to fall. The high and low sales prices of our common stock forthe year ended December 31, 2008, were $10.17 and $1.05, respectively. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock MarketLLC under the symbol TGE. However, daily trading volumes for our common stockare, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publiclytraded securities. For example, during 2008, our daily trading volume was aslow as 4,800 shares.  Since November 6,2007, when we began trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, our daily tradingvolume has been as low as 2,800 shares. In addition, our common stock traded on the NYSE Alternext US (formerlythe American Stock Exchange) under the symbol TGE from April 18, 2005until November 5, 2007.  During thisperiod of time our daily trading volume was as low as 1,600 shares.  It may be difficult for you to sell yourshares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and theprice of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. 9Tableof Contents Our officers and directors own a large percentage of ourcommon stock, and they may exercise control over our business and affairs. Our officers and directors as a group beneficially ownapproximately 28.7% of our common stock. As a result, they will continue to beable to exercise significant influence, and in most cases control, over mattersrequiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, changes toour charter documents, and significant corporate transactions. Thisconcentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group ofholders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed orthe direction of our business. The continued concentrated ownership of ourcommon stock will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and foryou to receive any related takeover premium for your shares (unless thecontrolling group approves the acquisition). Certainprovisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation may make it difficult fora third party to acquire us or may adversely impact your rights as a commonshareholder. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation containprovisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued andoutstanding shares before we can enter into a merger or other businesscombination or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, if weincrease the size of our board from the current six to nine directors, we couldbe required to stagger our directors terms, and our directors could not beremoved without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstanding shares.These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxy contest, orother similar transaction involving control of us. In addition, our board of directors has the right toissue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in thebest interest of the Company.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below and the other information included in this Form 10-Kbefore purchasing our common stock. Although the risks described below are therisks that we believe are material, they are not the only risks relating to ourbusiness and our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties, includingthose that are not yet identified or that we currently believe are immaterial,may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results ofoperations. If any of the events described below occur, our business andfinancial results could be materially and adversely affected. The market priceof our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, perhapssignificantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Company Risks Wehave a history of losses, and we may incur losses again. Although we reported net income of approximately$7,607,000 and $8,111,000 for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,and net income (before dividend requirements on preferred stock) ofapproximately $6,201,000 for the year ended December 31, 2005, we have ahistory of losses with only five profitable years since 1998.  In 2004, we had net income (before dividendrequirements on preferred stock) of approximately $2,868,000, and in 2003 wehad net income (before dividend requirements on preferred stock) ofapproximately $555,000. Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend onmany factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand forland-based seismic data acquisition services by oil and natural gas explorationand development companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not beable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Ourrevenues and operating results can be expected to fluctuate from period toperiod. Our revenues, operating results, and profitability mayfluctuate from period to period. These fluctuations are attributable to thelevel of new business in a particular period, the timing of the initiation,progress, or cancellation of significant projects, higher revenues and expenseson our dynamite contracts, and costs we incur to train new crews we may add inthe future to meet increased customer demand. Fluctuations in our operatingresults may also be affected by other factors that are outside of our controlsuch as permit delays, weather delays, and crew productivity. Oil and naturalgas prices are at record highs and have resulted in increasing demand for ourservices. There can be no assurance that such high prices will continue. Thedemand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reductionin oil and natural gas prices. Since our business has high fixed costs, thenegative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variationsin our operating revenues, EBITDA margin, and profitability from quarter toquarter, which factors render quarter-to-quarter comparisons unreliable as anindicator of performance.  Due to thefactors discussed above, you should not expect sequential growth in ourquarterly revenues and profitability. Weare implementing a growth strategy which, if successful, will place significantdemands on us and subject us to numerous risks. Growing businesses often have difficulty managingtheir growth. If our growth strategy is successful, significant demands will beplaced on our management, accounting, financial, information, and other systemsand on our business. We will have to expand our management and continue recruitingand employing experienced 5 executives and key employees capable of providing thenecessary support. In addition, to manage our anticipated growth we will needto continue to improve our financial, accounting, information, and othersystems.  Doing so could causesubstantial additional expenses that could harm our financial results. Wecannot assure you that our management will be able to manage our growtheffectively or successfully. Our failure to meet these challenges couldmaterially impair our business. Weare dependent upon significant customers. During 2007 our two largest customers accounted forapproximately 22.0 % of revenues.  During2006 no customer accounted for 10% of our revenues.  During 2005 our two largest customersaccounted for approximately 22.2% of revenues. In the past we have derived a significant amount of our revenues from asmall number of oil and natural gas exploration and development companies.  While our revenues are derived from aconcentrated customer base, our significant customers may vary between years.If we lose one or more major customers in the future, or if one or morecustomers encounter financial difficulties, our business, financial condition,and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Wereceive revenues from customers who engage consultants for processing andinterpreting the seismic data we provide. We receive revenues from customers who have engagedconsultants to process and interpret the seismic data provided by us.Consultants can have an influence in determining which company its customersuse to acquire seismic data. A consultant could recommend that its customers considerusing other seismic companies. Weface intense competition in our business from companies with greater financialresources. The seismic data acquisition services industry is ahighly competitive business in the continental U.S. Our competitors includecompanies with financial resources that are significantly greater than our ownas well as companies of comparable and smaller size. Technologicalchange in our business creates risks of technological obsolescence andrequirements for future capital expenditures. If we are unable to keep up withthese technological advances, we may not be able to compete effectively. Seismic data acquisition technologies historicallyhave steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this progression tocontinue. Our strategy is to upgrade our seismic data acquisition equipment ona regular basis to maintain our competitive position. However, since we are ina capital intensive industry and have limitations on our ability to obtain thefinancing necessary to enable us to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, someof our competitors may be able to purchase newer equipment when we may not beable to do so. Weare dependent on our management team and key employees, and the loss of any ofthem could harm our business. We have limited management depth with the result thatthe loss, whether by death, departure, or illness, of Wayne A. Whitener, ourPresident and Chief Executive Officer, or other senior executives, could have amaterial adverse effect on the ability of management to continue operations atthe same level of efficiency. We have key man insurance on the life of ourPresident and Chief Executive Officer so that, in the event of his untimelydeath, we would receive insurance proceeds of $1,000,000 under this policy. Certainmembers of our management team are not subject to employment or non-competitionagreements and may leave our employment at any time. None of the members of our management team, other thanour President and Chief Executive Officer, are subject to employment agreementsor non-competition agreements; therefore, any of these members of ourmanagement team could leave upon little or no notice which could have amaterial adverse effect on our 6 managements ability to continue operations at thesame level of effectiveness. Additionally, the lack of non-competitionagreements would allow these members of our management team to immediatelybegin working for one of our competitors upon the termination of theirrelationship with us. This could have a negative impact on our strategic planand our relationships with customers. Weextend credit to our customers without requiring collateral, and a default by acustomer could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenues. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customersfinancial conditions and, generally, require no collateral from our customers.A default in payment from one of these large customers could have a materialadverse effect on our operating revenues for the period involved. Certainof our core assets are pledged as collateral for short term notes that requirelarge monthly payments. Certain assets that are critical to our operations,including three of our ARAM ARIES recording systems, are pledged as collateralto our equipment lenders and could be subject to foreclosure in the event thatwe default on our indebtedness having 36 to 48 month terms. We currently havedebt obligations covering the purchase of three of our seven ARAM ARIESrecording systems that require monthly payments between approximately $94,000and $114,000 for the second ARAM ARIES recording system, between approximately$106,000 and $130,000 for the fourth ARAM ARIES recording system, and betweenapproximately $86,000 and $108,000 for the seventh ARAM ARIES recording system.These debt obligations mature in June 2008, December 2008, and December 2011,respectively.  Any decline in ouroperations could inhibit our ability to make these substantial monthly payments.In light of the short terms of these notes, a failure to make the monthlypayments on these notes could cause our lenders to promptly foreclose on theassets securing these notes. The foreclosure of certain of our core assetssecuring these notes could severely limit our ability to continue operations. Wemay be subject to liability claims that are not covered by our insurance. Our business is subject to the general risks inherentin land-based seismic data acquisition activities. Our activities are oftenconducted in remote areas under dangerous conditions, including the detonation of dynamite. These operations are subjectto risks of injury to personnel and equipment. Our crews are mobile, andequipment and personnel are subject to vehicular accidents. These risks couldcause us to experience equipment losses, injuries to our personnel, andinterruptions in our business. In addition, we could be subject to personal injury orreal property damage claims in the normal operation of our business. Such claimsmay not be covered under the indemnification provisions contained in ourgeneral service agreements to the extent that the damage is due to ournegligence or intentional misconduct. We do not carry insurance against certain risks thatwe could cause losses, including business interruption resulting from equipmentmaintenance or weather delays. We obtain insurance against certain property andpersonal casualty risks and other risks when such insurance is available andwhen our management considers it advisable to do so. Our current insurancecoverage consists of employers liability with limits of $1,000,000 per accidentand $2,000,000 in the aggregate, commercial general liability of $1,000,000 peraccident and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, pollution liability of $1,000,000 peraccident and $2,000,000 in the aggregate, and automobile liability with a$1,000,000 combined single limit, and a $10,000,000 umbrella policy. Our general service agreements require us to havespecific amounts of insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that anyinsurance obtained by us will be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities orthat this insurance will continue to be available or available on terms whichare acceptable to us. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceedthe policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a materially adverseeffect on us. 7 Weare subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.If we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404 or if the costsrelated to maintaining compliance are significant, our profitability, stockprice, and results of operations and financial condition could be materiallyadversely affected. If we are unable to maintain adequate internalcontrols, in accordance with Section 404, as such standards are amended,supplemented, or modified from time to time we may not be able to ensure thatwe have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance withSection 404 on an ongoing basis. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have amaterial adverse effect on our stock price. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internalcontrol over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraudand the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing, and/orrequire additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each ofwhich could negatively impact our business, profitability, and financialcondition. IndustryRisks Wederive all of our revenues from companies in the oil and natural gasexploration and development industry, a historically cyclical industry, withlevels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatilityof oil and natural gas prices. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level ofexploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oiland natural gas prices or otherwise, could adversely impact us in many ways bynegatively affecting: ·                  our revenues,cash flows, and profitability; ·                  our ability tomaintain or increase our borrowing capacity; ·                  our ability toobtain additional capital to finance our business and the cost of that capital;and ·                  our ability toattract and retain skilled personnel whom we would need in the event of anupturn in the demand for our services. Worldwide political, economic, and military eventshave contributed to oil and natural gas price volatility and are likely tocontinue to do so in the future. Depending on the market prices of oil andnatural gas, oil and natural gas exploration and development companies maycancel or curtail their drilling programs, thereby reducing demand for ourservices. Oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile historicallyand, we believe, will continue to be so in the future. Many factors beyond ourcontrol affect oil and natural gas prices, including: ·                  the cost ofexploring for, producing, and delivering oil and natural gas; ·                  the discoveryrate of new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  the rate ofdecline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves; ·                  availablepipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity; ·                  the ability ofoil and natural gas companies to raise capital; ·                  actions by OPEC(the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries); ·                  politicalinstability in the Middle East and other major oil and natural gas producingregions; ·                  economicconditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; 8 ·                  domestic andforeign tax policy; ·                  weatherconditions in the U.S. and elsewhere; ·                  the pace adoptedby foreign governments for the exploration, development, and production oftheir national reserves; ·                  the price offoreign imports of oil and natural gas; and ·                  the overallsupply and demand for oil and natural gas. Thehigh fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses. Companies within our industry are typically subject tohigh fixed costs which consist primarily of depreciation (a non-cash item) andmaintenance expenses associated with seismic data acquisition and equipment andcrew costs. In addition, ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, as well asnew equipment investment, can be significant. As a result, any extended periodsof significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weatherinterruptions, equipment failures, permit delays, or other causes couldadversely affect the results of our operations. Ouroperations are subject to delays related to obtaining land access rights of wayfrom third parties which could affect our results of operations. Our seismic data acquisition operations could beadversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage fromboth public and private land and/or mineral owners. Delays associated withobtaining such rights of way could negatively affect our results of operations. Ourindustry has recently experienced shortages in the availability of equipment.Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding equipment could adverselyaffect our business. We may not be able to acquire equipment to replace ourexisting equipment or add additional equipment. The high demand for theservices that we provide has decreased the supply of geophysical equipment, therebyresulting in extended delivery dates on orders of new equipment. Any delay inobtaining equipment could delay the implementation of additional crews andrestrict the productivity of our existing crews.  A delay in obtaining equipment essential toour operations could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Ourbusiness is subject to government regulation which may adversely affect ourfuture operations. Our operations are subject to a variety of federal,state, and local laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relatingto the protection of the environment and archeological sites. We are requiredto expend financial and managerial resources to comply with such laws andrelated permit requirements in our operations, and we anticipate that we willcontinue to be required to do so in the future. Although such expenditureshistorically have not been material to us, the fact that such laws orregulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost orimpact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The adoption oflaws and regulations that have the effect of reducing or curtailing explorationand development activities by energy companies could also adversely affect ouroperations by reducing the demand for our services. Risks Related To OurCommon Stock Ourcommon stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, price volatilityand low trading volume. Our stock price is subject to significant volatility.Overall market conditions including a decline in oil and natural gas prices, inaddition to other risks and uncertainties described in this Risk Factors
section and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, could cause the market price ofour common stock to fall. The high and low sales prices of our common stock forthe twelve months ended December 31, 2007, were $12.55 and $7.55,respectively. 9 Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Stock MarketLLC under the symbol TGE. However, daily trading volumes for our common stockare, and may continue to be, relatively small compared to many other publiclytraded securities. For example, since November 6, 2007, when we begantrading on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, our daily trading volume has been aslow as 2,800 shares.  In addition, ourcommon stock traded on the American Stock Exchange under the symbol TGE from April 18,2005 until November 5, 2007.  Duringthis period of time our daily trading volume was as low as 1,600 shares.  It may be difficult for you to sell yourshares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices, and theprice of our common stock may, therefore, be volatile. Ourofficers and directors own a large percentage of our common stock, and they mayexercise control over our business and affairs. Our officers and directors as a group beneficially ownapproximately 27.9% of our common stock. As a result, they will continue to beable to exercise significant influence, and in most cases control, over mattersrequiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, changes toour charter documents, and significant corporate transactions. Thisconcentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group ofholders of our common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed orthe direction of our business. The continued concentrated ownership of ourcommon stock will make it difficult for another company to acquire us and foryou to receive any related takeover premium for your shares (unless the controllinggroup approves the acquisition). Certainprovisions of our Restated Articles of Incorporation may make it difficult fora third party to acquire us or may adversely impact your rights as a commonshareholder. Our Restated Articles of Incorporation containprovisions that require the approval of holders of 80% of our issued andoutstanding shares before we can enter into a merger or other businesscombination or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Additionally, if weincrease the size of our board from the current six to nine directors, we couldbe required to stagger our directors terms, and our directors could not beremoved without approval of holders of 80% of our issued and outstandingshares. These provisions could discourage or impede a tender offer, proxycontest, or other similar transaction involving control of us. In addition, our board of directors has the right toissue preferred stock upon such terms and conditions as it deems to be in thebest interest of the Company. The terms of such preferred stock may adverselyimpact the dividend and liquidation rights of the common shareholders withoutthe approval of the common shareholders. Wedo not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeablefuture, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock willprovide a return to our shareholders. While there are currently no restrictions prohibitingus from paying dividends to our shareholders, we have not paid any cashdividends on our common stock in the past, and we do not anticipate paying anydividends in the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in thefuture, however, is in the discretion of our board of directors and will dependon our financial condition, results of operations, capital and legalrequirements, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.Earnings, if any, are expected to be retained to fund our future operations. "
