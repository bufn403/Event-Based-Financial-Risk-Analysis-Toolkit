"" --> ITEM 1A.  Risk    Factors     Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of    factors, many of which are not within our control. Although we    have tried to discuss key risk factors below, please be aware    that other risks may prove to be important in the future. These    factors include the following: We are    subject to regulation by each state in which we operate that    affect our operations and financial results.     Our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and    storage businesses are subject to various regulated returns on    our rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate. We    monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in    earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating    changes as we believe are needed. In addition, in the normal    course of the regulatory environment, assets may be placed in    service and historical test periods established before rate    cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our    returns. Once rate cases are filed, regulatory bodies have the    authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while    studying the cases. Because of this process, we must suffer the    negative financial effects of having placed assets in service    without the benefit of rate relief, which is commonly referred    to as regulatory lag. In addition, rate cases    involve a risk of rate reduction, because once rates have been    approved, they are still subject to challenge for their    reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities. Our debt    and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory    bodies in several states, which could limit our ability to take    advantage of favorable market conditions.     Our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives,    including the development of unbundling initiatives in the    natural gas industry. Unbundling is the separation of the    provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into    discrete components. It typically focuses on the separation of    the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting    opening of the regulated components of sales services to    alternative unregulated suppliers of those services. Although we    believe that our enhanced technology and distribution system    infrastructures have positively positioned us, we cannot provide    assurance that there would be no significant adverse effect on    our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the    natural gas distribution service business occur. Our    operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our    control which could adversely affect our financial    results.     Our risk management operations are subject to market risks    beyond our control including market liquidity, commodity price    volatility and counterparty creditworthiness.     Although we maintain a risk management policy, we may not be    able to completely offset the price risk associated with    volatile gas prices or the risk in our natural gas marketing and    pipeline and storage segments, which could lead to volatility in    our earnings. Physical trading also introduces price risk on any    net open positions at the end of each trading day, as well as    volatility resulting from    intra-day    fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price    movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for    future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is    hedged. Although we manage our business to maintain no    20Table of Contents    open positions, there are times when limited net open positions    related to our physical storage may occur on a short-term basis.    The determination of our net open position as of the end of any    particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to    future circumstances, including the use of gas by our customers    in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions.    Because the price risk associated with any net open position at    the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not    realized, we review these assumptions as part of our daily    monitoring activities. Net open positions may increase    volatility in our financial condition or results of operations    if market prices move in a significantly favorable or    unfavorable manner because the timing of the recognition of    profits or losses on the hedges for financial accounting    purposes usually do not match up with the timing of the economic    profits or losses on the item being hedged. This volatility may    occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or    losses, even though the expected profit margin is essentially    unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated.    Further, if the local physical markets in which we trade do not    move consistently with the NYMEX futures market, we could    experience increased volatility in the financial results of our    natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments.     Our natural gas marketing and pipeline, storage and other    segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of    natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed-price purchase or    sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through    the use of a variety of financial derivatives. However,    contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to    withdraw gas from storage, which could cause us to purchase gas    at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes    to fulfill customer contracts. We could also realize financial    losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in    the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a    counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In addition,    adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties    could limit the level of trading activities with these parties    and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a    contract.     We are also subject to interest rate risk on our commercial    paper borrowings. In recent years, we have been operating in a    relatively low interest-rate environment with both short and    long-term interest rates being relatively low compared to    historical interest rates. However, in the last three years, the    Federal Reserve has taken actions that have generally resulted    in increases in short-term interest rates. Future increases in    interest rates could adversely affect our future financial    results. The    concentration of our distribution, pipeline and storage    operations in the State of Texas has increased the exposure of    our operations and financial results to economic conditions and    regulatory decisions in Texas.     As a result of our acquisition of the distribution, pipeline and    storage operations of TXU Gas in October 2004, over    50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and    most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are    located in the State of Texas. This concentration of our    business in Texas means that our operations and financial    results are subject to greater impact than before from changes    in the Texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by    state and local regulatory authorities. Adverse    weather conditions could affect our operations.     Beginning in the    2006-2007    winter heating season, we have had weather-normalized rates for    over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters,    which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of    warmer-than-normal weather for meters in those service areas.    However, our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission    and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with    the actual temperatures during the winter heating season. In    addition, sustained cold weather could adversely affect our    natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to    purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain    sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts. The    execution of our business plan could be affected by an inability    to access capital markets.     We rely upon access to both short-term and long-term capital    markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Adverse changes    in the economy or these markets, the overall health of the    industries in which we    21Table of Contents    operate and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to    these markets, increase our cost of capital or restrict the    execution of our business plan.     Our long-term debt is currently rated as investment    grade by Standard & Poors Corporation    (S&P), Moodys Investors Services, Inc. (Moodys)    and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch), the three credit rating    agencies that rate our long-term debt securities. There can be    no assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment    grade ratings for our long-term debt. If we were to lose our    investment-grade rating, the commercial paper markets and the    commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us.    This would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and    reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate. In    addition, if our commercial paper ratings were lowered, it would    increase the cost of commercial paper financing and could reduce    or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets.    If we were unable to issue commercial paper at reasonable rates,    we would likely borrow under our bank credit facilities to meet    our working capital needs, which would likely increase the cost    of our working capital financing. Inflation    and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base    and customer collections and increase our level of    indebtedness.     Inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses    and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs. We have    a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our    natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing    cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in    adjusting those gas rates. Historically, we have been able to    budget and control operating expenses and investments within the    amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to    continue to do so. However, the ability to control expenses is    an important factor that could influence future results.     Rapid increases in the price of purchased gas, which has    occurred in recent years, cause us to experience a significant    increase in short-term debt. We must pay suppliers for gas when    it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when    these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly    customer bills for gas delivered. Increases in purchased gas    costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts    as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas    bills, leading to higher than normal accounts receivable. This    could result in higher short-term debt levels, greater    collection efforts and increased bad debt expense. Our    growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our    business, which requires extensive capital    spending.     We must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas    distribution system to maintain the growth in the number of our    customers. The cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a    number of factors, including the general state of the economy    and weather. Our cash flows from operations generally are    sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures    including the financing of the costs of new construction along    with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing    natural gas system. Due to the timing of these cash flows and    capital expenditures, we often must fund at least a portion of    these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders,    the cost of which is dependent on the interest rates at the    time. This in turn may limit our ability to connect new    customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of    funds we can invest in our infrastructure. Our    operations are subject to increased competition.     In the residential and commercial customer markets, our natural    gas distribution operations compete with other energy products,    such as electricity and propane. Our primary product competition    is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking.    Increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact    our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of    natural gas to the consumer. This could adversely impact our    business if as a result, our customer growth slows, reducing our    ability to make capital expenditures, or if our customers    further conserve their use of gas, resulting in reduced gas    purchases and customer billings.    22Table of Contents    In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing    plants and agricultural customers, adverse economic conditions,    including higher gas costs, could cause these customers to use    alternative sources of energy, such as electricity, or bypass    our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower    per-unit    costs. Our regulated transmission and storage operations    currently face limited competition from other existing    intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or    arrange transportation, storage and other services for    customers. However, competition may increase if new intrastate    pipelines are constructed near our existing facilities. The    cost of providing pension and postretirement health care    benefits is subject to changes in pension fund values, changing    demographics and actuarial assumptions and may have a material    adverse effect on our financial results.     We provide a cash-balance pension plan and postretirement    healthcare benefits to eligible full-time employees. Our costs    of providing such benefits is subject to changes in the market    value of our pension fund assets, changing demographics,    including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an    expected increase in the number of eligible former employees    over the next five to ten years, and various actuarial    calculations and assumptions. The actuarial assumptions used may    differ materially from actual results due to changing market and    economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates and    interest rates and other factors. These differences may result    in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense or    other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods. We are    subject to environmental regulations which could adversely    affect our operations or financial results.     We are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements    enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental    authorities relating to protection of the environment and health    and safety matters, including those legal requirements that    govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the    management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the    clean-up of    contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant    and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to    employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also    requires that our facilities, sites and other properties    associated with our operations be operated, maintained,    abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable    regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with these laws,    regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines,    penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be    significant to our financial results. In addition, existing    environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may    become subject to new regulations. Such revised or new    regulations could result in increased compliance costs or    additional operating restrictions which could adversely affect    our business, financial condition and results of operations. Distributing    and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in    accidents and additional operating costs.     Our natural gas distribution business involves a number of    hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided,    such as leaks, accidents and operational problems, which could    cause loss of human life, as well as substantial financial    losses resulting from property damage, damage to the environment    and to our operations. We do have liability and property    insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks.    However, because our pipeline, storage and distribution    facilities are near or are in populated areas, any loss of human    life or adverse financial results resulting from such events    could be large. If these events were not fully covered by    insurance, our financial position and results of operations    could be adversely affected. Natural    disasters, terrorist activities or other significant events    could adversely affect our operations or financial    results.     Natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and    operations. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities    could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in    the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Also,    companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure    to actual acts of terrorism, which could subject our operations    to increased risks. As a result, the availability of insurance    23Table of Contents    covering such risks may be more limited, which could increase    the risk that an event could adversely affect future financial    results"
