CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric, CERC and SIGECO. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10-K, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company and the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s businesses. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this combined report on Form 10-K, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings” in Item 7, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in this Item 1A. Carefully consider each of the risks described below, including those relating to Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined report on Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its subsidiaries. 18Risk Factors
 Affecting OperationsElectric Generation, Transmission and Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Disruptions at power generation facilities, generation inadequacy or directives issued by regulatory authorities could cause interruptions in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to provide transmission and distribution services and adversely affect their reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Houston Electric owns the transmission and distribution infrastructure in its service territory that delivers electric power to its customers, but it does not own or operate any power generation facilities, except for its operation of TEEEF. Indiana Electric owns and operates power generation facilities in addition to the transmission and distribution infrastructure in its service territory. Both Houston Electric and Indiana Electric must follow the directives issued by their respective independent system operator, ERCOT and MISO, respectively. ERCOT and MISO have and may in the future issue directives requiring members to implement controlled outages as a result of an emergency or reliability issues, and Houston Electric has faced and may in the future face challenges to their planning and preparation for such directives and their implementation of Load Shed, including, for example, allegations that they had discretion as to how to shed load and which customers experienced outages and the duration of those outages. As a result, claims and lawsuits could be filed against Houston Electric and Indiana Electric for personal injury, property damage or other damage or loss as a result of their respective Load Shed planning, preparation, implementation, and decisions in order to meet the directives of ERCOT and MISO, respectively. For example, in February 2021, the ERCOT regulated Texas electric system experienced extreme winter weather conditions and an unprecedented power generation shortage. The amount of electricity generated by the state’s power generation companies was insufficient to meet the amount demanded by customers. This resulted in ERCOT directing TDUs to significantly Load Shed, which caused customer outages across the ERCOT electric grid of Texas, including in Houston Electric’s service territory. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and “— Houston Electric’s use of TEEEF ...” for further information. If power generation capacity is severely disrupted or is inadequate for any reason in the future, Houston Electric’s or Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted. Further, as with the lawsuits filed in the aftermath of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, claims and lawsuits could be filed against the Registrants, and our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Additionally, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities and the generating facilities that supply the power transmitted by Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are subject to operational risks that have and may in the future result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased purchase power costs. For example, in June 2022, Culley 3, a coal-fired generation unit, experienced a boiler feed pump turbine failure that caused the unit to be out of service for nearly nine months. In this time frame, CenterPoint Energy purchased energy on the open market and those purchases are currently being challenged at the IURC by multiple intervenors. Such open market purchases have and may again result in increased costs and have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, Indiana Electric is party to a number of PPAs with third parties. Indiana Electric’s power generation may be disrupted or otherwise insufficient if third parties do not deliver required power under our PPAs. These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns or malfunctions due to equipment failure or operator error; aging infrastructure; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire and inflation rises; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; or natural disasters, all of which could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s and Houston Electric’s businesses. Further, Indiana Electric currently relies on coal for the majority of its generation capacity. Indiana Electric purchases the majority of its coal supply from a single, unrelated party and, although the coal supply is under long-term contract, the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect its ability to deliver electricity to its customers and adversely impact Indiana Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In 2021 and part of 2022, Indiana Electric experienced coal supply shortages due to labor shortages that the coal industry experienced. While the coal supply shortage that Indiana Electric experienced did not impact its ability to deliver electricity to its customers, labor shortages as well as supply shortages in the future, whether caused by insufficient supply or supplier bankruptcy or other regulatory and supply issues in the mining industry, may lead to increased cost and have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See “— Disruptions to the global supply...” As Indiana Electric continues its generation transition and more renewable energy sources come online, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities may experience unanticipated disruptions as a result of renewable supply shortages, including, but not limited to, due to cloudy or windless days. Additionally, such disruptions could adversely affect its ability to deliver electricity to its customers and adversely impact Indiana Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The operations of Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are subject to the usual hazards associated with high-voltage electricity transmission, including inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, contact with electrified facilities by people, equipment, and debris, unscheduled downtime, equipment interruptions, contamination, remediation, explosions, fires, 19chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances, and other environmental risks. Such hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and environmental damage, and may result in suspension of operations, disruption of service to customers, and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric maintain property and casualty insurance but are not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to their businesses.Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payments of these receivables could adversely affect Houston Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity. As of December 31, 2023, Houston Electric provided electric delivery service to approximately 65 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event or other extreme weather (which may result in abnormal power prices), structural problems in the market served by ERCOT, mismanagement by the REPs, inflation or financial difficulties of one or more REPs, have and may in the future impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms to otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments relating to services provided prior to any shift to another REP or provider of last resort. Houston Electric’s PUCT-approved tariff outlines the remedies available to Houston Electric in the event that a REP defaults on amounts owed. Among the remedies available to Houston Electric are seeking recourse against any cash deposit, letter of credit, or surety bond provided by the REP or implementing mutually agreeable terms with the REP.  Another remedy is to require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort.  Houston Electric thus incurs risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2023 was $253 million. Approximately 39% and 20% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If a REP was unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made regarding prior payments Houston Electric had received from such REP. For example, following the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, multiple REPs filed for bankruptcy. We are currently capturing the amounts owed by these REPs as a permitted regulatory asset for bad debt expenses, which will be subject to a reasonableness review by the PUCT when we seek recovery in our next base rate case. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, as authorized by the PUCT, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric recorded a regulatory asset of $8 million for bad debt expenses resulting from REPs’ default on their obligation to pay delivery charges to Houston Electric net of collateral. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recover any or all of the regulatory asset in our next base rate case. See “— Rate regulation of Registrants’ Electric ...” Indiana Electric’s execution of its generation transition plan, including its IRP, is subject to various risks, including timely recovery of capital investments and increased costs and risks related to the timing and cost of development and/or construction of new generation facilities. Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP to the IURC every three years, unless extended, that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period. Indiana Electric has used past IRPs and will continue to use future IRPs to evaluate its mix of generation resources. Indiana Electric engages with the communities it serves, its regulators and third-parties in developing its generation transition plan. Recent IRPs have demonstrated Indiana Electric can most cost effectively serve its customers by transitioning its generation fleet to a wider mix of resources, including renewables. For example, Indiana Electric’s 2019/2020 IRP identified a preferred portfolio that retires 730 MW of coal-fired generation facilities and replaces these resources with a mix of generating resources composed primarily of renewables, including solar, wind, and solar with storage, supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation. Indiana Electric is continuing its plan to transition generation resources away from coal-fired generation to a more sustainable portfolio of resources, including renewables, and ultimately a goal to exit the coal plants that Indiana Electric operates by the end of 2027, as reflected in its most recent IRP submitted to the IURC in May 2023. While the IURC does not approve or reject Indiana Electric’s IRP, the IURC does comment on the IRP. Indiana Electric is required to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing or acquiring generating resources. Indiana Electric also obtains IURC approval of PPAs and DSM plans to ensure cost recovery. Indiana Electric must manage several risks associated with its generation transition plan. The IURC may delay providing comments on Indiana Electric’s most recent IRP, requiring Indiana Electric to either wait for comments or proceed to 20implement its IRP without IURC comments. The IURC comments may raise concerns with Indiana Electric’s IRP that make it difficult to obtain approval of the generation transition plan if not addressed. There is no guarantee that the IURC will approve Indiana Electric’s requests to implement part of its generation transition. If Indiana Electric fails to receive IURC approvals necessary to acquire the projects or resources identified in its IRP, Indiana Electric may not be able to implement its generation transition plan in a timely manner or at all. If Indiana Electric is unable to implement its generation transition plan, it may have an adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to execute on its net zero and carbon emission goals, its goal to exit the coal plants that Indiana Electric operates by the end of 2027, its growth strategy, achieve its financial goals, and otherwise impact results of operations and cash flows. Even if a generation project is approved, risks associated with the development or construction of any new generation exist, including new legislation restricting or delaying new generation, moratorium legislation, the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, scarcity of resources and labor, ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation, the effects of potential construction delays, project scope changes, and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements.  For example, the developers of a 130 MW Pike County Solar project have informed Indiana Electric that, due to delays in the MISO interconnection queue and inflationary pressures, costs have exceeded the agreed upon levels in the BTA. We and the developers are actively evaluating possible cost impacts to the project, which may lead to a refile for approval of the project with the IURC and further delay the completion of the project. If Indiana Electric is not able to reach a mutually acceptable solution with the developers of the Pike County Solar project, Indiana Electric may seek to terminate the project. For additional information, see “— Disruptions to the global supply...”  Furthermore, we have begun to acquire and/or develop additional solar and wind facilities as part of our capital plan. However, we have not yet entered into definitive agreements with developers for the acquisition and/or development of all of the additional projects, and we face significant competition with other bidders for a limited number of such generation facilities that developers plan to construct and for solar panels. For additional information, see “— Increases in the cost or reduction in supply ...” The number of available projects is further limited by the MISO interconnection queue due to potential interconnection costs that may render projects infeasible. As a result, suitable generation facility project candidates or resources necessary to construct such projects may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, or the expected benefits of a completed facility may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If Indiana Electric was unable to meet its generation needs as a result of project delays or cancellations it would be required to buy the necessary capacity and electricity on the open market. Such open market purchases may result in increased costs and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to complete or acquire such generation facilities or resources, or if they do not perform as anticipated, our future growth, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. Increases in the cost or reduction in supply of solar energy system components due to tariffs or trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.China is a major producer of solar panels and other solar products. Certain solar cells, modules, laminates and panels from China are subject to various antidumping and countervailing duty rates, depending on the exporter supplying the product, imposed by the U.S. government as a result of determinations the United States was materially injured as a result of such imports being sold at less than fair value and subsidized by the Chinese government. In March 2022, the DOC announced it would initiate an investigation into whether imports of solar cells and panels produced in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are circumventing U.S. rules and laws, such as antidumping and countervailing duty rates, which impose a tariff on imports of solar cells and panels manufactured in China. On August 18, 2023, the DOC announced its final determination that five of the eight companies investigated were attempting to bypass U.S. duties by doing minor processing in Southeast Asian countries before shipment to the United States. In addition, in December 2021, President Biden signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans goods from China’s Xinjiang region due to the use of forced labor. Continuing tensions between the United States and China may lead to restrictions in trade between the two countries or new legislation, tariffs or bans, any of which could further negatively impact the supply of solar panels. These or similar duties and legislation have and may in the future also put upward pressure on prices of these solar energy products, which may reduce our ability to acquire these items in a timely and cost-efficient manner. If we or the developers we are working with are unable to secure such solar energy products in a timely and cost-efficient manner, we may be forced to delay, downsize and/or cancel solar projects and we may not be able to procure the resources needed to fully execute on our ten-year capital plan or achieve our net zero emissions goals. We have experienced project delays due to developers of our projects being unable to acquire solar panels due to supply chain constraints. Additionally, delays or cancellations by developers of third-party solar power facilities expected to interconnect with CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s system may have adverse impacts, such as delayed or reduced potential future revenues. We cannot predict what additional actions the U.S. government may adopt with respect to tariffs or other trade regulations in the future or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation for such measures. If the DOC imposes tariffs on solar panels as a result of its findings or other additional measures are imposed, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.21The occurrence of extreme weather events, including winter storms and record hot temperatures, or other causes could lead to additional reforms to the Texas electric market, some measure of which, if implemented, could have an adverse impact on Houston Electric.During and in the aftermath of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, the Texas legislature revised applicable statutes and granted the PUCT and ERCOT additional regulatory authority, both oversight and enforcement, that focuses on ensuring ERCOT market participants, including power generation facilities and TDUs (like Houston Electric), have adopted sufficient winterization standards and protection. Houston Electric believes it is in compliance with the requirements applicable to it. If any additional protections are required in the future as a result of additional extreme weather events or other causes, complying with these new protections may increase the cost of electricity, which could adversely affect Houston Electric’s results of operations. Any potential decreases in customer usage due to higher electricity prices charged by REPs may not result in increased base rates charged by Houston Electric for its services until its next general base rate proceeding. For further information on Houston Electric’s regulatory proceedings, see “— Rate regulation of Registrants’ Electric...”In addition, the PUCT and ERCOT continue to review the appropriate reliability standard and market design for the Texas electric market. There are uncertainties whether any further changes will result from these discussions or other efforts. If there are changes to how the Texas electric market is structured or regulated, such changes could have an adverse impact on Houston Electric’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.  Houston Electric’s use of TEEEF is subject to various risks, including failure to obtain and deploy sufficient TEEEF resources, potential performance issues and allegations about Houston Electric’s deployment of the resources (including the planning, execution, and effectiveness of the same), regulatory and environmental requirements, and timely recovery of capital. Following the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, the Texas legislature passed a law, effective September 1, 2021, that allows TDUs, such as Houston Electric, to lease and temporarily operate back-up generation resources during widespread power outages where ERCOT has ordered a TDU to Load Shed or the TDU’s distribution facilities are not being fully served by the bulk power system under normal operations. In response to this legislation, Houston Electric entered into two leases for TEEEF (mobile generation). In 2023, the Texas legislature amended the law to allow wider use of TEEEF. If Houston Electric is unable to deploy a sufficient number of TEEEF resources in time to respond to a particular event; if TEEEF resources fail to perform as intended; if Houston Electric is otherwise unable to provide back-up generation resources and restore power as intended; or if the use of TEEEF resources or their failure to perform causes or is alleged to cause any personal injury, property damage, or other damage or loss due to allegations Houston Electric failed to deploy such units reasonably or effectively and failed to respond to particular power outages, Houston Electric could be subject to claims, demands, litigation, liability, regulatory scrutiny, and loss of reputation.  While Houston Electric has insurance coverage and indemnity rights for its use of TEEEF resources, if its insurers or indemnitors fail to meet their indemnity obligations, Houston Electric could be liable for personal injury, property damage, or other damage or loss. As noted above, the legislation prescribes specific and limited use for TEEEF, and Houston Electric’s TEEEF have limited generation capacity, such that in future events customers could still be without power despite deployment of TEEEF resources. Further, TEEEF resources are subject to various environmental regulations and permitting requirements, which could have an impact on Houston Electric’s ability to use these units. If Houston Electric is not in compliance with any environmental regulation or permitting requirement, Houston Electric could be subject to further potential liability.  The use of TEEEF is also subject to various requirements, and failure to comply with them could subject Houston Electric to additional liability as well as challenges to its use of TEEEF in general. In April 2023, the PUCT approved revenue recovery of $39 million of TEEEF costs incurred in 2021, and in October 2023, an agreement with intervenors was reached with respect to Houston Electric’s second TEEEF filing for revenue recovery of $153 million ($114 million incremental to the prior filing) of TEEEF costs incurred through December 31, 2022, and the agreement was approved by PUCT in February 2024. Despite the recovery of these TEEEF costs in the past, there can be no assurances that Houston Electric will be able to recover future TEEEF costs. If Houston Electric is unable to recover any or all of its TEEEF costs our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. For further information, see “— Rate regulation of Registrants’ Electric...”, “— Our insurance coverage may not...” and “— We are subject to operational...”  22The impact of wildfires could negatively affect Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Wildfires have the potential to negatively affect communities within Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s service territories and the surrounding areas, as well as Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s vast network of electric transmission and distribution lines and facilities. The possibility of wildfires and the risk of damage to our network and facilities resulting therefrom may be exacerbated by severe weather events and the effects of climate change. For more information regarding climate related risks, see “ — Climate change could adversely impact ...” The continued expansion of the wildland-urban interface has also increased wildfire risk to communities in our service territories. While we proactively take steps to mitigate wildfire risk in the areas of our electrical assets, wildfire risk is always present. Houston Electric or Indiana Electric could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires or incur reputational harm if it was determined that they were caused by or enhanced due to any fault of Houston Electric or Indiana Electric. Wildfires could also lead to significant financial distress and further increased costs for wildfire insurance or lack of availability thereof. Furthermore, any damage caused to our assets, loss of service to our customers, or liability imposed as a result of wildfires could negatively impact Houston Electric’s or Indiana Electric’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.Natural Gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for Natural Gas’ customers.Natural Gas depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. Substantially all of Natural Gas’ natural gas supply is purchased on intrastate and interstate pipelines. If Natural Gas is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet Natural Gas’ requirements, the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in Natural Gas’ service territories could have an adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather conditions, wildfires, acts of terrorism, human error or cyberattacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, could also adversely affect Natural Gas’ businesses. Further, to the extent that Natural Gas’ natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then Natural Gas’ operations could be negatively affected. Natural Gas is subject to fluctuations in natural gas prices, which could affect the ability of its suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or may impact its operations, which could adversely affect CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Natural Gas is subject to risk associated with changes in the price of natural gas. Significant increases in natural gas prices, such as those experienced during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, might affect Natural Gas’ ability to collect balances due from customers and could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which Natural Gas operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that Natural Gas’ suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Natural Gas must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas delivered and have an adverse impact on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Natural Gas competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and natural gas marketers also compete directly with Natural Gas for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass Natural Gas’ facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas delivered by Natural Gas as a result of competition with alternate energy sources may have an adverse impact on CenterPoint Energy and CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.23Risk Factors
 Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal RisksRate regulation of Registrants’ Electric and Natural Gas businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully and timely recover their costs.The Registrants’ Electric and Natural Gas businesses are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions. Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) based on an analysis of their invested capital, their expenses and other factors in a designated test year (often either fully or partially historic), subject to periodic review and adjustments. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of the Registrants’ control. Indiana Electric and CERC each filed rate cases during 2023.  Houston Electric and CERC, with respect to its Ohio gas territory, each plan to file a rate case during 2024. The Registrants can make no assurance that their or their subsidiaries respective base rate proceedings will result in requested or favorable adjustments to their rates, in full and timely cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, the Registrants’ Electric and/or Natural Gas businesses to recover their investments below their requested levels, below the national average return for utilities or below recently approved return levels for other utilities in their respective jurisdictions. For instance, in the 2019 Houston Electric general rate case, Houston Electric filed a base rate case seeking approval for revenue increases of approximately $194 million and a 10.4% ROE, but after entering into a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement filed with the PUCT, Houston Electric received an overall revenue requirement increase of approximately $13 million and a 9.4% ROE. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow the Registrants to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, the Registrants or their subsidiaries might be required to implement additional measures, such as the adoption of ring-fencing measures by Houston Electric in connection with its 2019 rate case proceeding. Such additional measures may adversely impact the Registrants’ businesses and could have an adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The rates that Registrants’ Electric and Natural Gas businesses are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time, a situation referred to as “regulatory lag.” Regulatory lag has been and may be exaggerated in the future under certain circumstances, such as increasing inflation rates like those experienced in 2022 and continuing into 2023. For example, the MPUC ordered extraordinary gas costs incurred in the February 2021 Winter Storm Event be recovered over a 63-month period from 2022 — 2027 and CERC forego recovery of the associated carrying costs. Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by the Registrants and their subsidiaries to reduce the effects of regulatory lag (for example, CSIA, DCRF, DRR, DSMA, GRIP, RCRA, RRA, RSP, TCOS and TDSIC), such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval, which we cannot assure would be approved, and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce or otherwise impede the Registrants’ or their subsidiaries ability to adjust its rates or result in rates below those requested. Therefore, the Registrants can make no assurance filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery.  Further, from time to time, the Registrants’ regulators approve the issuance of securitization bonds in order to recover certain costs, including costs incurred as a result of severe weather or to recover stranded asset costs. The issuance of these securitization bonds may be delayed. If the issuance of securitization bonds is delayed, we may not be able to recover our costs in a timely manner, which could have an adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy’s, CERC’s, and Houston Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk jurisdictional regulatory authorities may challenge the reasonableness or prudency of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by the Registrants or their subsidiaries and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates. From time to time, these reviews and investigations have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, the Registrants’ to recover their costs or investments below their requested levels.  For example, in October 2022, the MPUC issued a written order disallowing recovery of approximately $36 million of the $409 million originally requested by CERC in connection with its recovery of costs incurred as a result of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event.  Notwithstanding the application of such rate adjustment mechanisms, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of legislative processes or rulemakings, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of the Registrants’ or their subsidiaries’ costs or enable them to earn their authorized return. Changes to the rate case or interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact the Registrants’ ability to recover their costs in a timely manner. Additionally, decisions from regulators are typically subject to appeal, and any such appeal could further exacerbate regulatory lag and lead to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow the Registrants to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For further information on rate case proceedings and interim rate adjustment mechanisms, see 24“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.  We face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, governmental approvals, public opposition,  and the negotiation of project development agreements that may impede our development and operating activities. Houston Electric, Indiana Electric and CERC own, develop, construct, manage and operate electric generation, transmission and distribution facilities or natural gas distribution facilities, as applicable. A key component of our growth is our ability to construct and operate these facilities. As part of these operations, we must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various local, state, federal and other regulatory authorities and abide by their respective conditions. We have previously experienced delays in receiving approval with regards to certain permits and licenses, and have had investigations and enforcement actions with regards to certain of our projects, which have caused delays to our projects in the past. Should we in the future be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits on acceptable terms or resolving third-party challenges to such licenses or permits, should there be a delay in obtaining or renewing necessary licenses or permits, or should regulatory authorities initiate any associated investigations or enforcement actions or impose related penalties or disallowances, our future net income and cash flows could be reduced and our financial condition could be impacted. Any failure to negotiate successful project development agreements for new facilities with third parties could also have adverse effects. Additionally, our projects have faced and may in the future face opposition from individuals, community organizations, environmental and other activist groups, and other public-interest entities.We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations, including regulation of CCR, climate change legislation and certain local initiatives that seek to limit fossil fuel usage.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric generating facilities and electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, including among others, restricting the use of fossil fuels through future climate legislation or regulation, restricting the use of natural gas-fired appliances in new homes, limiting airborne emissions from generating facilities, restricting the way we manage wastes, including wastewater discharges, air emissions and CCR removal, and requiring remedial action or monitoring to mitigate environmental actions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. We may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to comply with these requirements. Further, in the course of operations we have released, and may in the future inadvertently release, various contaminants. Any such releases could have a significant impact on the environment and result in significant fines. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, which we have been subject to from time to time, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean, restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.Regulatory agencies have also adopted, and from time to time consider adopting, new legislation and/or modifying existing laws and regulations to reduce GHGs. There continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the possible means for their regulation. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment. On April 22, 2021, President Biden announced new goals of 50% reduction of economy-wide GHG emissions and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035, which formed the basis of the United States’ commitments announced in Glasgow, Scotland. These renewed climate commitments coming out of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Glasgow and President Biden’s executive orders have resulted in the development of additional regulations and changes to existing regulations. For example, in May 2023, the EPA proposed regulations setting new GHG emission reduction targets for coal and gas-fired electric generating units that could potentially require additional operating costs or operating restrictions related to operation of Indiana Electric’s natural-gas fired units. The administration is expected to finalize additional GHG regulations and mandated financial, emissions and other disclosures. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas and electricity, and a generator of electricity in Indiana, the Registrants’ revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or that would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas or electricity or prevent the use of certain fuel types. Also, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and 25cash flows. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services. For further discussion, see “Business—Environmental Matters” in Item 1 and “ —Natural Gas must compete with…”Evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s electric generation and natural gas businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric’s current generating units substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions may choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy’s financing arrangements until future coal generation closures satisfy their thresholds for investments. Further, some investors choose to not invest in CenterPoint Energy due to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s use of fossil fuels. Also, certain cities in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas operational footprint have discussed the adoption of initiatives to prohibit the construction of new natural gas facilities that would provide service and focus on electrification. For example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil natural gas. Certain state and local governments have also passed, or are considering, legislation banning the use of natural gas-fired appliances in new homes, which could affect consumer use of natural gas. Should such bans be enacted within Natural Gas’ operational footprint, they could adversely affect consumer demand for natural gas. Any such initiatives and legislation could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s results of operations. Further, investors, lenders, regulators and other stakeholders are focusing on issues related to environmental justice, which may result in increased scrutiny of our applicable regulatory processes and additional costs of compliance or may adversely affect our reputation. This focus on environmental justice matters at the federal and state levels may also provide communities opposed to our operations with greater opportunities to challenge or delay our projects. Opposition to our projects or successful challenges or appeals to permits issued for our projects could result in cancellation of such projects and the loss of investments we have made with respect thereto. CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities associated with the implementation of and efforts to achieve its carbon emissions reduction goals.In September 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its net zero emission goals for Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 and a 20-30% reduction in certain Scope 3 emissions by 2035 as compared to 2021 levels. CenterPoint Energy’s analysis and plan for execution requires it to make a number of assumptions. These goals and underlying assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees. Should one or more of CenterPoint Energy’s underlying assumptions prove incorrect, its actual results and ability to achieve net zero emissions by 2035 could differ materially from its expectations. Certain of the assumptions that could impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its net zero emissions goals include, but are not limited to: emission levels, service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with expectations; regulatory approvals related to Indiana Electric’s generation transition plan; customer demand for carbon free energy; impacts of future environmental regulations or legislation; impacts of future carbon pricing regulation or legislation, including a future carbon tax; price, availability and regulation of carbon offsets; price of fuel, such as natural gas; cost of energy generation technologies, such as wind and solar, natural gas and storage solutions; adoption of alternative energy by the public, including adoption of electric vehicles; rate of technology innovation with regards to alternative energy resources; CenterPoint Energy’s ability to implement its modernization plans for its pipelines and facilities; the ability to complete and timely implement generation alternatives, such as solar and wind generation, to Indiana Electric’s coal generation and retirement dates of Indiana Electric’s coal facilities by 2035; the ability to construct and/or permit new natural gas pipelines; the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, the lack of or scarcity of resources and labor, any project cancellations, construction delays or overruns and the ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation; impact of any supply chain disruptions; changes in applicable standards or methodologies; and enhancement of energy efficiencies. Our businesses may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives we announce, our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them, and related disclosures. If our sustainability practices do not align with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.Developing and implementing plans for compliance with voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. To the extent that we believe any of these costs are recoverable in rates, cost recovery could be resisted by our regulators and our regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Moreover, we cannot predict 26the ultimate impact of achieving our emissions reduction goals, or the various implementation aspects, on our system reliability or our financial condition and results of operations.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, as a member of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, could be subject to higher costs for system improvements, as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of FERC mandatory reliability standards.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions. As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems. In addition, FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO, respectively. FERC has designated NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. FERC has approved the delegation by NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation, and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a Delaware non-profit corporation. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures, which may not be fully recoverable in rates. While Houston Electric and Indiana Electric have received minor fines in the past for noncompliance, if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards again, they would be subject to sanctions, including potential monetary penalties, which could range as high as over a million dollars per violation per day, and non-monetary penalties, such as having to file a mitigation plan to prevent recurrence of a similar violation and having certain milestones in such plan tracked.We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, including lawsuits and environmental matters in addition to regulatory proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties; recent trends have shown jury verdicts, settlements and other liability have been significantly increasing; and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Additionally, under some circumstances, the Registrants could potentially have claims filed against them or incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them as a result of sales, divestitures or other transfers to third parties who may be unable to fulfill their indemnity obligations to the Registrants. Final resolution of these matters, or any potential future claims or liabilities, may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial results.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, including as part of our Ethics and Compliance program’s efforts to detect misconduct, we become aware of and expect to continue to become aware of instances of employee misconduct, which we investigate, remediate and disclose as appropriate and proportionate to the incident.Risk Factors
 Affecting Financial, Economic and Market RisksDisruptions to the global supply chain may lead to higher prices for goods and services and impact our operations, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our capital plan and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The global supply chain has experienced disruptions due to a multitude of factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages, resource availability, long lead time, delivery delays, inflation, severe weather events and disruptions to internal or international shipping, including as a result of armed conflicts, and these disruptions have adversely impacted the utility industry. We, as well as other companies in our industry, have experienced supply chain disruptions, as well as increased prices, 27and we may continue to experience this in the future. Examples of materials necessary for the transmission and distribution of power we and our industry have experienced difficulties in procuring include transformers, wires, cables, meters, poles and solar panels. If the supply chain disruption persists or worsens, we may experience difficulties in procuring these resources and others necessary to operate our businesses in the future. As a result, we may not be able to procure the resources, including labor, needed to timely perform storm restoration activities, fully execute on our ten-year capital plan and/or achieve our net zero emission and carbon emissions reduction goals. Moreover, high inflation and persistent high interest rates continue to be an area of economic concern and has contributed to the increased prices for materials and services that have been experienced by us and other companies in our industry. Even if we are able to procure the necessary resources, we might not be able to do so at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner which could result in project cancellations or scope changes, delays, cost overruns and under-recovery of costs. If we are unable to fully execute on capital plans as a result of supply chain disruptions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that derives all of its operating income from, and holds substantially all of its assets through, its subsidiaries. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions. CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from, and holds substantially all of its assets through, its subsidiaries. Similarly, as a result of the Restructuring, CERC derives a significant portion of its operating income from and holds a significant portion of its assets through its subsidiaries, including Indiana Gas and VEDO. As a result, CenterPoint Energy and to a lesser extent, CERC, depend on the performance of and distributions from their respective subsidiaries to meet their respective payment obligations and to pay dividends on their respective common stock.  In general, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide them with funds for their respective payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s respective subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy or CERC, and their respective subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make payments or other distributions. Further, as part of Houston Electric’s 2019 base rate case, Houston Electric agreed to certain “ring-fencing” measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy. Houston Electric is expected to file a base rate proceeding in 2024. In this proceeding, Houston Electric may be requested to institute further ring-fencing measures or further ring-fencing measures could be imposed on Houston Electric in the future through legislation or PUCT rules or orders. While current ring-fencing measures have not impacted Houston Electric’s ability to pay dividends to CenterPoint Energy, the imposition of any additional measures impacting CenterPoint Energy’s ability to receive dividends from Houston Electric could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. Any such adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy could also adversely affect Houston Electric’s and/or CERC’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations as CenterPoint Energy may not be able to financially support Houston Electric and/or CERC if and when necessary. CenterPoint Energy’s right to receive assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, are structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would likely be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any senior indebtedness of the subsidiary.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive, and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures. For example, we depend on (i) long-term debt, (ii) borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and, for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, commercial paper programs and (iii) if market conditions permit, issuances of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy. We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures. Additionally, from time to time, our operating subsidiaries, including Houston Electric and CERC, may rely on intercompany borrowings from CenterPoint Energy that may be sourced from CenterPoint Energy’s external financings. As of December 31, 2023, CenterPoint Energy had $19 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $502 million of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. For information on outstanding indebtedness of CenterPoint Energy, Houston Electric and CERC as well as future maturities, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions, including inflation;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;28•the future performance of our businesses;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•actions from the Federal Reserve, including changes in interest rates and unanticipated actions; •market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•investor willingness to invest in companies associated with fossil fuels; •our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms; •timing of future securitizations by jurisdictions in which we operate; and•provisions of relevant securities laws.The Registrants’ current credit ratings and any changes in credit ratings in 2023 and to date in 2024 are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be reduced or withdrawn by a rating agency. The Registrants note these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold their securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have an adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms. For example, if CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it may have an adverse impact on the cost of borrowings and, in extraordinary market conditions, it may limit the ability to access the debt capital markets. Additionally, CERC might be required to post collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. CenterPoint Energy’s previously owned Energy Systems Group business has performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by CenterPoint Energy. On June 30, 2023, CenterPoint Energy closed the sale of its Energy Systems Group business. Prior to June 30, 2023 and as part of the normal course of its business, Energy Systems Group issued performance bonds and other forms of assurance that committed it to operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations. As the parent company prior to the closing of the sale, CenterPoint Energy or Vectren guaranteed certain of its subsidiaries’ commitments. When Energy Systems Group was wholly owned by CenterPoint Energy, these guarantees did not represent incremental consolidated obligations, but rather, these guarantees represented guarantees of Energy Systems Group’s obligations to allow it to conduct business without posting other forms of assurance. Neither CenterPoint Energy nor Vectren has been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees to date, but may be required to do so in the future. For further information, see Note 15(c) to the consolidated financial statements. An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment could reduce our earnings.Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. While CenterPoint Energy has identified and recorded goodwill impairments in the past, no impairments to goodwill were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Should the annual goodwill impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity, increasing balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A non-cash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact its cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. CenterPoint Energy has approximately $828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31, 2023. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($18 million in the aggregate, or $1.24 per ZENS, as of December 31, 2023), or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  CenterPoint Energy’s ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS and ZENS-29Related Securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31, 2023, deferred taxes of approximately $728 million would have been payable in 2023, based on 2023 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2023 to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $81 million would have been payable in 2023. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. This could happen if CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop, the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities shares would typically be disposed when ZENS are exchanged and ZENS-Related Securities shares are sold.  Our potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend, in part, on our management’s ability to implement our business strategies successfully and realize the anticipated benefits therefrom. In 2021, we announced our strategic goals for CenterPoint Energy, including our ten-year capital plan, and net zero and carbon emission reductions goals. Our strategic goals are subject to the risks described in this section and various assumptions. These assumptions may be proven incorrect or we may not be able to execute on these strategic goals in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to execute on our strategic goals, including our ten-year capital plan, the benefits therefrom may not be fully realized, if at all, and our reputation may be adversely affected. From time to time we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, such as our proposed sale of our Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas local distribution companies, our completed sale of our Energy Systems Group business, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings, such as the Restructuring. However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions or dispositions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we are unable to make acquisitions, or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our future growth may be adversely affected. Further, any completed or future acquisitions or dispositions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; •acquisitions or dispositions, or the pursuit of such transactions, including any separation or disentanglement efforts or requirements, such as the provision of transition services, could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures; and•we may not receive regulatory approvals necessary to complete an acquisition or disposition in a timely manner or at all. On February 19, 2024, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the LAMS Asset Purchase Agreement to sell its Louisiana and Mississippi natural gas local distribution company businesses. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025. For further information, see Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.  We can make no assurances regarding the completion of this sale, which could be subject to delays or otherwise not consummated.Changing demographics, poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees. Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, contributions to the plan, the number of plan participants and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market 30value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations, or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In 2023, 2022 and 2021, CenterPoint Energy had a settlement expense for its pension plans as a result of an increase in eligible employee retirements and pension plan distributions.  See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.  In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements, these factors could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.We may be significantly affected by changes in federal income tax laws and regulations, including any comprehensive federal tax reform legislation.Our businesses are impacted by U.S. federal income tax policy. The TCJA, CARES Act, and the IRA significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, altering the expensing of capital expenditures, enacting a new CAMT, and expanding federal tax credits for cleaner energy production. Based on information and forecasts as of December 31, 2023, the Registrants will be subject to the CAMT included in the IRA.The interpretive guidance issued by the IRS and state tax authorities may be inconsistent with our interpretation and the legislation could be subject to amendments, which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. In addition, the retail regulatory treatment of the expanded tax credits and CAMT could impact the Registrants’ future cash flows, and this legislation could result in unintended consequences not yet identified that could have an adverse impact on the Registrants’ financial results and future cash flows. Further federal tax reform legislation could be enacted that may significantly change the federal income tax laws applicable to domestic businesses, including changes that may increase the federal income tax rate and impact investment incentives and deductions for depreciation and interest, among other deductions. While CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries cannot assess the overall impact of any such potential legislation on our businesses, it is possible that our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, with any enacted federal tax reform legislation, it is uncertain how state commissions and local municipalities may require us to respond to the effects of such tax legislation, including determining the treatment of EDIT and other increases and decreases in our revenue requirements. As such, potential regulatory actions in response to any enacted tax legislation could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting Safety and Security RisksThe Registrants’ businesses have safety risks. The Registrants’ facilities and distribution and transmission systems have been and may in the future be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public. Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, claims and litigation, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory authorities or other public authorities. Further, certain CenterPoint Energy employees who work in the field have experienced threats of violence during the performance of their work. Threats of violence, actual violence and other concerns may result in field employees being unable or unwilling to complete critical functions, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations, and could make it harder to recruit and retain certain employees. Cyberattacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to our information technology systems, operational technology, network infrastructure, and other technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our businesses. For example, the operation of our electric generation, transmission and distribution systems are dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our systems and third-party systems. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of the intelligent grid, smart devices and operational technologies across our businesses. Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyberattack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems. Similarly, our business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. For example, the operation of an efficient deregulated wholesale and retail electric market in Texas mandates communication with ERCOT, and competitive retailers; and our Indiana Electric organization has a similar relationship with MISO. Also, the distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with third-party 31systems. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by man-made events, such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability to conduct operations and control assets.The sophistication of cybersecurity threats, including those leveraging AI, continues to increase, and the controls and preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cybersecurity incidents and protect our systems, including the regular testing of our cybersecurity incident response plan, may be insufficient. In addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency, such as our use of AI, may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cybersecurity incidents. Cyberattacks, including phishing attacks and threats from the use of malware, ransomware and viruses or malicious code, and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, impact our customers, increase costs and subject us to possible legal claims and liability. While we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology, operational technology, and data systems from such attacks, our cybersecurity program does not prevent all breaches or cyberattack incidents. We have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber intrusions and attacks to our information systems and those of third parties, including vendors, suppliers, contractors and quasi government entities who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information. These prior intrusions and attacks have not had a material impact on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Because technology is increasingly complex and cyberattacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there is a risk such incidents could have an adverse effect on us in the future. The risk of a disruption or breach of our operational technology systems, or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations, through a cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack, has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world. We are not fully insured against all cybersecurity risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We depend on the secure operations of our physical assets to transport the energy we deliver and our information technology to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information and operational technology we use to safely operate our energy transportation systems. Security breaches, attacks on our infrastructure and facilities, including against the Registrants or as a means to harm a third-party by disrupting the transmission and distribution of energy, or acts of terrorism, including by foreign or domestic actors, could expose our business to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of critical physical assets or information and functions that affect our operations, as well as potential data privacy breaches and loss of protected personal information and other sensitive information, such as Critical Energy Infrastructure Information. Such losses could result in operational impacts, damage to our assets, public or personal safety incidents, impacts to our customers, damage to the environment, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation and a potential adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There is no certainty that costs incurred related to actual or thwarted cyberattacks, or for the safeguarding against such security threats, will be recoverable through rates. Compliance with and changes in cybersecurity laws and regulations have a cost and operational impact on our business, and failure to comply with such requirements could adversely impact our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, and U.S. government warnings have indicated infrastructure assets, including pipelines and electric generation and infrastructure, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. The TSA announced two new security directives in the second and third quarters of 2021. These directives required critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements. In the third quarter of 2022, the TSA made significant updates to one of the security directives to require critical pipeline owners to establish and implement a TSA-approved Cybersecurity Implementation Plan, develop and maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, and establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Plan. The TSA approved CenterPoint Energy’s Cybersecurity Implementation Plan in December 2022. The TSA further updated and renewed the pipeline security directive in July 2023 with updated requirements for Pipeline Cybersecurity Mitigation Actions, Contingency Planning, and Testing. CenterPoint Energy continues to take measures to comply with the TSA pipeline security directive requirements. We may be required to expend significant additional resources and costs to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. There is no certainty that such costs incurred will be recovered through rates. Any failure to remain in compliance with these government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.32Failure to maintain the security of personal information could adversely affect us.In connection with our businesses, we and our third parties (vendors, suppliers, and contractors) collect and retain personal information (for example, information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy continues to evolve and is increasingly demanding. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. While we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology, operational technology, and data systems from attacks, and while we have implemented and maintain a data privacy program designed to manage and protect personal information, neither program can prevent all security or privacy breaches. We and some of our third parties that maintain personal information have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, data privacy incidents and breaches; however, to date, we have not experienced a material data privacy incident or breach. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personal information we maintain, or failure of our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions and other legal requirements, could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection privacy, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.We may not be successful in our adoption of AI, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.We are using and exploring the further use of AI, including generative AI, and its ability to enhance the services we offer to the communities we serve. There are significant risks involved in developing and deploying AI, and there can be no assurance that the use of AI will enhance our services or be beneficial to our business, including with respect to the efficiency and resiliency of our systems. For example, our AI-related efforts may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, discrimination, toxicity, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, and cybersecurity, among others. In addition, the adoption of AI may subject us to new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, new or amended laws, rules, directives, and regulations governing the use of AI, litigation, ethical concerns, negative consumer perceptions as to automation and AI, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. We may not be able to recover our investments in AI technology through our regulatory proceedings, and our use of AI may subject us to legal liability. Similarly, as AI continues to evolve we may not be able to adopt and implement AI as quickly as our customers or communities desire or regulators may require, which could also adversely affect us. AI is a relatively new and rapidly evolving technology, and we are unable to predict all of the risks that may result from the adoption of our AI initiatives.General and Other RisksOur revenues and results of operations are seasonal.Houston Electric’s, Indiana Electric’s and Natural Gas’ revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity and natural gas usage, as applicable. Houston Electric’s revenues are generally higher during the warmer months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electric’s results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as in certain past years, extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. A significant portion of Indiana Electric’s sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, as in certain past years, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather, while, as has occurred in certain past years, more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. Natural Gas’ revenues are customarily higher during the winter months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish Natural Gas’ results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as occurred in certain past years, extreme cold weather conditions could increase its results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. For information related to weather normalization regulatory mechanisms and weather hedges, see Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.33Climate change could adversely impact financial results from our businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events that could adversely affect our results of operations.A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories and our business. If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures than normal in our service territories, financial results from our businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, where natural gas is used to heat homes and businesses, warmer weather might result in less natural gas being used, adversely affecting us. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and severe winter weather conditions, including ice storms, all of which may impact our operations and ability to serve our customers. To the extent the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increases, our costs of providing service may increase, including the costs and availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and those costs may not be recoverable. Further, events of extreme weather could make it unsafe or hinder the effectiveness of our employees to fix, maintain and restore power to affected areas and could harm our reputation. Since certain of our facilities are located along or near the Texas gulf coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers. Our Electric and Natural Gas operations in our service territories were both also impacted by the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and could experience a similar event in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In the long term, climate change could also cause shifts in population, including customers moving away from our service territories. When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results are impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we are unable to recover those costs or recover in a timely manner, or if recovery of such costs results in higher rates and reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Similarly, public and private efforts to address climate change, such as by legislation, regulation, actions by private interest groups, and litigation, could impact our ability to continue operating our businesses as we do today, significant aspects of which rely on fossil fuels. These initiatives could have a significant impact on us and our operations as well as on our third-party suppliers, vendors and partners, which could impact us by among other things, causing permitting and construction delays, project cancellations or increased project costs passed on to us. For further information on these initiatives, please see “— We are subject to operational…” Finally, we may be subject to climate change litigation, which could result in substantial fines, penalties or damages and restrictions on our operations. The oil and gas industry has already faced such litigation, challenging its marketing and use of fossil fuels and attributing climate change to emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels, and other industries, including ours, could face such litigation in the future.  For more information, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, and “— CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks...” We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors such as changes in customers’ perceptions from incidents of other utilities.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic, climate and market conditions in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives, use of alternative technologies and changes in our customers’ perceptions regarding natural gas usage as a result of incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, bans on or further regulation of natural gas-fired appliances, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, including population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. Declines in demand for electricity and natural gas in our service territories due to pipeline incidents of other utilities, increased electricity and natural gas prices as experienced during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and during periods of persisting high inflation or economic downturns, among other factors, could reduce overall usage and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and natural gas. Although Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity delivered and used as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. A reduction in the rate of economic, employment and/or population growth could result in lower growth and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in such service territories. Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or natural gas or number of customers and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.34Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets, including the failure of equipment or processes and potential breakdowns due to such aging. The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs because of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs. As part of our long-term capital plan, we continue to make upgrades to our aging infrastructure assets to enhance the reliability of our infrastructure. Failure to achieve timely and full recovery of expenses associated with our aging infrastructure could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. In addition, the nature of information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Also, our ability to successfully maintain or replace our aging infrastructure may be delayed or be at a greater cost than anticipated due to supply chain disruptions. Further, with respect to Natural Gas’ operations, if certain pipeline replacements (for example, cast-iron or bare steel pipe) are not completed timely or successfully, government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires, explosions or leaks. Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, aging infrastructure may complicate our utility operations ability to address climate change concerns and efforts to enhance resiliency and reliability. See “— Disruptions to the global supply...” Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks inherent in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and in the delivery of natural gas that could result in substantial losses or other damages. From time to time, we have and may in the future experience various risks associated with the operations of our facilities, including, but not limited to, the following:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols for, among others, the transmission and distribution of electricity and in the delivery of natural gas, including operations of our peak shaving, propane-air facilities;•the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes;•information technology or financial and billing system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•compliance mandates that result in penalties from our regulators;•failure to obtain in a timely manner and at reasonable prices the necessary fuel, such as coal and natural gas, building materials or other items needed to operate our facilities;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, ice storms, flooding, terrorism, wildfires, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, including any environmental impacts related thereto, which catastrophic events may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such events have and may in the future result in the imposition of regulatory or environmental fines and increased litigation. 35Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change. We operate businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant investments and expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar, microturbines, fuel cells), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce energy consumption and waste. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, such as under the IRA, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, including Indiana Electric’s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Just as high inflation and rising interest rates, incentivize our customers to consume less energy, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner, to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.    Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We currently have insurance in place, such as general liability and property insurance, to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage premiums continue to increase, and insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to fully cover or restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Costs, damages and other liabilities related to recent events and incidents that affected other utilities, such as wildfires, winter storms and explosions, among other things, have exceeded or could exceed such utilities’ insurance coverage. Further, as a result of these recent events and incidents, the marketplace for insurance coverage to utility companies may be unavailable or limited in capacity or any such available coverage may be deemed by us to be cost prohibitive under current conditions. Insurance premiums for any such coverage, if available, may not be eligible for recovery, whether in full or in part, by us through the rates charged by our utility businesses.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and insurance capacity to be limited. Historically, Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise.  In the future, any such recovery may not be granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Global or regional health pandemics, epidemics or similar public health threats could negatively impact our business, outlook, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.Current and future health pandemics, epidemics and similar public health threats, such as COVID-19 and its variants, and the measures implemented to contain their spread, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines and vaccination mandates, continue to and may in the future have widespread impacts on the global economy, our employees, customers, and third-party business partners. The severity, magnitude and duration of a current or future health threat is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. Any future health threat, including the emergence of a new variant of COVID-19, could, in the future, impact our business in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, those outlined below:36•reduced demand from our commercial and industrial customers and shifts in demand for our services;•delayed service to customers because of shutdowns and/or illness and travel restrictions among our employees; •negative impacts to the financial condition of our customers and REPs and their ability to pay for our services, and our ability to disconnect service for non-payment may be limited, and state regulators may impose bill deferral programs; •potential limits or significant or entire curtailments of the ability of public utility commissions to approve or authorize applications and other requests we may make with respect to our businesses, including delaying rate making proceedings; •increased risk to our cybersecurity program as a result of an increase in cyberattacks during the pandemic and increased remote working arrangements, see above “Risks Affecting our Safety and Security Risks”; •increased rates of inflation and delays in our supply chain and our ability to complete maintenance, repairs, and capital programs, which could result in disruption, increased costs and our inability to execute on or require us to make modifications to our capital plan; and •accelerated employee turnover as a result of concerns regarding restrictions and guidelines, including mask mandates and quarantine mandates, and increased acceptability of alternative work arrangements.  Like many companies, we experienced the above and other impacts pursuant to the COVID-19 pandemic. These and other impacts of global or regional health pandemics, epidemics or similar public health threats could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section and the other reports we file from time to time with the SEC. We might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our operations, financial condition and liquidity. The ultimate impact of public health threats on our business depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain the spread and mitigate the public health effects. Any of these factors could have a negative impact on our business, outlook, financial condition and results of operations, which impact could be material. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. Further tightening of the labor market and increasing wages to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain good labor relations could adversely impact the operations of our facilities and our results of operations.Our businesses are dependent on recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. Like many companies in the utilities industry and other industries, we have experienced higher than normal turnover of employees as a result of a number of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, a tightening labor market, increasing remote working opportunities, employees shifting industries, individuals deciding not to work and a maturing workforce. Of our employee population, not including employees of Energy Systems Group prior to the divestiture on June 30, 2023 or temporary employees, 18.7%, 19.3% and 23.6% were retirement eligible as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our businesses, particularly the specialized skills and knowledge required to construct and operate generation facilities, a technology-enabled power grid and transmission and distribution infrastructure, among other facilities. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our ability to execute on our 10-year capital plan and our results of operations could be negatively affected.Furthermore, the operations of our facilities depend on good labor relations with our employees, and several of our businesses have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions, comprising approximately 40% of our workforce. We have several separate bargaining units, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described further in 37Note 8(j) to the consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. The collective bargaining agreements with Teamsters Local 135 related to SIGECO employees and Utility Workers Union of America, Local 175 related to VEDO employees are scheduled to expire in September 2024 and October 2024, respectively, and negotiations of these agreements are expected to be completed before the respective expirations. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and cash flows"
17,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2023-02-17,"Risk Factors
 CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric, CERC and SIGECO. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10-K, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company and the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s businesses. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this combined report on Form 10-K, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings” in Item 7, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in this Item 1A. Carefully consider each of the risks described below, including those relating to Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and 17specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined report on Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its subsidiaries. Risk Factors
 Affecting OperationsElectric Generation, Transmission and Distribution (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Disruptions at power generation facilities, generation inadequacy or directives issued by regulatory authorities could cause interruptions in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to provide transmission and distribution services and adversely affect their reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Houston Electric owns the transmission and distribution infrastructure in its service territory that delivers electric power to its customers, but it does not own or operate any power generation facilities, except for its operation of TEEEF. Indiana Electric owns and operates power generation facilities in addition to the transmission and distribution infrastructure in its service territory. Both Houston Electric and Indiana Electric must follow the directives issued by their respective independent system operator, ERCOT and MISO, respectively. ERCOT and MISO have and may in the future issue directives requiring members to implement controlled outages as a result of an emergency or reliability issues. For example, in February 2021, the ERCOT regulated Texas electric system experienced extreme winter weather conditions and an unprecedented power generation shortage. The amount of electricity generated by the state’s power generation companies was insufficient to meet the amount demanded by customers. This resulted in ERCOT directing TDUs to significantly Load Shed, which caused customer outages across the ERCOT electric grid of Texas, including in Houston Electric’s service territory. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements and “— Houston Electric’s use of temporary ...” for further information. If power generation capacity is severely disrupted or is inadequate for any reason in the future, Houston Electric’s or Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted. Further, as with the lawsuits filed in the aftermath of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, claims and lawsuits could be filed against the Registrants, and our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Additionally, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities and the generating facilities that supply the power transmitted by Houston Electric are subject to operational risks that have and may in the future result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased purchase power costs. For example, in December 2022, the A.B. Brown 1 and 2 generating units were offline at various times over an approximately week and a half period due to complications as a result of Winter Storm Elliott. If Indiana Electric is unable to meet its generation capacity it would be required to buy its energy on the open market, which is what occurred during Winter Storm Elliott when A.B. Brown 1 and 2 went offline. Such open market purchases may result in increased costs and may have an adverse impact on our operations. During the outage in Winter Storm Elliott, Indiana Electric had an increase in cost due to open market purchases because Indiana Electric would have been able to generate electricity at a lower rate than the costs incurred to purchase the electricity on the open market. Further, Indiana Electric is party to a number of PPAs with third parties. Indiana Electric’s power generation may be disrupted or otherwise insufficient if third parties do not deliver required power under our PPAs. These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns or malfunctions due to equipment failure or operator error; aging infrastructure; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire and inflation rates rise; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; or natural disasters, all of which could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s and Houston Electric’s business. Further, Indiana Electric currently relies on coal for the majority of its generation capacity. Indiana Electric purchases the majority of its coal supply from a single, unrelated party and, although the coal supply is under long-term contract, the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect its ability to deliver electricity to its customers and adversely impact Indiana Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In 2021 and part of 2022, Indiana Electric experienced coal supply shortages due to labor shortages that the coal industry is experiencing. While the coal supply shortage that Indiana Electric experienced did not impact its ability to deliver electricity to its customers, labor shortages as well as supply shortages in the future, whether caused by insufficient supply or supplier bankruptcy or other regulatory and supply issues in the mining industry, may lead to increased cost and have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See “— Continued disruptions to the supply...” Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payments of these receivables could adversely affect Houston Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity. As of December 31, 2022, Houston Electric provided electric delivery service to approximately 64 REPs. Adverse economic 18conditions, such as the impact of COVID-19, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT, inflation or financial difficulties of one or more REPs have and may in the future impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Houston Electric’s PUCT-approved tariff outlines the remedies available to Houston Electric in the event that a REP defaults on amounts owed.  Among the remedies available to Houston Electric are seeking recourse against any cash deposit, letter of credit, or surety bond provided by the REP or implementing mutually agreeable terms with the REP.  Another remedy is to require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort.  Houston Electric thus incurs risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2022 was $252 million. Approximately 39% and 18% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If a REP was unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made regarding prior payments Houston Electric had received from such REP. For example, following the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, multiple REPs filed for bankruptcy. We are currently capturing the amounts owed by these REPs as a permitted regulatory asset for bad debt expenses, which will be subject to a reasonableness review by the PUCT when we seek recovery in our next base rate case. As of both December 31, 2022 and 2021, as authorized by the PUCT, CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric recorded a regulatory asset of $8 million for bad debt expenses resulting from REPs’ default on their obligation to pay delivery charges to Houston Electric net of collateral. There is no guarantee that we will be able to recover any or all of the regulatory asset in our next base rate case. See “— Rate Regulation of Registrants’ Electric ...” Indiana Electric’s execution of its generation transition plan, including its IRP, are subject to various risks, including timely recovery of capital investments and increased costs and risks related to the timing and cost of development and/or construction of new generation facilities. Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP to the IURC every three years, unless extended, that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period. Indiana Electric has used past IRPs and will continue to use future IRPs to evaluate its mix of generation resources. Indiana Electric engages with the communities it serves, its regulators and third-parties in developing its generation transition plan. Recent IRPs have demonstrated Indiana Electric can most cost effectively serve its customers by transitioning its generation fleet to a wider mix of resources, including renewables. For example, Indiana Electric’s 2019/2020 IRP identified a preferred portfolio that retires 730 MW of coal-fired generation facilities and replaces these resources with a mix of generating resources composed primarily of renewables, including solar, wind, and solar with storage, supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation. Indiana Electric is now preparing a new IRP to be filed in 2023 for which it has conducted a request for proposals to identify the cost of generating resources, including renewables, thermal and demand-side resources, and short-term capacity to meet the future needs of its electric customers. While the IURC does not approve or reject Indiana Electric’s IRP, the IURC does comment on the IRP. Indiana Electric is required to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing or acquiring generating resources. Indiana Electric also obtains IURC approval of PPAs and DSM plans to ensure cost recovery. Indiana Electric must manage several risks associated with its generation transition plan. The IURC may delay providing comments on Indiana Electric’s IRP, requiring Indiana Electric to either wait for comments or proceed to implement its IRP without IURC comments. The IURC comments may raise concerns with Indiana Electric’s IRP that make it difficult to obtain approval of the generation transition plan if not addressed. There is no guarantee that the IURC will approve Indiana Electric’s requests to implement part of its generation transition. If Indiana Electric fails to receive IURC approvals necessary to acquire the projects or resources identified in its IRP, Indiana Electric may not be able to implement its generation transition plan in a timely manner or at all. If Indiana Electric is unable to implement its generation transition plan, it may have an adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to execute on its net zero and carbon emission goals, its growth strategy, achieve financial targets, and otherwise impact results of operations and cash flows. Even if a generation project is approved, risks associated with the development or construction of any new generation exist, including new legislation restricting or delaying new generation, moratorium legislation, the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, scarcity of resources and labor, ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation, the effects of potential construction delays, project scope changes, and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements.  For example, we, along with our developers of the Posey solar project, have announced plans to downsize the Posey solar project from 300 MW to 191 MW because of supply chain issues experienced in the energy industry, rising cost of commodities and community feedback. Indiana Electric will also seek recovery of costs related to the amendments of the Posey agreement. For additional information, see “— Continued disruptions to the supply...”  Furthermore, we have begun to acquire and/or develop additional solar and wind facilities as part of our capital plan. However, we have not yet entered into definitive agreements with developers for the acquisition and/or development of all of the additional projects, and we face significant competition with other bidders for a limited number of such generation facilities that developers plan to construct and for solar 19panels. For additional information, see “— Increases in the cost or reduction in supply ...” The number of available projects is further limited by the MISO interconnection queue due to potential interconnection costs that may render projects infeasible. As a result, suitable generation facility project candidates or resources necessary to construct such projects may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, or the expected benefits of a completed facility may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If Indiana Electric was unable to meet its generation needs as a result of project delays or cancellations it would be required to buy the necessary capacity and electricity on the open market. Such open market purchases may result in increased costs and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to complete or acquire such generation facilities or resources, or if they do not perform as anticipated, our future growth, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.Increases in the cost or reduction in supply of solar energy system components due to tariffs or trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. government may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.China is a major producer of solar panels and other solar products. Certain solar cells, modules, laminates and panels from China are subject to various antidumping and countervailing duty rates, depending on the exporter supplying the product, imposed by the U.S. government as a result of determinations the United States was materially injured as a result of such imports being sold at less than fair value and subsidized by the Chinese government. In March 2022, the DOC announced it would initiate an investigation into whether imports of solar cells and panels produced in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam are circumventing U.S. rules and laws, such as antidumping and countervailing duty rates, which impose a tariff on imports of solar cells and panels manufactured in China. In December 2022, the DOC issued its preliminary findings noting that circumvention was occurring in each of the four countries. If an affirmative finding is made by the DOC, it could impose duties on imports of solar cells and panels from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam with both forward-looking and retroactive application. In addition, in December 2021, President Biden signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans goods from China’s Xinjiang region due to the use of forced labor. Continuing tensions between the United States and China may lead to restrictions in trade between the two countries or new legislation, tariffs or bans, any of which could further negatively impact the supply of solar panels. These or similar duties and legislation have and may in the future also put upward pressure on prices of these solar energy products, which may reduce our ability to acquire these items in a timely and cost-efficient manner. If we or the developers we are working with are unable to secure such solar energy products in a timely and cost-efficient manner, we may be forced to delay, downsize and/or cancel solar projects and we may not be able to procure the resources needed to fully execute on our ten-year capital plan or achieve our net zero emissions goals. We have experienced project delays due to developers of our projects being unable to acquire solar panels due to supply chain constraints. Additionally, delays or cancellations by developers of third-party solar power facilities expected to interconnect with CenterPoint Energy’s and Houston Electric’s system may have adverse impacts, such as delayed or reduced potential future revenues. We cannot predict what additional actions the U.S. government may adopt with respect to tariffs or other trade regulations in the future or what actions may be taken by other countries in retaliation for such measures. If an affirmative finding is made by the DOC or other additional measures are imposed, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.In the aftermath of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, there have been calls for reform of the Texas electric market, some measure of which, if implemented, could have an adverse impact on Houston Electric.During and in the aftermath of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, the Texas legislature revised applicable statutes and granted the PUCT and ERCOT additional regulatory authority, both oversight and enforcement, that focuses on ensuring ERCOT market participants, including power generation facilities and TDUs (like Houston Electric), have adopted sufficient winterization standards and protection. Houston Electric is in compliance with the requirements applicable to it. If any additional protections are required in the future, complying with these new protections may increase the cost of electricity, which could adversely affect Houston Electric’s results of operations. Any potential decreases in customer usage due to higher electricity prices charged by REPs may not result in increased base rates charged by Houston Electric for its services until its next general base rate proceeding. For further information on Houston Electric’s regulatory proceedings, see “— Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s...”Various governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and the efforts made by various entities to prepare for, and respond to, this event, including the electricity generation shortfall issues. Such agencies and entities include the United States Congress, FERC, NERC, Texas RE, ERCOT, Texas government entities and officials such as the Texas Governor’s office, the Texas Legislature, the Texas Attorney General, the PUCT, the City of Houston and other municipal and county entities in Houston Electric’s service area, among other entities. In addition to questions around preparation and response, some federal and other officials, as well as members of the public and media, have called for reviews and reforms of the Texas electric market, including whether it should continue to be governed by ERCOT or instead be subject to FERC jurisdiction and regulation by joining an ISO such as MISO, as well as the division of the market between power generators, TDUs (such as Houston Electric) and REPs. There are significant uncertainties whether any further market structure or governance changes will result from these 20discussions. If there are changes to how the Texas electric market is structured or regulated, such changes could have an adverse impact on Houston Electric’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.   Houston Electric’s use of TEEEF is subject to various risks, including related failure to obtain and deploy sufficient TEEEF resources, potential performance issues and allegations about Houston Electric’s deployment of the resources (including the planning, execution, and effectiveness of the same), regulatory and environmental requirements, and timely recovery of capital. Following the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, the Texas legislature passed a law, effective September 1, 2021, that allows TDUs, such as Houston Electric, to lease and temporarily operate back-up generation resources during widespread power outages where ERCOT has ordered a TDU to Load Shed or the TDU’s distribution facilities are not being fully served by the bulk power system under normal operations. In response to this legislation, Houston Electric entered into two leases for TEEEF (mobile generation). If Houston Electric is otherwise unable to deploy a sufficient number of TEEEF in time to respond to a particular event; if the TEEEF fail to perform as intended; if Houston Electric is otherwise unable to provide back-up generation resources and restore power as intended; or if the use of TEEEF or their failure to perform causes or is alleged to cause any personal injury, property damage, or other damage or loss due to allegations it failed to deploy such units reasonably or effectively and failed to respond to particular power outages, Houston Electric could be subject to claims, demands, litigation, liability, regulatory scrutiny, and loss of reputation.  While Houston Electric has insurance coverage and indemnity rights for its use of TEEEF, if its insurers or indemnitors fail to meet their indemnity obligations, Houston Electric could be liable for personal injury, property damage, or other damage or loss. As noted above, the legislation prescribes specific and limited use for the TEEEF, and Houston Electric’s TEEEF have limited generation capacity, such that in future events customers could still be without power despite deployment of the TEEEF. Further, the TEEEF are subject to various environmental regulations and permitting requirements, which could have an impact on Houston Electric’s ability to use these units. If Houston Electric is not in compliance with any environmental regulation or permitting requirement, Houston Electric could be subject to further potential liability.  The use of TEEEF is also subject to various requirements, and failure to comply with them could subject Houston Electric to additional liability as well as challenges to its use of TEEEF in general. Additionally, Houston Electric’s recovery of its costs for TEEEF is not certain. In April 2022, Houston Electric sought to recover its costs for TEEEF through a DCRF application. In July 2022, Houston Electric amended its filing to include the TEEEF cost in a separate rider and intervenors filed testimony in September 2022 challenging the acquisition and deployment of TEEEF. On January 27, 2023, the administrative law judges issued a proposal for decision recommending that the leasing of the TEEEF was not prudent or reasonable and necessary and that the PUCT deny recovery of all of the TEEEF costs. The PUCT is expected to consider the proposal for decision on March 9, 2023. If Houston Electric is unable to recover any or all of its TEEEF costs, it could have an adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For further information, see “— Rate Regulation of Houston Electric’s...”, “— Our insurance coverage may not...” and “— We are subject to operational...”  Natural Gas (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for Natural Gas’ customers.Natural Gas depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. Substantially all of Natural Gas’ natural gas supply is purchased on intrastate and interstate pipelines. If Natural Gas is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet Natural Gas’ requirements, the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in Natural Gas’ service territories could have an adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather conditions, acts of terrorism or cyberattacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, could also adversely affect Natural Gas’ businesses. Further, to the extent that Natural Gas’ natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then Natural Gas’ operations could be negatively affected. 21Natural Gas is subject to fluctuations in natural gas prices, which could affect the ability of its suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or may impact its operations which could adversely affect CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Natural Gas is subject to risk associated with changes in the price of natural gas. Significant increases in natural gas prices, such as those experienced during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, might affect Natural Gas’ ability to collect balances due from customers and could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which Natural Gas operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that Natural Gas’ suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Natural Gas must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas delivered and have an adverse impact on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Natural Gas competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and natural gas marketers also compete directly with Natural Gas for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass Natural Gas’ facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas delivered by Natural Gas as a result of competition with alternate energy sources may have an adverse impact on CenterPoint Energy and CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors such as changes in customers’ perceptions from incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic, climate and market conditions in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives, use of alternative technologies and changes in our customers’ perceptions regarding natural gas usage as a result of incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, bans on or further regulation of natural gas-fired appliances, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, including population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. Declines in demand for electricity and natural gas in our service territories due to pipeline incidents of other utilities, increased electricity and natural gas prices as experienced during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and economic downturns, among other factors, could reduce overall usage and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and natural gas. Although Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity delivered and used as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. A reduction in the rate of economic, employment and/or population growth could result in lower growth and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in such service territories. Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or natural gas or number of customers and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Energy Systems Group (CenterPoint Energy)Energy Systems Group’s operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.Energy Systems Group’s business results are dependent on a number of factors. The industry in which Energy Systems Group operates is competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should Energy Systems Group be unsuccessful in bidding contracts (for example, federal Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts), results of operations could be impacted. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by Energy Systems Group operate could adversely impact operating results. Additionally, Energy Systems Group’s business is subject to other risks including, but not 22limited to, the following: the discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs; increases in tax liability, such as due to changes in legislation or the interpretation of existing guidelines; the inability of customers to finance projects; failure to appropriately design, construct or operate projects; increased project delays and backlogs, particularly in the federal sector, increases in costs and shortages in supply materials and other factors; cancellation of projects by customers or reductions in the scope of the projects; and obligations related to warranties, guarantees and other contractual and legal obligations. Energy Systems Group’s business has performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by CenterPoint Energy. In the normal course of business, Energy Systems Group issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations. As the parent company, CenterPoint Energy or Vectren has, and will, from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries’ commitments. These guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations; rather, they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral. Neither CenterPoint Energy nor Vectren has been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees to date. For further information, see Note 15(c) to the consolidated financial statements. Risk Factors
 Affecting Regulatory, Environmental and Legal RisksRate regulation of Registrants’ Electric and Natural Gas businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully and timely recover their costs.The Registrants’ Electric and Natural Gas businesses are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions. Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) based on an analysis of their invested capital, their expenses and other factors in a designated test year (often either fully or partially historic), subject to periodic review and adjustments. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of the Registrants’ control. Houston Electric, Indiana Electric and CERC each plan to file rate cases during 2023. The Registrants can make no assurance that their or their subsidiaries respective base rate proceedings will result in requested or favorable adjustments to their rates, in full and timely cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, the Registrants’ Electric and/or Natural Gas businesses to recover their investments below their requested levels, below the national average return for utilities or below recently approved return levels for other utilities in their respective jurisdictions. For instance, in the 2019 Houston Electric general rate case, Houston Electric filed a base rate case seeking approval for revenue increases of approximately $194 million and a 10.4% ROE, but after entering into a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement filed with the PUCT, Houston Electric received an overall revenue requirement increase of approximately $13 million and a 9.4% ROE. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow the Registrants to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Further, the Registrants or their subsidiaries might be required to implement additional measures, such as the adoption of ring-fencing measures by Houston Electric in connection with its 2019 rate case proceeding. Such additional measures may adversely impact the Registrant’s businesses and could have an adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The rates that Registrants’ Electric and Natural Gas businesses are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time, a situation referred to as “regulatory lag.” Regulatory lag has been and may be exaggerated in the future under certain circumstances, such as increasing inflation rates like those experienced in 2022. For example, the MPUC has ordered the amortization period for extraordinary gas costs resulting from the February 2021 Winter Storm Event be increased from 27-months to 63-months beginning on January 1, 2022, and CERC forego recovery of the associated carrying costs to make customer monthly bills more affordable and due to carrying costs not being typically recoverable in Minnesota. Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by the Registrants and their subsidiaries to reduce the effects of regulatory lag (for example, CSIA, DCRF, DRR, DSMA, GRIP, RCRA, RRA, RSP, TCOS and TDSIC), such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval, which we cannot assure would be approved, and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce or otherwise impede the Registrants’ or their subsidiaries ability to adjust its rates or result in rates below those requested. Therefore, the Registrants can make no assurance filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery.  Further, from time to time, the Registrants’ regulators approve the issuance of securitization bonds in order to recover certain costs, including costs incurred as a result of severe weather or to recover stranded asset costs. The issuance of these securitization bonds may be delayed. For instance, CenterPoint Energy and CERC have filed for securitization of natural gas costs in Texas, received commission approval and issuance of a financing order in 2022, and expect the Texas Public Financing Authority to issue customer rate relief bonds in first half of 2023. If the issuance of such securitization bonds is delayed, we may not be able 23to recover our costs in a timely manner, which could have an adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk jurisdictional regulatory authorities may challenge the reasonableness or prudency of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by the Registrants or their subsidiaries and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates. From time to time, these reviews and investigations have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, the Registrants’ to recover their costs or investments below their requested levels.  For example, in October 2022, the MPUC issued a written order disallowing recovery of approximately $36 million of the $409 million originally requested by CERC in connection with its recovery of costs incurred as a result of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event. In November 2022, CERC filed a petition for reconsideration with the MPUC and the MPUC issued a written order denying the petition on January 6, 2023.  Notwithstanding the application of such rate adjustment mechanisms, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of legislative processes or rulemakings, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of the Registrants’ or their subsidiaries’ costs or enable them to earn their authorized return. Changes to the rate case or interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact the Registrants’ ability to recover their costs in a timely manner.  To the extent the regulatory process does not allow the Registrants to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For further information on rate case proceedings and interim rate adjustment mechanisms, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.  We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations, including regulation of CCR, climate change legislation and certain local initiatives that seek to limit fossil fuel usage.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric generating facilities and electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, including among others, restricting the use of fossil fuels through future climate legislation or regulation, restricting the use of natural gas-fired appliances in new homes, limiting airborne emissions from generating facilities, restricting the way we manage wastes, including wastewater discharges, air emissions and CCR removal, and requiring remedial action or monitoring to mitigate environmental actions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. We may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to comply with these requirements. For example, Indiana Electric has determined that two ponds, one at F.B. Culley and one at A.B. Brown, were required to be closed under the CCR Rule. Indiana Electric has timely filed extension requests under the CCR Rule. If Indiana Electric does not receive approval of these or future extension requests, Indiana Electric may have increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system. Further, in the course of operations we have released, and may in the future inadvertently release, various contaminants. Any such releases could have a significant impact on the environment and result in significant fines. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, which we have been subject to from time to time, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean, restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.Regulatory agencies have also adopted, and from time to time consider adopting, new legislation and/or modifying existing laws and regulations to reduce GHGs. There continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, which is expected to continue under the current administration. On April 22, 2021, President Biden announced new goals of 50% reduction of economy-wide GHG emissions and 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035, which formed the basis of the United States’ commitments announced in Glasgow, Scotland. Reentry into the Paris Agreement, revised climate commitments coming out of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Glasgow and President Biden’s executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. Potential future restrictions include, among other things, the United States enacting additional GHG regulations and mandated financial, emissions and other disclosures. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas and electricity, and a generator of electricity in Indiana, the Registrants’ revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or that would have the effect of reducing the 24consumption of natural gas or electricity or prevent the use of certain fuel types. Also, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services. For further discussion, see “Business—Environmental Matters” in Item 1 and “ —Natural Gas must compete with...”Evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s electric generation and natural gas businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy’s financing arrangements. Further, some investors choose to not invest in CenterPoint Energy due to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s use of fossil fuels. Also, certain cities in CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s Natural Gas operational footprint have discussed the adoption of initiatives to prohibit the construction of new natural gas facilities that would provide service and focus on electrification. For example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas. Certain state and local governments in states such as New York and California have also passed, or are considering, legislation banning the use of natural gas-fired appliances in new homes, which could affect consumer use of natural gas. Should such bans be enacted within Natural Gas’ operational footprint, they could adversely affect consumer demand for natural gas. Any such initiatives and legislation could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s results of operations.CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities associated with the implementation of and efforts to achieve its carbon emissions reduction goals.In September 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its net zero emission goals for Scope 1 and certain Scope 2 emissions by 2035 and a 20-30% reduction in certain Scope 3 emissions by 2035 as compared to 2021 levels. CenterPoint Energy’s analysis and plan for execution requires it to make a number of assumptions. These goals and underlying assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees. Should one or more of CenterPoint Energy’s underlying assumptions prove incorrect, its actual results and ability to achieve net zero emissions by 2035 could differ materially from its expectations. Certain of the assumptions that could impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its net zero emissions goals include, but are not limited to: emission levels, service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with expectations (inclusive of changes related to the sale of CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma); regulatory approval of Indiana Electric’s generation transition plan; impacts of future environmental regulations or legislation; impacts of future carbon pricing regulation or legislation, including a future carbon tax; price, availability and regulation of carbon offsets; price of fuel, such as natural gas; cost of energy generation technologies, such as wind and solar, natural gas and storage solutions; adoption of alternative energy by the public, including adoption of electric vehicles; rate of technology innovation with regards to alternative energy resources; CenterPoint Energy’s ability to implement its modernization plans for its pipelines and facilities; the ability to complete and timely implement generation alternatives, such as solar and wind generation, to Indiana Electric’s coal generation and retirement dates of Indiana Electric’s coal facilities by 2035; the ability to construct and/or permit new natural gas pipelines; the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, the lack of or scarcity of resources and labor, any project cancellations, construction delays or overruns and the ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation; impact of any supply chain disruptions; changes in applicable standards or methodologies; and enhancement of energy efficiencies. Our businesses may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives we announce, our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them, and related disclosures. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.Developing and implementing plans for compliance with voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. To the extent that we believe any of these costs are recoverable in rates, cost recovery could be resisted by our regulators and our regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Moreover, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving our emissions reduction goals, or the various implementation aspects, on our system reliability or our financial condition and results of operations.25Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, as a member of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, could be subject to higher costs for system improvements, as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of FERC mandatory reliability standards.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions. As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems. In addition, the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO, respectively. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation, and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a Delaware non-profit corporation. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures, which may not be fully recoverable in rates. While Houston Electric and Indiana Electric have received minor fines in the past for noncompliance, if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards again, they would be subject to sanctions, including potential monetary penalties, which could range as high as over a million dollars per violation per day, and non-monetary penalties, such as having to file a mitigation plan to prevent recurrence of a similar violation and having certain milestones in such plan tracked.We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, including lawsuits and environmental matters in addition to regulatory proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties; recent trends suggest jury verdicts and other liability have been increasing; and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Additionally, under some circumstances, the Registrants could potentially have claims filed against them or incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them as a result of sales, divestitures or other transfers to third parties who may be unable to fulfill their indemnity obligations to the Registrants. Final resolution of these matters, or any potential future claims or liabilities, may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have an adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial results.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, including as part of our Ethics and Compliance program’s efforts to detect misconduct, we become aware of and expect to continue to become aware of instances of employee misconduct, which we investigate, remediate and disclose as appropriate and proportionate to the incident.Risk Factors
 Affecting Financial, Economic and Market RisksContinued disruptions to the global supply chain may lead to higher prices for goods and services and impact our operations, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our capital plan and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The global supply chain has experienced and is expected to continue to experience disruptions due to a multitude of factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages, resource availability, long lead time, inflation and weather, and these disruptions have adversely impacted the utility industry. We, as well as other companies in our industry, have experienced supply chain disruptions, as well as increased prices, and we may continue to experience this in the future. Examples of materials necessary for the transmission and distribution of power we and our industry have experienced difficulties in procuring include transformers, wires, cables, meters, poles and solar panels. We may continue to experience difficulties in procuring these resources and others necessary to operate our businesses in the future, and if we were to experience other 26significant supply chain disruptions in the future, we may not be able to procure the resources, including labor, needed to timely perform storm restoration activities, fully execute on our ten-year capital plan or achieve our net zero emission goals. Moreover, high inflation and rising interest rates continue to be an area of economic concern and has contributed to the increased prices for materials and services that have been experienced by us and other companies in our industry. Even if we are able to procure the necessary resources, we might not be able to do so at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner which could result in project cancellations or scope changes, delays, cost overruns and under-recovery of costs. If we are unable to fully execute on capital plans as a result of supply chain disruptions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that derives all of its operating income from, and holds substantially all of its assets through, its subsidiaries. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions. CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from, and holds substantially all of its assets through, its subsidiaries. Similarly, as a result of the Restructuring, CERC derives a significant portion of its operating income from and holds a significant portion of its assets through its subsidiaries, including Indiana Gas and VEDO. As a result, CenterPoint Energy and to a lesser extent, CERC, depend on the performance of and distributions from their respective subsidiaries to meet their respective payment obligations and to pay dividends on their respective common and/or preferred stock.  In general, CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide them with funds for their respective payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s respective subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy or CERC, and their respective subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make payments or other distributions. Further, as part of Houston Electric’s 2019 base rate case, Houston Electric agreed to certain “ring-fencing” measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy. Houston Electric is expected to file a base rate proceeding in late 2023. In this proceeding, Houston Electric may be requested to institute further ring-fencing measures or further ring-fencing measures could be imposed on Houston Electric in the future through legislation or PUCT rules or orders. While current ring-fencing measures have not impacted Houston Electric’s ability to pay dividends to CenterPoint Energy, the imposition of any additional measures impacting CenterPoint Energy’s ability to receive dividends from Houston Electric could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. Any such adverse effect on CenterPoint Energy could also adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations as CenterPoint Energy may not be able to financially support Houston Electric if and when necessary. CenterPoint Energy’s right to receive assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, are structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would likely be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any senior indebtedness of the subsidiary.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive, and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures. For example, we depend on (i) long-term debt, (ii) borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and, for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, commercial paper programs and (iii) if market conditions permit, issuances of additional shares of common or preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy. We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures. Additionally, from time to time, our operating subsidiaries, including Houston Electric and CERC, may rely on intercompany borrowings from CenterPoint Energy that may be sourced from CenterPoint Energy’s external financings. As of December 31, 2022, CenterPoint Energy had $17 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $317 million of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. For information on outstanding indebtedness of Houston Electric and CERC as well as future maturities, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions, including inflation;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•the future performance of our businesses;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•actions from the Federal Reserve, including further interest rate increases and unanticipated actions; 27•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•investor willingness to invest in companies associated with fossil fuels; •our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms; •timing of future securitizations by jurisdictions in which we operate; and•provisions of relevant securities laws.The Registrants’ current credit ratings and any changes in credit ratings in 2022 and to date in 2023 are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be reduced or withdrawn by a rating agency. The Registrants note these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold their securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have an adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms. For example, if CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it may have an adverse impact on the cost of borrowings and, in extraordinary market conditions, it may limit the ability to access the debt capital markets. Additionally, CERC might be required to post collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. CERC also expects to receive approximately $1.1 billion in proceeds from the issuance of customer rate relief bonds by Texas Public Financing Authority in the first half of 2023 to reimburse CERC’s natural gas costs incurred as a result of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event. Such proceeds were originally expected to be received in 2022.  The failure to receive such proceeds or any further delay could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment could reduce our earnings.Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2020, CenterPoint Energy identified and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $185 million in the Indiana Electric reporting unit. No impairments to goodwill were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Should the annual goodwill impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity, increasing balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A non-cash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact its cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. CenterPoint Energy has approximately $828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31, 2022. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($26 million in the aggregate, or $1.86 per ZENS, as of December 31, 2022), or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  CenterPoint Energy’s ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31, 2022, deferred taxes of approximately $665 million would have been payable in 2022, based on 2022 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2022 to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $80 million would have been payable in 2022. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. This could happen if CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop, the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities shares would typically be disposed when ZENS are exchanged and ZENS-Related Securities shares are sold.28Dividend requirements associated with CenterPoint Energy’s Series A Preferred Stock subject it to certain risks.CenterPoint Energy has 800,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. Any future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays, on its Series A Preferred Stock will depend on, among other things, its financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy, as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when due could adversely impact our ability to access capital on acceptable terms and would likely have an adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock and CenterPoint Energy’s debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy, under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.Further, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such shares, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energy’s capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock (as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs) upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.The  replacement of LIBOR, or SOFR, with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the cost of capital related to outstanding debt and other financial instruments. LIBOR is currently the basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on variable rate loans and other securities. Certain financial instruments entered into by the Registrants’ subsidiaries, use LIBOR as a reference rate.  Beginning January 1, 2022, the Financial Conduct Authority ceased publishing one week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and is expected to cease publishing all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors in June 2023 unless cessation is further extended.  Each of the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities, including certain facilities or financial instruments entered into by their subsidiaries, use SOFR as a reference rate.  Because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from LIBOR. Any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR’s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.  Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR (or SOFR) with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. Each of the Registrants’ credit facilities provide for a mechanism to replace SOFR with possible alternative benchmarks upon certain benchmark replacement events. We will evaluate  the potential impact of any such potential benchmark replacements should it occur.    Our potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend, in part, on our management’s ability to implement our business strategies successfully and realize the anticipated benefits therefrom. In 2021, we announced our strategic goals for the Company, including our ten-year long-term capital plan, and net zero and carbon emission reduction goals. Our strategic goals are subject to the risks described in this section and various assumptions. These assumptions may be proven incorrect or we may not be able to execute on these strategic goals in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to execute on our strategic goals, including our long-term capital plan, the benefits therefrom may not be fully realized, if at all, and our reputation may be adversely affected. From time to time we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, such as our completed sale of our Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma and the completed Enable Merger and subsequent sale of Energy Transfer Common Units and Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings, such as the recently completed Restructuring. However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions or dispositions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we are unable to make 29acquisitions, or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our future growth may be adversely affected. Further, any completed or future acquisitions or dispositions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; •acquisitions or dispositions, or the pursuit of such transactions, including any separation or disentanglement efforts or requirements, such as the provision of transition services, could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures; and•we may not receive regulatory approvals necessary to complete an acquisition or disposition in a timely manner or at all. Changing demographics, poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees. Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, contributions to the plan, the number of plan participants and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations, or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In 2022 and 2021, the Company had a settlement expense for its pension plans as a result of an increase in eligible employee retirements and pension plan distributions.  See Note 8 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.  In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements, these factors could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.We may be significantly affected by changes in federal income tax laws and regulations, including any comprehensive federal tax reform legislation.Our businesses are impacted by U.S. federal income tax policy. The TCJA, CARES Act, and the IRA significantly changed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including taxation of U.S. corporations, by among other things, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate, limiting interest deductions, altering the expensing of capital expenditures, enacting a new corporate alternative minimum tax, and expanding federal tax credits for cleaner energy production. Based on information and forecasts as of December 31, 2022, the Registrants’ may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax included in the IRA.The interpretive guidance issued by the IRS and state tax authorities may be inconsistent with our interpretation and the legislation could be subject to amendments, which could lessen or increase certain impacts of the legislation. In addition, the retail regulatory treatment of the expanded tax credits and corporate alternative minimum tax could impact the Registrants’ future cash flows, and this legislation could result in unintended consequences not yet identified that could have an adverse impact on the Registrants’ financial results and future cash flows. Further federal tax reform legislation could be enacted that may significantly change the federal income tax laws applicable to domestic businesses, including changes that may increase the federal income tax rate and impact investment incentives and deductions for depreciation and interest, among other deductions. While CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries cannot assess the overall impact of any such potential legislation on our businesses, it is possible that our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, with any enacted federal tax reform legislation, it is uncertain how state commissions and local municipalities may require us to respond to the effects of such tax legislation, including determining the treatment of EDIT and other increases and decreases in our revenue requirements. As such, potential regulatory actions in response to any enacted tax legislation could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.30Risk Factors
 Affecting Safety and Security RisksThe Registrants’ businesses have safety risks. The Registrants’ facilities and distribution and transmission systems have been and may in the future be involved in incidents that result in injury, death, or property loss to employees, customers, third parties, or the public. Although the Registrants have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, they could experience financial loss, claims and litigation, damage to their reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory authorities or other public authorities. Cyberattacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, operational technology, network infrastructure, and other technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our businesses, which includes, among other things, (i) managing operations and other business processes and (ii) protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. For example, the operation of our electric generation, transmission and distribution systems are dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our systems and third-party systems. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of the intelligent grid, smart devices and operational technologies across our businesses. Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyberattack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems. Similarly, our business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. For example, the operation of an efficient deregulated wholesale and retail electric market in Texas mandates communication with ERCOT, and competitive retailers; and our Indiana Electric organization has a similar relationship with MISO. Also, the distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with third-party systems. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by man-made events, such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability to conduct operations and control assets.Cyberattacks, including phishing attacks and threats from the use of malicious code such as malware, ransomware and viruses, and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us to possible legal claims and liability. While we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology, operational technology, and data systems from such attacks, our cybersecurity program does not prevent all breaches or cyberattack incidents. We have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber intrusions and attacks to our information systems and those of third parties, including vendors, suppliers, contractors and quasi government entities, like ERCOT and MISO, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information. These prior intrusions and attacks have not had a material impact on our operations. Because technology is increasingly complex and cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, there is a risk such incidents could have an adverse effect on us in the future. The risk of a disruption or breach of our operational technology systems, or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations, through a cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world. We are not fully insured against all cybersecurity risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We depend on the secure operations of our physical assets to transport the energy we deliver and our information technology to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information and operational technology we use to safely operate our energy transportation systems. Security breaches, attacks on our infrastructure and facilities, including against the Registrants’ or as a means to harm a third-party by disrupting the transmission and distribution of energy, or acts of terrorism, including by foreign or domestic actors, could expose our business to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of critical physical assets or information and functions that affect our operations, as well as potential data privacy breaches and loss of protected personal information and other sensitive information such as Critical Energy Infrastructure Information. Such losses could result in operational impacts, damage to our assets, public or personal safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation and a potential adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There is no certainty costs incurred related to actual or thwarted cyberattacks, or for the safeguarding against such security threats, will be recoverable through rates. 31Compliance with and changes in cybersecurity laws and regulations have a cost and operational impact on our business, and failure to comply with such requirements could adversely impact our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, and U.S. government warnings have indicated infrastructure assets, including pipelines and electric generation and infrastructure, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. In the second and third quarters of 2021, the TSA announced two new security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that occurred in 2021. These directives required critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements. In the third quarter of 2022, the TSA announced a third security directive requiring critical pipeline owners to establish and implement a TSA-approved Cybersecurity Implementation Plan, develop and maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, and establish a Cybersecurity Assessment Plan. Pipeline owners are required to continue to implement the measures outlined in the second directive until such time as an organization’s Cybersecurity Implementation Plan is approved. TSA approved CenterPoint Energy’s Cybersecurity Implementation Plan in December 2022. We may be required to expend significant additional resources and costs to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. There is no certainty that such costs incurred will be recovered through rates. Any failure to remain in compliance with these government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.In connection with our businesses, we and our vendors, suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information (for example, information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy continues to evolve and is increasingly demanding. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. While we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology, operational technology, and data systems from attacks, and while we have implemented and maintain a data privacy program designed to manage and protect personal information from attacks, neither program can prevent all security or privacy breaches. We and some of our third party vendors who maintain personally identifiable information have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, data privacy incidents and breaches. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions and other legal requirements could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection privacy, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.General and Other RisksOur revenues and results of operations are seasonal.Houston Electric’s, Indiana Electric’s and Natural Gas’ revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity and natural gas usage, as applicable. Houston Electric’s revenues are generally higher during the warmer months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electric’s results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as in certain past years, extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. A significant portion of Indiana Electric’s sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, as in certain past years, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather, while, as has occurred in certain past years, more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. Natural Gas’ revenues are customarily higher during the winter months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish Natural Gas’ results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as occurred in certain past years, extreme cold weather conditions could increase its results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. For information related to weather normalization regulatory mechanisms and weather hedges, see Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see Note 7 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.32Climate change could adversely impact financial results from our businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events that could adversely affect our results of operations.A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories and our business. If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures than normal in our service territories, financial results from our businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, where natural gas is used to heat homes and businesses, warmer weather might result in less natural gas being used, adversely affecting us. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and severe winter weather conditions, including ice storms, all of which may impact our operations and ability to serve our customers. To the extent the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increases, our costs of providing service may increase, including the costs and availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and those costs may not be recoverable. Further, events of extreme weather could make it unsafe or hinder the effectiveness of our employees to fix, maintain and restore power to affected areas and could harm our reputation. Since certain of our facilities are located along or near the Texas gulf coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers. Our Electric and Natural Gas operations in our service territories were both also impacted by the February 2021 Winter Storm Event.  In the long term, climate change could also cause shifts in population, including customers moving away from our service territories. When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results are impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we are unable to recover those costs or recover in a timely manner, or if recovery of such costs results in higher rates and reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Similarly, public and private efforts to address climate change, such as by legislation, regulation, actions by private interest groups, and litigation, could impact our ability to continue operating our businesses as we do today, significant aspects of which rely on fossil fuels. These initiatives could have a significant impact on us and our operations as well as on our third party suppliers, vendors and partners, which could impact us by among other things, causing permitting and construction delays, project cancellations or increased project costs passed on to us. For further information on these initiatives, please see “— We are subject to operational…” Finally, we may be subject to climate change litigation, which could result in substantial fines, penalties or damages and restrictions on our operations. The oil and gas industry has already faced such litigation, challenging its marketing and use of fossil fuels and attributing climate change to emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels, and other industries, including ours, could face such litigation in the future.  For more information, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, and “— CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks...” Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets, including the failure of equipment or processes and potential breakdowns due to such aging. The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs because of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs. As part of our long-term capital plan, we continue to make upgrades to our aging infrastructure assets to enhance the reliability of our infrastructure. Failure to achieve timely and full recovery of expenses associated with our aging infrastructure could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. In addition, the nature of information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Also, our ability to successfully maintain or replace our aging infrastructure may be delayed or be at a greater cost than anticipated due to supply chain disruptions. Further, with respect to Natural Gas’ operations, if certain pipeline replacements (for example, cast-iron or bare steel pipe) are not completed timely or successfully, government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires, explosions or leaks. Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, aging infrastructure may complicate our utility operations ability to address climate change concerns and efforts to enhance resiliency and reliability. See “— Continued disruptions to the supply...” Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks inherent in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and in the delivery of natural gas that could result in substantial losses or other damages. From time to time, we have and may in the future experience various risks associated with the operations of our facilities, including, but not limited to, the following:33•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols for, among others, the transmission and distribution of electricity and in the delivery of natural gas, including operations of our peak shaving, propane-air facilities;•the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes;•information technology or financial and billing system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•failure to obtain in a timely manner and at reasonable prices the necessary fuel, such as coal and natural gas, building materials or other items needed to operate our facilities;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, ice storms, flooding, terrorism, wildfires, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, including any environmental impacts related thereto, which catastrophic events may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such events have and may in the future result in the imposition of regulatory or environmental fines and increased litigation. Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change. We operate businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant investments and expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar, microturbines, fuel cells), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce energy consumption and waste. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, including Indiana Electric’s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Similarly to the impact of rising inflation and rising interest rates, among other items that incentivize our customers to consume less energy, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner, to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.    Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We currently have insurance in place, such as general liability and property insurance, to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to fully cover or restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 34Costs, damages and other liabilities related to recent events and incidents that affected other utilities, such as wildfires, winter storms and explosions, among other things, have exceeded or could exceed such utilities’ insurance coverage. Further, as a result of these recent events and incidents, the marketplace for insurance coverage to utility companies may be unavailable or limited in capacity or any such available coverage may be deemed by us to be cost prohibitive under current conditions. Insurance premiums for any such coverage, if available, may not be eligible for recovery, whether in full or in part, by us through the rates charged by our utility businesses.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and insurance capacity to be limited. Historically, Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise.  In the future, any such recovery may not be granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Global or regional health pandemics, epidemics or similar public health threats could negatively impact our business, outlook, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.Current and future health pandemics, epidemics and similar public health threats, such as COVID-19 and its variants, and the measures implemented to contain their spread, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines and vaccination mandates, continue to and may in the future have widespread impacts on the global economy, our employees, customers, and third-party business partners. The severity, magnitude and duration of a current or future health threat  is uncertain, rapidly changing and hard to predict. Any future health threat, including the emergence of a new variant of COVID-19, could, in the future, impact our business in numerous ways, including, but not limited to, those outlined below:•reduced demand from our commercial and industrial customers and shifts in demand for our services;•delay the timeliness of our service to customers because of shutdowns and/or illness and travel restrictions among our employees; •negatively impact the financial condition of our customers and REPs and their ability to pay for our services, and our ability to disconnect service for non-payment may be limited, and state regulators may impose bill deferral programs; •may limit or curtail significantly or entirely the ability of public utility commissions to approve or authorize applications and other requests we may make with respect to our businesses, including delaying rate making proceedings; •increased risk to our cybersecurity program as a result of an increase in cyber attacks during the pandemic and increased remote working arrangements, see above “Risks Affecting our Safety and Security Risks”; •increased rates of inflation and delays in our supply chain and our ability to complete maintenance, repairs, and capital programs, which could result in disruption, increased costs and our inability to execute on or require us to make modifications to our capital plan; and •accelerated employee turnover as a result of concerns regarding restrictions and guidelines, including mask mandates and quarantine mandates, and increased acceptability of alternative work arrangements.  Like many companies, we experienced the above and other impacts pursuant to the COVID-19 pandemic. These and other impacts of global or regional health pandemics, epidemics or similar public health threats could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this section and the other reports we file from time to time with the SEC. We might not be able to predict or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our operations, financial condition and liquidity. The ultimate impact of public health threats on our business depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain the spread and mitigate the public health effects. Any of these factors could have a negative impact on our business, outlook, financial condition and results of operations, which impact could be material. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. Further tightening of the labor market and increasing wages to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively 35transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain good labor relations could adversely impact the operations of our facilities and our results of operations.Our businesses are dependent on recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. Like many companies in the utilities industry and other industries, we have experienced higher than normal turnover of employees as a result of a number of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, a tightening labor market, increasing remote working opportunities, employees shifting industries, individuals deciding not to work and a maturing workforce. Of our employee population, not including employees of Energy Systems Group or temporary employees, 19.3%, 23.6% and 26.1% were retirement eligible as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our businesses, particularly the specialized skills and knowledge required to construct and operate generation facilities, a technology-enabled power grid and transmission and distribution infrastructure, among other facilities. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our ability to execute on our 10-year capital plan and our results of operations could be negatively affected.Furthermore, the operations of our facilities depend on good labor relations with our employees, and several of our businesses have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions, comprising approximately 39% of our workforce. We have several separate bargaining units, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described further in Note 8(j) to the consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. The collective bargaining agreements with IBEW 1393, USW 12213, USW 7441 related to Natural Gas employees and IBEW 66 related to Houston Electric employees are scheduled to expire in May 2023 for IBEW 66 and the remainder are scheduled to expire in December 2023, and negotiations of these agreements are expected to be completed before the respective expirations. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and cash flows"
6,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2022-02-22,"Risk Factors
 CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric, CERC, SIGECO, Indiana Gas and VEDO. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10-K, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company and the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s businesses. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those indicated in any forward-17looking statement or projection contained in this combined report on Form 10-K, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings” in Item 7, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in this Item 1A. Carefully consider each of the risks described below, including those relating to Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined report on Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its subsidiaries. Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionCenterPoint Energy is a holding company that derives all of its operating income from, and holds substantially all of its assets through, its subsidiaries. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions. CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from, and holds substantially all of its assets through, its subsidiaries. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. In general, CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy, and its subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make payments or other distributions. Further, Houston Electric has agreed to certain “ring-fencing” measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy. Further ring-fencing measures could be imposed on Houston Electric in the future through legislation or PUCT rules or orders. While current ring-fencing measures have not impacted Houston Electric’s ability to pay dividends to CenterPoint Energy, the imposition of any additional measures impacting CenterPoint Energy’s ability to receive dividends from Houston Electric could materially adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. CenterPoint Energy’s right to receive assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, are structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would likely be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any senior indebtedness of the subsidiary.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive, and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures. For example, we depend on (i) long-term debt, (ii) borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and, for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, commercial paper programs and (iii) if market conditions permit, issuances of additional shares of common or preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy. We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures. As of December 31, 2021, CenterPoint Energy had $16 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $537 million of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. For information on outstanding indebtedness of Houston Electric and CERC as well as future maturities, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions, including inflation;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•the future performance of our businesses;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•unanticipated actions from the Federal Reserve; •market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•investor willingness to invest in companies associated with fossil fuels; •our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant securities laws.18The Registrants’ current credit ratings and any changes in credit ratings in 2021 and to date in 2022 are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be reduced or withdrawn by a rating agency. The Registrants note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold their securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms. An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment could reduce our earnings.Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2020, CenterPoint Energy identified and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $185 million in the Indiana Electric reporting unit. No impairments to goodwill were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Should the annual goodwill impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity, increasing balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A non-cash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact its cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. CenterPoint Energy has approximately $828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31, 2021. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($38 million in the aggregate, or $2.65 per ZENS, as of December 31, 2021) or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  CenterPoint Energy’s ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31, 2021, deferred taxes of approximately $539 million would have been payable in 2021, based on 2021 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2021 to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $146 million would have been payable in 2021. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. This could happen if CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities shares would typically be disposed when ZENS are exchanged and ZENS-Related Securities shares are sold.Dividend requirements associated with CenterPoint Energy’s Series A Preferred Stock subject it to certain risks.CenterPoint Energy has 800,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. Any future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays, on its Series A Preferred Stock will depend on, among other things, its financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy, as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when due could materially adversely impact our ability to access capital on acceptable terms and would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, Common Stock and CenterPoint Energy’s debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy, under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock.Further, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for 19consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such shares, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energy’s capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock (as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs) upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the cost of capital related to outstanding debt and other financial instruments.LIBOR is currently the basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on variable rate loans and other securities. Each of the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities, including certain facilities or financial instruments entered into by their subsidiaries, use LIBOR as a reference rate.  The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom previously announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by 2021, but later expressed support for the extension of certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR until June 2023, as well as the replacement of LIBOR by the SOFR. Accordingly, beginning January 1, 2022, the Financial Conduct Authority ceased publishing one week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and is expected to cease publishing all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors in June 2023. The Federal Reserve has also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate. Because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from LIBOR. Any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR’s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.  Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark such as SOFR, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Each of the Registrants’ credit facilities provide for a mechanism to replace LIBOR with possible alternative benchmarks upon certain benchmark replacement events. We are still currently evaluating the impact of any such potential benchmark replacements or unavailability of LIBOR. Also, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to such potential phase-out and alternative benchmark rates or disruption in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting Electric Generation, Transmission and Distribution Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs.Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT and Indiana Electric’s rates are regulated by the IURC. Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) based on an analysis of their invested capital, their expenses and other factors in a designated test year (often either fully or partially historic). Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s control. For Houston Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required 48 months from the date of the order setting rates in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding, unless the PUCT issues an order extending the deadline to file that general base rate proceeding. For Indiana Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required prior to the expiration of its TDSIC plan, which expires on December 31, 2023. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that their respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to their rates, in full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to recover their investments below their requested levels (such as in the most recent Houston Electric general rate case), below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in their respective jurisdictions.  The rates that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time, a situation referred to as “regulatory lag.” For Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag (for example, DCRF, TCOS, TDSIC, DSMA and RCRA Mechanism), although certain of these mechanisms do not provide for recovery of operations and maintenance expenses. These adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For further information on rate case proceedings and interim rate adjustment mechanisms, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. See also “—The February 2021 Winter Storm...” below for further information.20Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery. Notwithstanding the application of such rate adjustment mechanisms, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s costs or enable them to earn their authorized return. Changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to recover their costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Houston Electric or Indiana Electric and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.   Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties or Indiana Electric or directives issued by regulatory authorities could cause interruptions in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to provide transmission and distribution services and adversely affect their reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Houston Electric owns the transmission and distribution infrastructure that delivers electric power to its customers, but it does not own or operate any power generation facilities. As allowed by a new law enacted by the Texas legislature after the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, Houston Electric is now leasing mobile generation units that can provide temporary emergency electric energy and aid in restoring power to some customers during certain widespread power outages that are impacting its distribution system. In February 2021, the ERCOT regulated Texas electric system experienced extreme winter weather conditions and an unprecedented power generation shortage. The amount of electricity generated by the state’s power generation companies was insufficient to meet the amount demanded by customers. This resulted in ERCOT directing TDUs to significantly Load Shed, which caused outages across the ERCOT electric grid of Texas, including in Houston Electric’s service territory. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. If power generation capacity is severely disrupted again or is inadequate for any reason, or if ERCOT needs to issue directives to TDUs (such as Houston Electric) to Load Shed, Houston Electric’s transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted; it could have claims and litigation filed against it; and its reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For more information, see “— Houston Electric’s use of temporary ...” and “— The February 2021 Winter Storm ...” Similarly, while Indiana Electric generates power, it is also party to a number of PPAs with third parties. Indiana Electric’s power generation may be disrupted or otherwise insufficient, if third parties do not deliver required power under our PPAs, power generation capacity is inadequate or MISO issues directives to its members (such as Indiana Electric) to implement controlled outages as a result of an emergency or due to reliability issues. If such disruptions were to occur, Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted; it could have claims and litigation filed against it; and its reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Additionally, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased purchase power costs and inadvertent releases of coal ash and/or other contaminants with a significant environmental impact. These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns or malfunctions due to equipment failure or operator error; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; or natural disasters, all of which could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s business. Further, Indiana Electric currently relies on coal for substantially all of its generation capacity. Currently, Indiana Electric purchases substantially all of its coal supply from a single, unrelated party and, although the coal supply is under long-term contract, the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In 2021, Indiana Electric experienced coal supply shortages due to labor shortages that the coal industry is experiencing. While the coal supply shortage that Indiana Electric experienced did not impact its ability to deliver electricity to its customers, labor shortages as well as supply shortages in the future, whether caused by insufficient supply or supplier bankruptcy or other regulatory and supply issues in the mining industry, may lead to increased cost and have a material adverse impact on our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See “— Continued disruptions to the supply...” Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity. As of December 31, 2021, Houston Electric provided electric delivery service to approximately 59 REPs. Adverse economic 21conditions, such as the impact of COVID-19, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT, inflation or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Houston Electric’s PUCT-approved tariff outlines the remedies available to Houston Electric in the event that a REP defaults on amounts owed.  Among the remedies available to Houston Electric are seeking recourse against any cash deposit, letter of credit, or surety bond provided by the REP or implementing mutually agreeable terms with the REP.  Another remedy is to require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort.  Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2021 was $207 million. Approximately 40% and 18% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If a REP was unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made regarding prior payments Houston Electric had received from such REP. For example, following the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, multiple REPs filed for bankruptcy. We are currently capturing the amounts owed by the REPs as a permitted regulatory asset for bad debt expenses, which will be subject to a reasonableness review by the PUCT when we seek recovery in our next base rate case.Indiana Electric’s execution of its generation transition plan, including its IRP, are subject to various risks, including timely recovery of capital investments and increased costs and risks related to the timing and cost of development and/or construction of new generation facilities. Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP every three years, unless extended, to the IURC that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period on a periodic basis. In February 2018, as part of its electric generation transition plan, Indiana Electric received approval from the IURC to construct a 50 MW universal solar array and a plan to retrofit its largest, most efficient coal-fired generation unit (Culley Unit 3). With respect to its 2019/2020 IRP submitted to the IURC in June 2020, Indiana Electric identified a preferred generation resource that includes the replacement of 730 MW of coal-fired generation facilities with a significant portion composed of renewables, including solar and wind, supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines, including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation, as well as storage. While the IURC does not approve or reject the IRP, the process involves the issuance of a staff report that provides comments on the IRP. On November 17, 2021, Indiana Electric received the staff report on the IRP. Further, there is no guarantee that the IURC will approve the requests included in any of Indiana Electric’s future filed petitions relating to its IRP. Even if a generation project is approved, risks associated with the development or construction of any new generation exist, including new legislation restricting or delaying new generation, moratorium legislation, the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, scarcity of resources and labor, ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation, the effects of potential construction delays, project scope changes, and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements.  For example, we, along with our developers of the Posey solar project, have recently announced plans to downsize the Posey solar project from 300 MW to 200 MW due to supply chain issues experienced in the energy industry, the rising cost of commodities and community feedback.  For additional information, see “— Continued disruptions to the supply...”  Furthermore, we have announced our intent to acquire and/or develop additional solar and wind facilities as part of our capital plan.  However, we have not yet entered into definitive agreements with developers for the acquisition and/or development of such additional projects, and we face significant competition with other bidders for a limited number of such generation facilities that developers plan to construct, including those that are in an acceptable position on the MISO interconnection queue.  As a result, suitable generation facility project candidates may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, or the expected benefits of a completed facility may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we are unable to complete or acquire such generation facilities, or if they do not perform as anticipated, our future growth, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, as a member of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, could be subject to higher costs for system improvements, as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of FERC mandatory reliability standards.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions. As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems. In addition, the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO, respectively. The FERC has designated the NERC as the 22ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a Delaware non-profit corporation. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures, which may not be fully recoverable in rates. While Houston Electric and Indiana Electric have received minor fines in the past for noncompliance, if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards again, they would be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which could range as high as over a million dollars per violation per day, and non-monetary penalties, such as having to file a mitigation plan to prevent recurrence of a similar violation and having certain milestones in such plan tracked. In connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, there have been calls for reform of the Texas electric market, some measure of which, if implemented, could have material adverse impacts on Houston Electric.Various governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and the efforts made by various entities to prepare for, and respond to, this event, including the electricity generation shortfall issues. Such agencies and entities include the United States Congress, FERC, NERC, Texas RE, ERCOT, Texas government entities and officials such as the Texas Governor’s office, the Texas Legislature, the Texas Attorney General, the PUCT, the City of Houston and other municipal and county entities in Houston Electric’s service area, among other entities. In addition to questions around preparation and response, some federal and other officials, as well as members of the public and media, have called for reviews and reforms of the Texas electric market, including whether it should continue to be governed by ERCOT or instead be subject to FERC jurisdiction and regulation by joining an ISO such as MISO, as well as the division of the market between power generators, TDUs (such as Houston Electric) and REPs. There are significant uncertainties around these discussions and whether any market structure or governance changes will result therefrom, but if any such reviews and reform efforts ultimately result in changes to how the Texas electric market is structured or regulated, such changes could have a material adverse impact on Houston Electric’s business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—The February 2021 Winter Storm...” below and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.   Houston Electric’s use of temporary mobile generation resources is subject to various risks, including related failure to obtain and deploy sufficient mobile generation units, potential performance issues and allegations about Houston Electric’s deployment of the resources (including the planning, execution, and effectiveness of the same), regulatory and environmental requirements, and timely recovery of capital. Following the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, the Texas legislature passed a new law, effective September 1, 2021, that allows TDUs, like Houston Electric, to lease and operate temporary back-up generation resources during widespread power outages where ERCOT has ordered a TDU to shed load or the TDU’s distribution facilities are not being fully served by the bulk power system under normal operations. In response to this legislation, Houston Electric has entered into short-term and long-term leases with a third party provider to obtain mobile generation units. However, if Houston Electric is otherwise unable to deploy a sufficient number of mobile generation units in time to respond to a particular event; if the mobile generation units fail to perform as intended; if Houston Electric is otherwise unable to provide back-up generation resources and restore power as intended; or if the use of mobile generation units or their failure to perform causes or is alleged to cause any personal injury, property damage, or other damage or loss due to allegations that it failed to deploy such units reasonably or effectively and failed to respond to particular power outages, Houston Electric could be subject to claims, demands, litigation, liability, regulatory scrutiny, and loss of reputation.  As noted above, the legislation prescribes specific and limited use for the mobile generation units, and Houston Electric’s mobile generation units have limited generation capacity, such that in future events customers could still be without power despite deployment of the mobile units. While Houston Electric has insurance coverage and indemnity rights for its use of mobile generation units, if its insurers or indemnitors fail to meet their indemnity obligations, Houston Electric could be liable for personal injury, property damage, or other damage or loss. Further, the mobile generation units are subject to various environmental regulations and permitting requirements, which could have an impact on Houston Electric’s ability to use these units, and noncompliance with which could subject Houston Electric to further potential liability.  The use of mobile generation units is also subject to various requirements of the new legislation, and failure to comply with them could subject Houston Electric to additional liability as well as challenges to its use of mobile generation in general.  While Houston Electric will seek to recover the costs of the lease and use of mobile generation units, such recovery is not certain, and Houston Electric’s inability to recover its costs could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For further information, see “— Rate Regulation of Houston Electric’s...”, “— Our insurance coverage may not...” and “— We are subject to operational...”  23Risk Factors
 Affecting Natural Gas’ Business (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)Rate regulation of Natural Gas may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs.Natural Gas’ rates are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions based on an analysis of Natural Gas’ invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic) in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment. Each of these proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Natural Gas’ control. During 2022, Natural Gas has a pending rate case and a proceeding considering recovery of extraordinary natural gas costs during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event in Minnesota. In the Minnesota extraordinary natural gas cost proceeding, various parties have proposed significant disallowances for all natural gas utilities ranging from $45 million to $409 million for CenterPoint Energy and CERC.  Natural Gas can make no assurance that these respective base rate and cost recovery proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates, full or adequate cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. These base rate proceedings could cause Natural Gas to recover its investments at rates below its requested level, the national average for utilities or recently approved levels for other utilities in those jurisdictions.The rates that Natural Gas is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.” For example, the MPUC has ordered that the amortization period for extraordinary gas costs resulting from the February 2021 Winter Storm Event be increased from 27-months to 63-months beginning on January 1, 2022, and that CERC forego recovery of the associated carrying costs. Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by Natural Gas to reduce the effects of regulatory lag (for example, CSIA, DRR, GRIP, RRA and RSP), such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval, which we cannot assure would be approved, and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce or otherwise impede Natural Gas’ ability to adjust its rates or result in rates below those requested by Natural Gas.Natural Gas can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Natural Gas’ costs or enable Natural Gas to earn an expected return. Changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Natural Gas’ ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Natural Gas and deny the full recovery of Natural Gas’ cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Natural Gas to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For further information on rate case proceedings and interim rate adjustment mechanisms, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.Unlike CERC, Indiana Gas, SIGECO’s natural gas distribution business and VEDO must seek approval by the IURC and PUCO, as applicable, for long-term financing authority. This authority allows these utilities the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or PUCO do not approve these utilities’ respective financing authorities, they may not be able to fully execute their financing plans and their respective financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Regulatory Matters.” Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for Natural Gas’ customers.Natural Gas depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. Substantially all of Natural Gas’ natural gas supply is purchased from intrastate and interstate pipelines. If Natural Gas is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet Natural Gas’ requirements, the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in Natural Gas’ service territories could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather conditions, acts of terrorism or cyberattacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, 24could also adversely affect Natural Gas’ businesses. Further, to the extent that Natural Gas’ natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then Natural Gas’ operations could be negatively affected. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see “—The February 2021 Winter Storm...” below and Note 7 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.Natural Gas is subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices, which could affect the ability of its suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or may impact our operations which could adversely affect CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Natural Gas is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas. Increases in natural gas prices might affect Natural Gas’ ability to collect balances due from customers and could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which Natural Gas operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that Natural Gas’ suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see “—The February 2021 Winter Storm...” below and Note 7 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas, which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see “—The February 2021 Winter Storm...” below and Note 7 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.Natural Gas must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas delivered and have an adverse impact on CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Natural Gas competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with Natural Gas for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass Natural Gas’ facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas delivered by Natural Gas as a result of competition with alternate energy sources may have an adverse impact on CERC’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting Energy Systems Group’s Business (CenterPoint Energy)Energy Systems Group’s operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.Energy Systems Group’s business results are dependent on a number of factors. The industry in which Energy Systems Group operates is competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should Energy Systems Group be unsuccessful in bidding contracts (for example, federal Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts), results of operations could be impacted. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by Energy Systems Group operate could adversely impact operating results. Additionally, Energy Systems Group’s business is subject to other risks including, but not limited to, the following: the discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs; the inability of customers to finance projects; failure to appropriately design, construct or operate projects; increased project delays and backlogs, particularly in the federal sector, increases in costs and shortages in supply materials due to the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors; cancellation of projects by customers or reductions in the scope of the projects; and obligations related to warranties, guarantees and other contractual and legal obligations. 25Energy Systems Group’s business has performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by CenterPoint Energy. In the normal course of business, Energy Systems Group issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations. As the parent company, CenterPoint Energy or Vectren has, and will, from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries’ commitments. These guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations; rather, they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral. Neither CenterPoint Energy nor Vectren has been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees to date. Risk Factors
 Affecting Our BusinessesWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations, including regulation of CCR and climate change legislation. We could also experience reduced demand for our services, including certain local initiatives to prohibit new natural gas service and increase electrification initiatives in jurisdictions served by Natural Gas.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric generating facilities and electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, including among others, restricting the use of fossil fuels through future climate legislation or regulation, restricting the use of natural gas-fired appliances in new homes, limiting airborne emissions from generating facilities, restricting the way we manage wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions and requiring remedial action or monitoring to mitigate environmental actions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. We may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean, restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment. In April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electric’s generating plants will continue to be beneficially reused. In July 2018, the EPA released its final CCR Rule Phase I Reconsideration which extended the deadline to October 31, 2020 for ceasing placement of ash in ponds that exceed groundwater protections standards or that fail to meet location restrictions. In August 2019, the EPA proposed additional “Part A” amendments to its CCR Rule with respect to beneficial reuse of ash and other materials. Further “Part B” amendments, which related to alternate liners for CCR surface impoundments and the surface impoundment closure process, were published in March 2020. The Part A amendments were finalized in August 2020, and the Part B amendments were finalized in November 2020 and extended the deadline to cease placement of ash in ponds to April 11, 2021. The EPA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on legacy CCR surface impoundments in October 2020, and in December 2020 provided new data and requested public comment as part of the Agency’s reconsideration of its definition of beneficial reuse. The Part A amendments do not restrict Indiana Electric’s current beneficial reuse of its fly ash. The potential effects of future amendments to the CCR Rule are uncertain at this time.Regulatory agencies have also adopted, and from time to time consider adopting, new legislation and/or modifying existing laws and regulations to reduce GHGs. There continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation. The EPA has expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements, which could also lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, which is expected to continue under the Biden administration. For example, shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change, as well as an executive order requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration. The Biden administration also issued a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule. President Biden also recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement, which can be expected to drive a renewed regulatory push to require further GHG emission reductions from the energy sector and proceeded to lead negotiations at the global climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. On April 22, 2021, President Biden announced new goals of 50% reduction of economy-wide GHG emissions and 26100% carbon-free electricity by 2035, which formed the basis of the United States’ commitments announced in Glasgow. Reentry into the Paris Agreement, revised climate commitments coming out of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Glasgow, Scotland and President Biden’s executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. Potential future restrictions include, among other things, the United States enacting additional GHG regulations and mandated financial, emissions and other disclosures. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, Natural Gas’ revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or that would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services. For further discussion, see “Business—Environmental Matters” in Item 1 and “ —Natural Gas must compete with...” Evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation and natural gas businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy’s financing arrangements. Further, some investors may choose to not invest in CenterPoint Energy due to CenterPoint Energy’s use of fossil fuels. Also, certain cities in CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas operational footprint have adopted initiatives to prohibit the construction of new natural gas facilities that would provide service and focus on electrification. For example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas. Also, Minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. Certain state and local governments in states such as New York and California have also passed, or are considering, legislation banning the use of natural gas-fired appliances in new homes, which could affect consumer use of natural gas. Should such bans be enacted within Natural Gas’ operational footprint, they could adversely affect consumer demand for natural gas. Any such initiatives and legislation could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations.CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities associated with the implementation of and efforts to achieve its carbon emission reduction goals.In September 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its new net zero emission goals for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 and a 20-30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2035 as compared to 2021 levels. CenterPoint Energy’s analysis and plan for execution requires it to make a number of assumptions. These goals and underlying assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees. Should one or more of CenterPoint Energy’s underlying assumptions prove incorrect, its actual results and ability to achieve net zero emissions by 2035 could differ materially from its expectations. Certain of the assumptions that could impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its net zero emissions goals include, but are not limited to: emission levels, service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with expectations; regulatory approval of Indiana Electric’s generation transition plan; impacts of future environmental regulations or legislation; impact of future carbon pricing regulations or legislation, including a future carbon tax; price, availability and regulation of carbon offsets; price of fuel, such as natural gas; cost of energy generation technologies, such as wind and solar, natural gas and storage solutions; adoption of alternative energy by the public, including adoption of electric vehicles; rate of technology innovation with regards to alternative energy resources; CenterPoint Energy’s ability to implement its modernization plans for its pipelines and facilities; the ability to complete and implement generation alternatives to Indiana Electric’s coal generation and retirement dates of Indiana Electric’s coal facilities by 2035; the ability to construct and/or permit new natural gas pipelines; the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, the lack of or scarcity of resources and labor, any project cancellations, construction delays or overruns and the ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation; impact of any supply chain disruptions; changes in applicable standards or methodologies; and enhancement of energy efficiencies. Our businesses may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.Developing and implementing plans for compliance with voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. To the extent that we believe any of these costs are recoverable in rates, cost recovery could be resisted 27by our regulators and our regulators might attempt to deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Moreover, we cannot predict the ultimate impact of achieving our emissions reduction goals, or the various implementation aspects, on our system reliability or our financial condition and results of operations.Continued disruptions to the global supply chain may lead to higher prices for goods and services and impact our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute our capital plan and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The global supply chain has experienced and is expected to continue to experience disruptions due to a multitude of factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, labor shortages, resource availability, long lead time, inflation and weather, and these disruptions have adversely impacted the utility industry. We have experienced disruptions to our supply chain, as well as increased prices, and we may continue to experience this in the future. For example, we, along with the developer of the project, recently announced plans to downsize the previously announced solar array to be built in Posey County, Indiana from 300 MW to 200 MW due to supply chain issues experienced in the energy industry, the rising cost of commodities and community feedback. Additionally, we, as well as other companies in our industry, have experienced difficulties in procuring certain materials necessary for the transmission and distribution of power, such as transformers, wires, cables and meters. We may continue to experience difficulties in procuring these resources and others necessary to operate our businesses in the future, and if we were to experience other significant supply chain disruptions in the future, we may not be able to procure the resources, including labor, needed to fully execute on our ten-year capital plan or achieve our net zero emission goals. Even if we are able to procure the necessary resources, we might not be able to do so at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner which could result in project cancellations or scope changes, delays, cost overruns and under-recovery of costs. If we are unable to fully execute on capital plans as a result of supply chain disruptions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.The February 2021 Winter Storm Event caused severe disruptions in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In February 2021, certain of our jurisdictions experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event with prolonged freezing temperatures that resulted in an electricity generation shortage in our Houston Electric service area, which impacted our businesses. The electricity generation shortages necessitated ERCOT to direct TDUs, including Houston Electric, to implement controlled outages in their respective service areas. In compliance with ERCOT’s directives and emergency procedures, Houston Electric implemented controlled electricity outages across its service territory, resulting in a substantial number of its customers (on certain days over a million residents) being without power, many for extended periods of time. ERCOT has stated that the electric outages were necessary to avoid prolonged large-scale, state-wide blackouts and long-term damage to the electric system in Texas. As a result, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services were diminished or interrupted for several days. Additionally, the electricity generation shortage resulted in wholesale electricity prices increasing to their maximum allowed limit. During and in the aftermath of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, the Texas legislature revised applicable statutes and granted the PUCT and ERCOT additional regulatory authority, both oversight and enforcement, that focuses on ensuring that ERCOT market participants, including power generation facilities and TDUs (like Houston Electric), have sufficient winterization standards and protection. Houston Electric is in compliance with the requirements applicable to it. If any additional protections are required in the future, complying with these new protections may increase the cost of electricity and reduce consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers in Houston Electric’s service territory, which could adversely affect Houston Electric’s results of operations. Any potential decreases in customer usage due to higher electricity prices charged by REPs may not result in increased base rates charged by Houston Electric for its services until its next general base rate proceeding. For further information on Houston Electric’s regulatory proceedings, see “— Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s...”Furthermore, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event also impacted the wholesale prices CenterPoint Energy and CERC paid for natural gas and their ability to service customers in their Natural Gas service territories, including due to the reduction in available natural gas capacity, impacts to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas supply portfolio activities, and their ability to transport natural gas, among other things. In particular, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event also caused severe disruptions in the markets from which CenterPoint Energy and CERC sourced a significant portion of their natural gas for their utility operations, resulting in extraordinary increases in the price of natural gas to CenterPoint Energy and CERC. From February 12, 2021 to February 22, 2021, CenterPoint Energy spent approximately an incremental $2.2 billion more on natural gas supplies compared to plan. These amounts are based on final settlements of supplier and pipeline invoices from February 2021, including amounts negotiated to resolve disputes with various suppliers as of January 2022.  28In addition to the risks discussed in this risk factor, for further information on risks related to: •the arranging of future financings on acceptable terms, see “— If we are unable to...”; •the ability to receive payment from a REP, see “— Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily...” •the ability to seek recovery of the additional costs of natural gas, see “— Rate regulation of Natural Gas...”;  •access to natural gas supplies, see “— Access to natural gas supplies...”;•various regulatory, investigations, litigation or other proceedings, see “— In connection with the February...” and Note 16 to the consolidated condensed financial statements;•the fluctuations in notional natural gas prices, see “— Natural Gas is subject to...”; and•the impact of a decline in CERC’s credit rating, see “— A decline in CERC’s credit ...”Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks inherent in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and in the delivery of natural gas that could result in substantial losses or other damages. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols;•the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •information technology or financial and billing system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•failure to obtain in a timely manner and at reasonable prices the necessary fuel, such as coal and natural gas, building materials or other items needed to operate our facilities; •information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, ice storms, flooding, terrorism, wildfires, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, including any environmental impacts related thereto, which catastrophic events may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Similarly, Indiana Electric’s revenues are derived from rates it charges its customers to provide electricity. Natural Gas’ revenues are primarily derived from natural gas sales. Consequently, Houston Electric’s, Indiana Electric’s and Natural Gas’ revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity and natural gas usage, as applicable. Houston Electric’s revenues are generally higher during the warmer months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electric’s results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as in certain past years, extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. A significant portion of Indiana Electric’s sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, as in certain past years, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather, while more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. Natural Gas’ revenues are customarily higher during the winter months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish Natural Gas’ results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as occurred in certain past years, extreme cold weather conditions could increase its results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. For information related to our weather hedges, see Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see “—The February 2021 Winter Storm...” below and Note 7 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.29Climate change could adversely impact financial results from our businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events that could adversely affect our results of operations.A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories and our business. If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures than normal in our service territories, financial results from our businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, where natural gas is used to heat homes and businesses, warmer weather might result in less natural gas being used, adversely affecting us. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes and severe winter weather conditions, including ice storms, all of which may impact our operations and ability to serve our customers. To the extent the frequency and severity of extreme weather events increases, our costs of providing service may increase, including the costs and availability of procuring insurance related to such impacts, and those costs may not be recoverable. Further, events of extreme weather could make it unsafe or hinder the effectiveness of our employees to fix, maintain and restore power to affected areas and could harm our reputation. Since certain of our facilities are located along or near the Texas gulf coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers. Our electric and Natural Gas operations in our service territories were both also impacted by the February 2021 Winter Storm Event.  In the long term, climate change could also cause shifts in population, including customers moving away from our service territories. When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results are impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if recovery of such costs results in higher rates and reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Any such decreased energy use may also require us to retire current infrastructure that is no longer needed. Similarly, public and private efforts to address climate change, such as by legislation, regulation, actions by private interest groups, and litigation, could impact our ability to continue operating our businesses as we do today, significant aspects of which rely on fossil fuels. These initiatives could have a significant impact on us and our operations as well as on our third party suppliers, vendors and partners, which could impact us by among other things, causing permitting and construction delays, project cancellations or increased project costs passed on to us. In September 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its new net zero emission goals for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035 and a 20-30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2035 as compared to 2021 levels. Finally, we may be subject to climate change litigation, which could result in substantial fines, penalties or damages and restrictions on our operations. The oil and gas industry has already faced such litigation, challenging its marketing and use of fossil fuels and attributing climate change to emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels, and other industries, including ours, could face such litigation in the future.  For more information, see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, “— The February 2021 Winter Storm...” and “— CenterPoint Energy is subject to operational and financial risks...” Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets, including the failure of equipment or processes and potential breakdowns due to such aging. The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs because of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely and full recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. In addition, the nature of information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Also, our ability to successfully maintain or replace our aging infrastructure may be delayed or be at a greater cost than anticipated due to supply chain disruptions. Further, with respect to Natural Gas’ operations, if certain pipeline replacements (for example, cast-iron or bare steel pipe) are not completed timely or successfully, government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires, explosions or leaks. Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event that a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Finally, aging infrastructure may complicate our utility operations ability to address climate change concerns and efforts to enhance resiliency and reliability. See “— Continued disruptions to the supply...” Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change. We operate businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant investments and expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar, 30microturbines, fuel cells), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce energy consumption and waste. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, including Indiana Electric’s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner, to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend, in part, on our management’s ability to implement our business strategies successfully and realize the anticipated benefits therefrom. From time to time we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, such as our recently completed sale of our Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma and the recently completed Enable Merger and subsequent sale of Energy Transfer Common Units and Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings. However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions or dispositions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we are unable to make acquisitions, or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our future growth may be adversely affected. Further, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.    We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors such as changes in customers’ perceptions from incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic, climate and market conditions in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives, use of alternative technologies and changes in our customers’ perceptions regarding natural gas usage as a result of incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, including population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. Declines in demand for electricity and natural gas in our service territories due to pipeline incidents of other utilities, increased electricity and natural gas prices as experienced during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and economic downturns, among other factors, could reduce overall usage and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and natural gas. Although Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity delivered and used as a result of economic downturn or recession 31could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. A reduction in the rate of economic, employment and/or population growth could result in lower growth and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in such service territories. Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or natural gas or number of customers and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.General Risk Factors
 Affecting Our BusinessesCyberattacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our businesses, which includes, among other things, (i) managing operations and other business processes and (ii) protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. For example, the operation of our electric generation, transmission and distribution systems are dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our systems and third-party systems. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of the intelligent grid, smart devices and operational technologies across our businesses. Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyberattack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems. Similarly, our business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. For example, the operation of an efficient deregulated wholesale and retail electric market in Texas mandates communication with ERCOT, and competitive retailers; and our Indiana Electric organization has a similar relationship with MISO. Also, the distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with third-party systems. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events, such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability to conduct operations and control assets.Cyberattacks, including phishing attacks and threats from the use of malicious code such as malware, ransomware and viruses, and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us to possible legal claims and liability. While we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology, operational technology, and data systems from such attacks, our cybersecurity program does not prevent all breaches or cyberattack incidents. We have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber intrusions and attacks to our information systems and those of third parties, including vendors, suppliers, contractors and quasi government entities, like ERCOT and MISO, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information. The risk of a disruption or breach of our operational systems, or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations, through cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world. We are not fully insured against all cybersecurity risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We depend on the secure operations of our physical assets to transport the energy we deliver and our information technology to process, transmit and store electronic information, including information and operational technology we use to safely operate our energy transportation systems. Security breaches or acts of terrorism could expose our business to a risk of loss, misuse or interruption of critical physical assets or information and functions that affect our operations, as well as potential data privacy breaches and loss of protected personal information. Such losses could result in operational impacts, damage to our assets, public or personal safety incidents, damage to the environment, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, regulatory enforcement actions, litigation and a potential material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against security threats will be completely recoverable through rates. 32Compliance with and changes in cybersecurity laws and regulations have a cost and operational impact on our business, and failure to comply with such requirements could adversely impact our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, and U.S. government warnings have indicated that infrastructure assets, including pipelines and electric generation and infrastructure, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. In the second and third quarters of 2021, the TSA announced two new security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that occurred in 2021. These directives require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements. We may be required to expend significant additional resources and costs to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. There is no certainty that such costs incurred will be recovered through rates. Any failure to remain in compliance with these government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions which may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.In connection with our businesses, we and our vendors, suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information (for example, information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy is increasingly demanding. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. While we have implemented and maintain a data privacy program designed to protect personal information from any attacks, our data privacy programs does not prevent all security or privacy breaches. Some of our third party vendors who maintain personally identifiable information have experienced a breach of their data privacy. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions and other legal requirements could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We currently have insurance in place, such as general liability and property insurance, to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to fully cover or restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Costs, damages and other liabilities related to recent events and incidents that affected other utilities, such as wildfires, winter storms and explosions, among other things, have exceeded or could exceed such utilities’ insurance coverage. Further, as a result of these recent events and incidents, the marketplace for insurance coverage to utility companies may be unavailable or limited in capacity or any such available coverage may be deemed by us to be cost prohibitive under current conditions. Insurance premiums for any such coverage, if available, may not be eligible for recovery, whether in full or in part, by us through the rates charged by our utility businesses.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and insurance capacity to be limited. Historically, Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise.  In the future, any such recovery may not be granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.33We face risks related to COVID-19 and other health epidemics and outbreaks, including economic, regulatory, legal, workforce and cyber security risks, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and adversely affect current global economic activities and conditions. An extended slowdown of economic growth, decreased demand for commodities and/or material changes in governmental or regulatory policy in the United States has resulted in, and could continue to result in, lower growth and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in our service territories, particularly among our commercial and industrial customers, as customer facilities close, remain closed or potentially close again. The ability of our customers, contractors and suppliers to meet their obligations to us, including payment obligations, has also been negatively affected under the current economic conditions and previously resulted in an increase to allowance for credit losses. To the extent these conditions in our service territories persist, our bad debt expense from uncollectible accounts could continue to increase, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. REPs have and could continue to encounter financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, which could impair their ability to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments, adversely affecting Houston Electric’s cash flows and liquidity. Additionally, our state and local regulatory agencies, in response to a federal mandate or otherwise, could impose restrictions on the rates we charge to provide our services, including the inability to implement approved rates, or delay actions with respect to our rate cases and filings. The COVID-19 pandemic may affect our ability to timely satisfy regulatory requirements such as recordkeeping and/or timely reporting requirements. For further information on COVID-19 regulatory matters, please see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. Additionally, various federal, state, and local governmental entities continue to pass legislation, issue orders, and take other measures to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including vaccination, testing and masking requirements.  Some of these governmental requirements conflict with others presenting challenges to businesses like ours in interpreting, implementing, and complying with them.  Governmental requirements have also been subject to challenges in litigation, such as OSHA’s Emergency Temporary Standard, mandating vaccination for certain employers, which was recently withdrawn by OSHA after being stayed by the Supreme Court of the United States.  With respect to our supply chain, to the extent we experience such disruptions in our supply chain that limit our ability to obtain materials and equipment necessary for our businesses, whether through delayed order fulfillment, limited production or unavailability due to COVID-19, we may be unable to perform our operations timely or as anticipated, which could result in service or construction delays, project cancellations or increased costs. Furthermore, in the event key officers or a substantial portion of our workforce were to be impacted by COVID-19 for an extended period of time, we may face challenges with respect to our services or operations and we may not be able to execute our capital plan as anticipated. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 and its variants will continue to spread, even with the availability of a vaccine therefor, and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of COVID-19 and variants, such as large-scale travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns. Restrictions of this nature have caused, and may continue to cause, us, our suppliers and other business counterparties to experience operational delays, shortages of employees, materials and equipment, facility shutdowns or business closures. As appropriate, based on conditions, we have modified certain business and workforce practices (including those related to employee travel, employee work locations and participation in meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. However, the quarantine of personnel or the inability to access our facilities or customer sites could adversely affect our operations. While certain of our personnel have been, and may continue to be, quarantined, our operations and corporate functions have not been significantly adversely affected to date. As of the date of this Form 10-K, the vast majority of our workforce works from their regular work locations. As appropriate, we have adjusted our operational protocols to minimize exposure and risk to our field personnel, customers and the communities we serve, while continuing to maintain the work activities necessary for safe and reliable service to our customers. Even with increased safety precautions, we cannot assure that such adjustments and precautions will be sufficient to minimize exposure to and risk from COVID-19. Also, we have a limited number of highly skilled employees for some of our operations. If a large proportion of our employees in those critical positions were to contract COVID-19 at the same time, we would rely upon our business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations at our facilities, but there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the adverse impact to our operations that could result from shortages of highly skilled employees. Additionally, in the event that customers, contractors, employees or others were to allege that they contracted COVID-19 because of actions we took or failed to take, we could face claims, lawsuits and potential legal liability. In addition to the reasonableness of our actions and efforts to comply with applicable COVID-19 guidance, our exposure and ultimate liability would depend upon the applicability of workers’ compensation, the availability of insurance coverage and limitations on liability being considered or enacted at the state and federal level. For more information, see “— Continued disruptions to the supply...” 34Experts have observed an increase in the volume and the sophistication of cyberattacks since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any technology system breaches and/or data privacy incidents could disrupt our operations or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or company information and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For those employees and third-party service providers who continue to work remotely, we face heightened cyber security and privacy risks related to unauthorized system access, aggressive social engineering tactics and adversaries attacking the information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct our business. The increase in the remote working arrangements of our employees initially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic required enhancements and modifications to our information technology infrastructure (for example, virtual private network, or VPN, and remote collaboration systems), and any failures of these technologies, including third-party service providers, that facilitate working remotely could limit our ability to conduct our ordinary operations and expose us to increased risk or impact of a cyberattack. See “— Cyberattacks, physical security breaches, acts...”We will continue to monitor developments affecting our employees, customers and operations. At this time, however, we cannot predict the extent or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or its future effects on national, state and local economies, including the impact on our ability to access capital markets, our supply chain, our business strategies and plans and our workforce, nor can we estimate the potential adverse impact from COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Other future epidemics and outbreaks may result in potential adverse impacts similar to, or worse than, those from COVID-19. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. Further tightening of the labor market and increasing wages to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain good labor relations could adversely impact the operations of our facilities and our results of operations.Our businesses are dependent on recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. Like many companies in the utilities industry and other industries, we have experienced higher than normal turnover of employees as a result of a number of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, a tightening labor market, increasing remote working opportunities, employees shifting industries, individuals deciding not to work and a maturing workforce. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our businesses, particularly the specialized skills and knowledge required to construct and operate generation facilities, a technology-enabled power grid and transmission and distribution facilities, among other facilities. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our ability to execute on our 10-year capital plan and our results of operations could be negatively affected.Furthermore, the operations of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees, and several of our businesses have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions, comprising approximately 37% of our workforce. We have several separate bargaining units, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described further in Note 8(j) to the consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. The collective bargaining agreements with USW Locals 13-227, USW Locals 13-1 and IBEW Local 702 related to Natural Gas and CenterPoint Energy employees are scheduled to expire in June 2022, July 2022 and June 2022, respectively, and negotiations of these agreements are expected to be completed before the respective expirations. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and cash flows.35Changing demographics, poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees. Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, contributions to the plan, the number of plan participants and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations, or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements, these factors could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.We may be significantly affected by changes in federal income tax laws and regulations, including any comprehensive federal tax reform legislation.Our businesses are impacted by U.S. federal income tax policy. Under the current administration with the Senate and House of Representatives controlled by the Democratic Party, comprehensive federal tax reform legislation could be enacted that may significantly change the federal income tax laws applicable to domestic businesses, including changes that may increase the federal income tax rate and impact investment incentives and deductions for depreciation and interest, among other deductions. While CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries cannot assess the overall impact of any such potential legislation on our businesses, it is possible that our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, with any enacted federal tax reform legislation, it is uncertain how state commissions and local municipalities may require us to respond to the effects of such tax legislation, including determining the treatment of EDIT and other increases and decreases in our revenue requirements. As such, potential regulatory actions in response to any enacted tax legislation could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and recent trends suggest that jury verdicts and other liability have been increasing, and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Additionally, under some circumstances, the Registrants could potentially have claims filed against them or incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them as a result of sales, divestitures or other transfers to third parties who may be unable to fulfill their indemnity obligations to the Registrants. Final resolution of these matters, or any potential future claims or liabilities, may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial results.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, including as part of our Ethics and Compliance program’s efforts to detect misconduct, we become aware of and expect to continue to become aware of instances of employee misconduct, which we investigate, remediate and disclose as appropriate and proportionate to the incident"
7,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2021-02-25,"Risk Factors
 CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric, CERC, SIGECO, Indiana Gas and VEDO. CenterPoint Energy also owns interests in Enable. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10-K, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company, the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries and its interests in Enable. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s businesses. For other factors that may cause actual 20results to differ from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this combined report on Form 10-K, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings” in Item 7, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in this Item 1A. Carefully consider each of the risks described below, including those relating to Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined report on Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its subsidiaries. Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionCenterPoint Energy is a holding company with no operations or operating assets of its own. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and from Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions. CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from, and holds all of its assets through, its subsidiaries, including its interests in Enable. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. In general, CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ and Enable’s ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy, and its subsidiaries or Enable could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make payments or other distributions. Further, Houston Electric has agreed to certain “ring-fencing” measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy. Further ring-fencing measures could be imposed on Houston Electric in the future through legislation or PUCT rules or orders. While current ring-fencing measures have not impacted Houston Electric’s ability to pay dividends to CenterPoint Energy, the imposition of any additional ring-fencing measures impacting CenterPoint Energy’s ability to receive dividends from Houston Electric could materially adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. CenterPoint Energy’s right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by CenterPoint Energy.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive, and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures. For example, we depend on (i) long-term debt, (ii) borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and, for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, commercial paper programs, (iii) distributions from CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable and (iv) if market conditions permit, issuances of additional shares of common or preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy. We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures. As of December 31, 2020, CenterPoint Energy had $13.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $747 million of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. For information on outstanding indebtedness of Houston Electric and CERC as well as maturities through 2025, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enable’s units or volatility in Enable’s unit price;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•the future performance of our and Enable’s businesses;•integration of Vectren’s businesses into CenterPoint Energy, including technology systems;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant securities laws.21In addition, our future financing activities may also be impacted by our ability to consummate the proposed sale of our Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma. For further information on the proposed sale, see “— Our potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows” below. With respect to impacts related to our investment in Enable, see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the recently announced Enable Merger.The Registrants’ current credit ratings and any changes in credit ratings in 2020 and to date in 2021 are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. The Registrants note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold their securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms. An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment to CenterPoint Energy’s Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment could reduce our earnings.Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. During the year ended December 31, 2020, CenterPoint Energy identified and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $185 million in the Indiana Electric reporting unit, reducing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value as of March 31, 2020. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. CenterPoint Energy identified and recorded an impairment during the year ended December 31, 2020 based on the severity of the decline in Enable’s common unit price during the three months ended March 31, 2020 due to the macroeconomic conditions related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with Enable’s announcement on April 1, 2020 to reduce its quarterly distributions per common unit by 50%, and the market outlook indicating excess supply of crude oil and natural gas and continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry. For further information regarding CenterPoint Energy’s impairment of its equity investment in Enable, please see Notes 10 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements. Should the annual goodwill impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction, including for the Series A Preferred Unit investment, indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A sustained or severe decline in Enable’s common unit price could result in CenterPoint Energy recording impairment charges again in the future. A non-cash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact its cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. CenterPoint Energy has approximately $828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31, 2020. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($56 million in the aggregate, or $3.97 per ZENS, as of December 31, 2020) or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  CenterPoint Energy’s ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31, 2020, deferred taxes of approximately $471 million would have been payable in 2020, based on 2020 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2020 to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $159 million would have been payable in 2020. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. This could happen if CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow 22because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities shares would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged and ZENS-Related Securities shares are sold.Dividend requirements associated with CenterPoint Energy’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock subject it to certain risks.CenterPoint Energy has issued 800,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 19,550,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of CenterPoint Energy’s Series B Preferred Stock, which is expected to convert into Common Stock on September 1, 2021. CenterPoint Energy has also issued 725,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock of which 625,000 shares remain outstanding. The Series C Preferred Stock are expected to convert to Common Stock on or around May 7, 2021. Any future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays, on its Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock will depend on, among other things, its financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and Enable to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy, as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock when due could materially adversely impact our ability to access capital on acceptable terms and would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, Common Stock and CenterPoint Energy’s debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy, under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock.Further, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such shares, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energy’s capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock or its Series B Preferred Stock (as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs) upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the cost of capital related to outstanding debt and other financial instruments and may adversely affect the cash distributions received from the Enable Series A Preferred Units.LIBOR is the basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on variable rate loans and other securities. Each of the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities, including certain facilities or financial instruments entered into by their subsidiaries, use LIBOR as a reference rate. Additionally, on and after February 18, 2021, Enable is expected to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units with an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 8.5%.  On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, the Financial Conduct Authority announced its support for the extension of certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR until June 2023, as well as the replacement of LIBOR by the SOFR. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new U.S. dollar LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repo financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from LIBOR.. It is unclear whether other new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The future of LIBOR at this time remains uncertain and any changes in the methods by which LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to LIBOR’s phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or cease to exist.  Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Each of the Registrants’ credit facilities provide for a mechanism to replace LIBOR with possible alternative benchmarks upon certain benchmark replacement events. However, we are still currently evaluating the impact of any such potential benchmark replacements or unavailability of LIBOR. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative benchmark rates or disruption in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.23Risk Factors
 Affecting Electric Generation, Transmission and Distribution Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs.Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT and Indiana Electric’s rates are regulated by the IURC. Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) based on an analysis of their invested capital, their expenses and other factors in a designated test year. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s control. For Houston Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required 48 months from the date of the order setting rates in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding, unless the PUCT issues an order extending the deadline to file that general base rate proceeding. For Indiana Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required prior to the expiration of its TDSIC plan, which expires on December 31, 2023. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that their respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to their rates, in full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to recover their investments below their requested levels (such as in the most recent Houston Electric general rate case), below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in their respective jurisdictions.  The rates that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time, a situation referred to as “regulatory lag.” For Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag (for example, DCRF, TCOS, TDSIC, DSMA and RCRA Mechanism), although certain of these mechanisms do not provide for recovery of operations and maintenance expenses. These adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For further information on rate case proceedings and interim rate adjustment mechanisms, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. See also “—The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” below for further information.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery. Notwithstanding the application of such rate adjustment mechanisms, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s costs or enable them to earn an expected return. Changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to recover their costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Houston Electric or Indiana Electric and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.   Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties or directives issued by regulatory authorities could interrupt Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services and adversely affect its reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities. In February 2021, the Texas electric system experienced an unprecedented power shortage due to extreme winter weather conditions. The state’s power generation fell short of demand, resulting in significant electricity outages across Texas, including in Houston Electric’s service territory. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the February 2021 Winter Storm Event. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate or if ERCOT issues directives to TDUs (such as Houston Electric) to implement controlled outages, both of which recently occurred during the February 2021 Winter Weather Event, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. See also “—The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and 24could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” below for further information.Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2020, Houston Electric did business with approximately 64 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, including the impact of COVID-19, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2020 was $210 million. Approximately 31% and 16% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP.  Indiana Electric’s execution of its generation transition plan, including its IRP, and its regulated power supply operations are subject to various risks, including timely recovery of capital investments, increased costs and facility outages or shutdowns. Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP every three years, unless extended, to the IURC that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period on a periodic basis. Indiana Electric’s 2016 IRP modeling projected that the lowest cost and least risk generation portfolio to serve customers over the next 20 years involve retirement of a significant portion of its current generating fleet and replacing that generation capacity with other resources. Implementation of Indiana Electric’s IRP will likely require recovery of new capital investments, as well as costs of retiring the current generation fleet, including any remaining unrecovered costs of retired assets. In February 2018, as part of its electric generation transition plan, Indiana Electric received approval from the IURC to construct a 50 MW universal solar array and the plan to retrofit its largest, most efficient coal-fired generation unit (Culley Unit 3). With respect to its 2019/2020 IRP submitted to the IURC in June 2020, Indiana Electric identified a preferred generation resource that includes the replacement of 730 MW of coal-fired generation facilities with a significant portion composed of renewables, including solar and wind, supported by dispatchable natural gas combustion turbines, including a pipeline to serve such natural gas generation, as well as storage. While the IURC does not approve or reject the IRP, the process involves the issuance of a staff report that provides comments on the IRP. Depending on comments received on the IRP, the filing of any future requests for generating facilities could be delayed. Further, certain legislative activities such as a prohibition on the construction of new generation assets in excess of a set MW capacity, similar to moratorium legislation introduced in 2019 and ultimately defeated, or other legislation restricting or delaying new generation could negatively affect Indiana Electric’s ability to construct new generation facilities and execution of its capital plan. Even if a generation project is approved, risks associated with the construction of any new generation exist, including the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, scarcity of resources and labor, ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation, the effects of potential construction delays and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements. Further, there is no guarantee that the IURC will approve the requests included in any of Indiana Electric’s future filed petitions relating to its IRP. For further information on the IRP, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.Additionally, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased purchase power costs and inadvertent releases of coal ash and/or other contaminants with a significant environmental impact. These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns or malfunctions due to equipment failure or operator error; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; or natural disasters, all of which could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s business. Further, Indiana Electric currently relies on coal for substantially all of its generation capacity. Currently, its coal supply is purchased largely from a 25single, unrelated party and, although the coal supply is under long-term contract, the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, as a member of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, could be subject to higher costs for system improvements, as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of FERC mandatory reliability standards.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions. As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems. In addition, the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO, respectively. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a Delaware non-profit corporation. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures, which may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. In connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, there have been calls for reform of the Texas electric market, which, if implemented, could have material adverse impacts on Houston Electric.Various governmental and regulatory agencies and other entities have called for or are conducting inquiries and investigations into the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and the efforts made by various entities to prepare for, and respond to, this event, including the electricity generation shortfall issues. Agencies and entities that may conduct or are conducting such inquiries, investigations and other reviews include the United States Congress, FERC, NERC, Texas RE, ERCOT, Texas government entities and officials such as the Texas Governor’s office, the Texas Legislature, the Texas Attorney General, the PUCT, the City of Houston and other municipal and county entities in Houston Electric’s service area, among other entities. In addition to questions around preparation and response, some federal and other officials, as well as members of the public and media, have called for reviews and reforms of the Texas electric market, including whether it should continue to be governed by ERCOT or instead be subject to FERC jurisdiction and regulation by joining an ISO such as MISO, as well as the division of the market between power generators, TDUs (such as Houston Electric) and REPs. There are significant uncertainties around these discussions and whether any market structure or governance changes will result therefrom, but if any such reviews and reform efforts ultimately result in changes to how the Texas electric market is structured or regulated, such changes could have a material adverse impact on Houston Electric’s business, results of operations and financial condition. See “—The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” below and Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.   Risk Factors
 Affecting Natural Gas’ Business (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)Rate regulation of Natural Gas may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs.Natural Gas’ rates are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions based on an analysis of Natural Gas’ invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic) in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment. Each of these proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Natural Gas’ control. Natural Gas has pending, or anticipates the filing of, rate cases in Indiana and Minnesota during 2021. Natural Gas can make no assurance that these respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates, full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings could cause Natural Gas to recover its investments at rates below its requested level, below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in those jurisdictions.The rates that Natural Gas is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.” Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by Natural Gas to reduce the effects of regulatory lag (for example, GRIP, FRP, CSIA and DRR), such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval, which we cannot assure would be 26approved, and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce or otherwise impede Natural Gas’ ability to adjust its rates or result in rates below those requested by Natural Gas.Natural Gas can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Natural Gas’ costs or enable Natural Gas to earn an expected return. Changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Natural Gas’ ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Natural Gas and deny the full recovery of Natural Gas’ cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Natural Gas to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. For further information on rate case proceedings and interim rate adjustment mechanisms, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.Unlike CERC, Indiana Gas, SIGECO’s natural gas distribution business and VEDO must seek approval by the IURC and PUCO, as applicable, for long-term financing authority. This authority allows these utilities the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or PUCO do not approve these utilities’ respective financing authorities, they may not be able to fully execute their financing plans and their respective financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for Natural Gas’ customers.Natural Gas depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. Substantially all of Natural Gas’ natural gas supply is purchased from intrastate and interstate pipelines. If Natural Gas is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet Natural Gas’ requirements, the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in Natural Gas’ service territories could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, severe winter weather conditions, acts of terrorism or cyberattacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, could also adversely affect Natural Gas’ businesses. Further, to the extent that Natural Gas’ natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then Natural Gas’ operations could be negatively affected. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see “—The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” below and Note 22 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.Natural Gas is subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices, which could affect the ability of its suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. Natural Gas is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas. Increases in natural gas prices might affect Natural Gas’ ability to collect balances due from customers and could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which Natural Gas operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that Natural Gas’ suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see “—The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” below and Note 22 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.27A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas, which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see “—The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” below and Note 22 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.Natural Gas must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas delivered and have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Natural Gas competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with Natural Gas for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass Natural Gas’ facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas delivered by Natural Gas as a result of competition with alternate energy sources may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting ESG’s Business (CenterPoint Energy)ESG’s operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.ESG’s business results are dependent on a number of factors. The industry in which ESG operates is competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should ESG be unsuccessful in bidding contracts (for example, federal Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts), results of operations could be impacted. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by ESG operate could adversely impact operating results. Additionally, ESG’s business is subject to other risks including, but not limited to, the following: the discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs; the inability of customers to finance projects; failure to appropriately design, construct or operate projects; and cancellation of projects by customers or reductions in the scope of the projects. ESG’s business has performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by CenterPoint Energy. In the normal course of business, ESG issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations. As the parent company, CenterPoint Energy has, and will, from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries’ commitments. These guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations; rather, they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral. Neither CenterPoint Energy nor Vectren has been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees. Risk Factors
 Affecting Our BusinessesWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations, including regulation of CCR and climate change legislation as well as other risks related to the implementation of our carbon emissions reduction targets. We could also experience reduced demand for our services, including certain local initiatives to prohibit new natural gas service and increase electrification initiatives in jurisdictions served by Natural Gas.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, steam electric generating facilities and electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, including among others, restricting the use of fossil fuels through future climate legislation or regulation, limiting airborne emissions from generating facilities, restricting the way we manage wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions and requiring remedial action or monitoring to mitigate environmental actions caused by our operations or attributable to former 28operations. We may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to comply with these requirements. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean, restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment. In April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non-hazardous material under the RCRA. The final rule allows beneficial reuse of ash, and the majority of the ash generated by Indiana Electric’s generating plants will continue to be beneficially reused. In July 2018, the EPA released its final CCR Rule Phase I Reconsideration which extended the deadline to October 31, 2020 for ceasing placement of ash in ponds that exceed groundwater protections standards or that fail to meet location restrictions. In August 2019, the EPA proposed additional “Part A” amendments to its CCR Rule with respect to beneficial reuse of ash and other materials. Further “Part B” amendments, which related to alternate liners for CCR surface impoundments and the surface impoundment closure process, were published in March 2020. The Part A amendments were finalized in August 2020, and the Part B amendments were finalized in November 2020 and extended the deadline to cease placement of ash in ponds to April 11, 2021. The EPA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking on legacy CCR surface impoundments in October 2020, and in December 2020 provided new data and requested public comment as part of the Agency’s reconsideration of its definition of beneficial reuse. The Part A amendments do not restrict Indiana Electric’s current beneficial reuse of its fly ash. CenterPoint Energy continues to evaluate the Part B amendments to determine potential impacts. The potential effects of future amendments to the CCR Rule are uncertain at this time.Regulatory agencies have also adopted, and from time to time consider adopting, new legislation and/or modifying existing laws and regulations to reduce GHGs. There continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation. The EPA has expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements, which could also lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, which is expected to continue under the Biden administration. For example, President Biden has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement. Shortly after taking office in January 2021, President Biden also issued a series of executive orders designed to address climate change, as well as an executive order requiring agencies to review environmental actions taken by the Trump administration. The Biden administration has also issued a memorandum to departments and agencies to refrain from proposing or issuing rules until a departmental or agency head appointed or designated by the Biden administration has reviewed and approved the rule. Reentry into the Paris Agreement and President Biden’s executive orders may result in the development of additional regulations or changes to existing regulations. Potential future restrictions include, among other things, the United States enacting additional GHG regulations and mandated financial, emissions and other disclosures. The terms on which the United States will be re-entering the Paris Agreement are unclear at this time. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, Natural Gas’ revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or that would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate. Additionally, Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses’ revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services. For further discussion, see “Business—Environmental Matters” in Item 1 and “— Risk Factors
 Affecting Natural Gas’ Business —Natural Gas must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas delivered and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.” Furthermore, in March 2020, we established a goal to reduce carbon emissions directly attributable to our operations 70% from 2005 levels by 2035, and we announced a broad corporate initiative to achieve a net reduction of carbon emissions attributed to customer usage 20–30% from 2005 levels by 2040. Our ability to achieve these carbon emission reduction goals depends on various external factors, including supportive energy policies, alternative fuels programs, research and development efforts focused on low-carbon technologies such as carbon capture, customer participation in conservation and energy-efficiency programs and low natural gas prices. We expect to increase our renewable energy resources portfolio as part of our IRP process and to continue optimizing technology advancements to modernize our systems. Any negative opinions with respect to these goals or our environmental practices, including any inability to achieve, or a scaling back of, these goals developed by regulators, customers, investors or legislators could harm our reputation. 29Evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation and natural gas businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy’s financing arrangements. Also, certain cities in CenterPoint Energy’s Natural Gas operational footprint have adopted initiatives to prohibit the construction of new natural gas facilities that would provide service and focus on electrification. For example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas. Also, Minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. Any such initiatives and legislation could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations.The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In February 2021, certain of our jurisdictions experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event that resulted in prolonged freezing temperatures, which impacted, and may continue to impact, our businesses.In Texas, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event caused many electric generation facilities to shut-down, resulting in electricity generation shortages and high electric prices in the wholesale generation market. The electricity generation shortages necessitated ERCOT to direct TDUs, including Houston Electric, to implement controlled outages in their respective service areas. In compliance with ERCOT’s directives and emergency procedures, Houston Electric implemented controlled electricity outages across its service territory, resulting in a substantial number of its customers (on certain days over a million residents) being without power, many for extended periods of time. ERCOT has stated that the electric outages were necessary to avoid prolonged large-scale, state-wide blackouts and long-term damage to the electric system in Texas. As a result, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services were diminished or interrupted for several days. Additionally, the electricity generation shortage resulted in wholesale electricity prices increasing to their maximum allowed limit. Many REPs may face financial difficulties due to their inability to recover these high prices from their customers, and any such financial difficulties may impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. For further information on the concentration of Houston Electric’s receivables with REPs, see “— Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.”During and in the immediate aftermath of the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, there has been focus on the lack of sufficient winterization protection for power generation facilities. On February 18, 2021, the Governor of Texas requested that the Texas Legislature mandate the winterization of the Texas power system, which could include TDUs. If any such protections are required in the future, the cost of such protections may increase the cost of electricity and reduce consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers in Houston Electric’s service territory, which could adversely affect Houston Electric’s results of operations. Any potential decreases in customer usage due to higher electricity prices charged by REPs may not result in increased base rates charged by Houston Electric for its services until its next general base rate proceeding. For further information on Houston Electric’s regulatory proceedings, see “— Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs.”Furthermore, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event also impacted the wholesale prices CenterPoint Energy and CERC paid for natural gas and their ability to service customers in their Natural Gas service territories, including due to the reduction in available natural gas capacity and impacts to CenterPoint Energy’s and CERC’s natural gas supply portfolio activities, and the effects of weather on their systems and their ability to transport natural gas, among other things. CenterPoint Energy and CERC experienced significant impacts as the February 2021 Winter Storm Event impacted the overall natural gas market, including resulting in increases in the costs of natural gas supply. In particular, the February 2021 Winter Storm Event also caused severe disruptions in the markets from which CenterPoint Energy and CERC sourced a significant portion of their natural gas for their utility operations, resulting in extraordinary increases in the price of natural gas to CenterPoint Energy and CERC. From February 12, 2021 to February 22, 2021, management estimates CenterPoint Energy spent approximately an incremental $2.5 billion more on natural gas supplies compared to plan (inclusive of an incremental $2.3 billion more spent by CERC on natural gas supplies compared to plan). These amounts are preliminary estimates through February 23, 2021 and are subject to final settlement. These purchases are generally payable at the end of March 2021. As of February 22, 2021, CenterPoint Energy had approximately $2.1 billion in total liquidity. While CenterPoint Energy and CERC will seek to recover these increased gas purchase costs from customers (although neither full recovery nor the timing of that recovery is certain), in the interim, CenterPoint Energy and CERC will seek additional external financing to pay for such natural gas working capital, which may consist of short and long-term debt, but such external financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all. On February 24, 2021, CERC received financing commitments totaling $1.7 billion for a 364-day term loan facility to bridge potential working capital needs. Any additional external debt financing and/or partial or delayed recovery of these natural gas 30costs may negatively impact CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s credit metrics, and could lead to a downgrade of CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s credit rating. The inability of CenterPoint Energy or CERC to recover all or a portion of the increased costs of natural gas, or any associated delay in recovery, in addition to the increased external financing required to pay for such natural gas could have a material adverse impact on CenterPoint Energy’s or CERC’s, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In addition to the risks discussed in this risk factor, for further information on risks related to: •the arranging of future financings on acceptable terms, see “— If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited”;  •the ability to seek recovery of the additional costs natural gas, see “— Rate regulation of Natural Gas may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs”;  •access to natural gas supplies, see “— Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for Natural Gas’s customers”;•various regulatory, investigations, litigation or other proceedings, see “— In connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, there have been calls for reform of the Texas electric market, which, if implemented, could have material adverse impacts on Houston Electric”;•the fluctuations in notional natural gas prices, see “— Natural Gas is subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices, which could affect the ability of its suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition”; •the impact of a decline in CERC’s credit rating, see “— A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping arrangements or to purchase natural gas, which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition”; and•potential reforms of the Texas electric market, see “— In connection with the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, there have been calls for reform of the Texas electric market, which, if implemented, could have material adverse impacts on Houston Electric’s business.”CenterPoint Energy may be unable to effectively complete the integration of the businesses acquired in the Merger, including the integration of technology systems, for which significant time and resources have been allocated thereto. CenterPoint Energy continues to integrate certain aspects of CenterPoint Energy’s and Vectren’s businesses. The integration of technology systems and processes that CenterPoint Energy uses to plan and report financial information, manage work, monitor systems, respond to outages and perform other critical functions has been, and continues to be, a complex, costly and time consuming process, which is expected to be completed in 2021. CenterPoint Energy may experience delays, cost-overruns or other issues affecting the successful completion of the integration of these technology systems and other related processes. The failure to timely, efficiently and cost-effectively complete the integration could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations and cash flows. In connection with the integration of such technology systems and processes, CenterPoint Energy must also successfully design and operate its systems of internal controls to continue to accurately provide reliable financial reports, including reporting of its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If CenterPoint Energy’s efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls throughout the integration of its technology systems are not successful, it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial reporting and processes in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, CenterPoint Energy could be harmed or it may fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in CenterPoint Energy’s reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on, among other things, the trading prices of its securities.Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks inherent in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and in the delivery of natural gas that could result in substantial losses or other damages. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols;•the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;31•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •information technology or financial and billing system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, ice storms, flooding, terrorism, wildfires, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, including any environmental impacts related thereto, which catastrophic events may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Our revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Similarly, Indiana Electric’s revenues are derived from rates it charges its customers to provide electricity. Natural Gas’ revenues are primarily derived from natural gas sales. Consequently, Houston Electric’s, Indiana Electric’s and Natural Gas’ revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity and natural gas usage, as applicable. Houston Electric’s revenues are generally higher during the warmer months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electric’s results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as in certain past years, extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. A significant portion of Indiana Electric’s sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, as in certain past years, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather, while more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. Natural Gas’ revenues are customarily higher during the winter months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish Natural Gas’ results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as occurred in certain past years, extreme cold weather conditions could increase its results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring. For information related to our weather hedges, see Note 9(a) to the consolidated financial statements. For additional risks related to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see “—The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” below and Note 22 to the consolidated condensed financial statements for further information.Climate changes could adversely impact financial results from our businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events that could adversely affect our results of operations.A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories. If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, Natural Gas could be adversely affected through lower natural gas usage. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes or severe winter weather conditions, including ice storms. Since certain of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers. For example, in 2020, eight named storms occurred along the Gulf Coast. Of these eight storms, we experienced four named hurricanes in our service territories, which impacted our Natural Gas facilities. Our electric and Natural Gas operations in our services territories were impacted due to the February 2021 Winter Storm Event. For further information on the February 2021 Winter Storm Event, see Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements and “—The February 2021 Winter Storm Event has caused severe disruptions to our customers and our markets in certain of our jurisdictions and could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” above. When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Any such decreased energy use may also require us to retire current infrastructure that is no longer needed. Further, we may be subject to climate change lawsuits, which could result in substantial penalties or damages. 32Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets, including the failure of equipment or processes and potential breakdowns due to such aging. The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs because of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely and full recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. In addition, the nature of information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Further, with respect to Natural Gas’ operations, if certain pipeline replacements (for example, cast-iron or bare steel pipe) are not completed timely or successfully, government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires, explosions or leaks. Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event that a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change. We operate businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant investments and expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar, microturbines, fuel cells), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce energy consumption and waste. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, including Indiana Electric’s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner, to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected, adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend, in part, on our management’s ability to implement our business strategies successfully and realize the anticipated benefits therefrom. In May 2020, our Board of Directors established a Business Review and Evaluation Committee, which was designed to assist the Board of Directors in evaluating and optimizing our businesses, assets and ownership interests. In October 2020, the Business Review and Evaluation Committee of the Board of Directors completed its review and made final recommendations to the full Board of Directors. Our business strategy incorporated the Business Review and Evaluation Committee’s recommendations to further increase our planned capital expenditures in our electric and Natural Gas businesses to support rate base growth and sell certain of our Natural Gas businesses located in Arkansas and Oklahoma as a means to efficiently finance a portion of such increased capital expenditures, among other recommendations. From time to time we have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, including our proposed sale of our Natural Gas businesses in Arkansas and Oklahoma and the Enable Merger, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings. However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. In particular, if proceeds from our proposed sale are less than what we anticipate or if those sales or the Enable Merger are not completed for any reason, we may be required to seek alternative methods to finance our proposed capital expenditure program or cut back on such capital expenditure program. 33For additional risks related to the Enable Merger, see the risks listed under the “Risk Factors
 Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP” and Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the Enable Merger. If we are unable to make acquisitions, or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our future growth may be adversely affected. Further, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.    We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors such as unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories and changes in customers’ perceptions from incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate and market conditions in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives, use of alternative technologies and changes in our customers’ perceptions regarding natural gas usage as a result of incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, including population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. Declines in demand for electricity and natural gas in our service territories due to pipeline incidents of other utilities, increased electricity and natural gas prices as experienced during the February 2021 Winter Storm Event and economic downturns, among other factors, could reduce overall usage and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and natural gas. Although Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity delivered and used as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, the significant decline in energy and commodity prices that occurred during 2020, if sustained into 2021, could cause the rate of economic, employment and/or population growth in certain of our service territories to decline. In particular, Houston, Texas has a higher percentage of employment tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. A reduction in the rate of economic, employment and/or population growth could result in lower growth and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in such service territories. As such, sustained low energy and commodity prices could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP (CenterPoint Energy)CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects, whether as a result of Enable’s performance or otherwise, or if it reduces its ownership in Enable.CenterPoint Energy holds a substantial limited partner interest in Enable (53.7% of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Enable as of December 31, 2020), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable GP and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP. As of December 31, 2020, CenterPoint Energy owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Enable Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable. Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy’s future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions it receives from Enable and the value of its interests in Enable. Enable has historically been expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash 34reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to Enable GP and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”). Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it (i) to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units or (ii) maintain or increase the distributions on its common units. On April 1, 2020, in response to COVID-19 and economic conditions impacting the oil and gas industry, Enable announced a reduction in its quarterly distributions per common unit from $0.3305 distributed for the fourth quarter 2019 to $0.16525, representing a 50% reduction. This reduction has resulted in, and is expected to result in additional, quarterly distributions to CenterPoint Energy that fall below the expected minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per common unit. This reduction in Enable’s quarterly distributions per common unit reduces its common unit distributions to CenterPoint Energy by approximately $155 million per year assuming no further reductions. To the extent such economic conditions persist or further deteriorate, quarterly distributions on Enable’s common units may be subject to further reductions. For further discussion regarding CenterPoint Energy’s impairment of its equity investment in Enable, please see “—An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment to CenterPoint Energy’s Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment could reduce our earnings.”Enable is expected to pay a distribution of $0.625 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.50 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis, until February 17, 2021. Thereafter, Enable is expected to pay a distribution on the Enable Series A Preferred Units with an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 8.5%. Distributions on each Enable Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are non-cumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Enable Series A Preferred Units. Additionally, distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common units. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things, the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles and the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil. Please refer to Enable’s operational, regulatory and financial risks and other factors set forth in its SEC filings that may have a material impact on its performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable.Additionally, CenterPoint Energy’s process of evaluating and optimizing the various businesses, assets and ownership interests currently held by it considered, among other things, various plans, proposals and other strategic alternatives with respect to Enable and CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable. In February 2021, CenterPoint Energy announced its support of the Enable Merger, which is expected to close in the second half of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, including Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance. See Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. CenterPoint Energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from the Enable Merger, if completed, or from any disposition or reduction of its resulting investment in Energy Transfer. There can be no assurances that any disposal of Energy Transfer common units or Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units will be completed. Any disposal of such securities may involve significant costs and expenses, including in connection with any public offering, a significant underwriting discount. There can be no assurances that CenterPoint Energy will be able to reinvest any proceeds from the disposition of any Energy Transfer common units or Energy Transfer Series G Preferred Units, if any, when received as a result of the closing of the Enable Merger, in a manner that provides for a similar rate of return as those securities.We cannot be certain of the precise value of any merger consideration we may receive in the Enable Merger because the exchange ratio is fixed and the market price of Energy Transfer’s common units may fluctuate. At the time the Enable Merger is completed, each issued and outstanding Enable common unit we own will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of 0.8595 of one common unit representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer. The exchange ratio for the merger consideration is fixed, and there will be no adjustment to the merger consideration for changes in the market price of Energy Transfer’s common units or Enable’s common units prior to the completion of the Enable Merger. If the Enable Merger is completed, there will be a time lapse between the Enable Merger Agreement date and the date on which we are entitled to, and actually receive, the merger consideration. The market value of Energy Transfer’s common units may fluctuate during this period as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Energy Transfer’s businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Such factors are difficult to predict and, in many cases, may be beyond Enable’s and Energy Transfer’s control. The actual value of any merger consideration we receive upon the completion of the Enable Merger will depend on the market value of the Energy Transfer common units at that time. This market value may differ, possibly materially, from the market value of Energy Transfer’s common units at the time the merger agreement was entered into or at any other time.35The Enable Merger may not be completed, and the Enable Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.The Enable Merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to its completion, including (i) the receipt of the required approvals from Enable’s unitholders, (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (iii) the absence of any governmental order or law that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the Enable Merger, (iv) Energy Transfer common units issuable in connection with the Enable Merger having been authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance and (v) Energy Transfer’s registration statement on Form S-4 having been declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act. The obligation of each party to consummate the Enable Merger is also conditioned upon the other party’s representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Enable Merger Agreement. Enable’s obligation to consummate the Enable Merger is further conditioned upon the receipt of a customary tax opinion of counsel that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to certain exceptions, (i) it should not recognize any income or gain as a result of the Enable Merger and (ii) no gain or loss should be recognized by holders of Enable’s common units or Series A Preferred Units as a result of the Enable Merger. These conditions to the completion of the Enable Merger may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Enable Merger may be delayed or may not be completed.Moreover, if the Enable Merger is not completed by November 30, 2021, either Energy Transfer or Enable may choose not to proceed with the Enable Merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Enable Merger agreement at any time, before or after approval by Enable’s common unitholders. In addition, Energy Transfer and Enable may elect to terminate the Enable Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances as further detailed in the Enable Merger Agreement. If the Enable Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Enable may be required to pay Energy Transfer a termination fee. Furthermore, if the Enable Merger is not completed for any reason, Enable’s future businesses and financial results may be adversely affected, including, among other things, Enable may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of its common units.Enable will be subject to business uncertainties while the Enable Merger is pending, which could adversely affect its businesses.Uncertainties about the effect of the Enable Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Enable. These uncertainties may impair its ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter and could cause customers and others that deal with Enable to seek to change their existing business relationships. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Enable Merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with Energy Transfer following the Enable Merger. In addition, the Enable Merger Agreement restricts Enable from entering into certain corporate transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of Energy Transfer, and generally requires Enable’s to continue its operations in the ordinary course, until completion of the Enable Merger. These restrictions may prevent Enable from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Enable Merger.The common units representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer to be received by us upon completion of the Enable Merger will have different rights than Enable’s common units.Upon completion of the Enable Merger, we will no longer be unitholders of Enable. Instead, we will become Energy Transfer unitholders and, while our rights as Energy Transfer unitholders will continue to be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware, such rights will be subject to and governed by the terms of the Energy Transfer Certificate of Limited Partnership, as amended, and the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Energy Transfer, as amended. The laws of the state of Delaware and terms of the Energy Transfer certificate of limited partnership and the Energy Transfer Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership are in some respects different than the terms of Enable’s Certificate of Limited Partnership and its Partnership Agreement, which currently govern our rights.General Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses and/or CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPCyberattacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.We are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our businesses, which includes, among other things, (i) managing operations and other business processes and (ii) protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal 36course of business. For example, the operation of our electric generation, transmission and distribution systems are dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our systems and third-party systems. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of the intelligent grid, smart devices and operational technologies across our businesses. Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyberattack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems. Similarly, our business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enable’s pipeline facilities and third-party systems. The gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enable’s facilities. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events, such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets.Cyberattacks, including phishing attacks and threats from the use of malicious code such as malware, ransomware and viruses, and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us to possible legal claims and liability. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyberattacks and unauthorized access. We are not fully insured against all cybersecurity risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. As domestic and global cyber threats are on-going and increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, our critical energy infrastructure may be targets of state-sponsored attacks, terrorist activities or otherwise that could disrupt our respective business operations. Furthermore, experts have observed an increase in the volume and the sophistication of cyberattacks since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could lead to additional disruptions. For information about our cybersecurity risks related to COVID-19, please see “—We face risks related to COVID-19 and other health epidemics and outbreaks, including economic, regulatory, legal, workforce and cyber security risks, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity” below. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities, restore service and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.In connection with our businesses, we and our vendors, suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information (for example, information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy is increasingly demanding. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions and other legal requirements could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have insurance in place, such as general liability and property insurance, to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to fully cover or restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Costs, damages and other liabilities related to recent events and incidents that affected other utilities, such as wildfires and explosions, among other things, have exceeded or could exceed such utilities’ insurance coverage. Further, as a result of these recent events and incidents, the marketplace for insurance coverage may be unavailable or limited in capacity or any such available coverage may be deemed by us to be cost prohibitive under current conditions. Any such coverage, if available, may not be eligible for recovery, whether in full or in part, by us through the rates charged by our utility businesses.37In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and insurance capacity to be limited. Historically, Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise.  In the future, any such recovery may not be granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We face risks related to COVID-19 and other health epidemics and outbreaks, including economic, regulatory, legal, workforce and cyber security risks, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly evolving situation that is adversely affecting current global economic activities and conditions. An extended slowdown of economic growth, decreased demand for commodities and/or material changes in governmental or regulatory policy in the United States has resulted in, and could continue to result in, lower growth, including customer growth, and reduced demand for and usage of electricity and natural gas in our service territories as customer facilities close, remain closed or potentially close again. We have experienced reduced demand and usage among our electric and natural gas commercial and industrial customers, as well as a decrease in revenues from disconnections and reconnections due to the disconnect moratoriums across our service territories due to COVID-19, which have either expired or may expire during the second quarter of 2021 in certain of the Registrants’ service territories. The ability of our customers, contractors and suppliers to meet their obligations to us, including payment obligations, has also been negatively affected under the current economic conditions. As a result of the disconnect moratoriums across our Natural Gas service territories and other payment deferrals or arrangements, days outstanding on receivables and uncollectible accounts have increased, resulting in an increase to allowance for credit losses. To the extent these conditions in our service territories persist, our bad debt expense from uncollectible accounts could continue to increase, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. REPs could encounter financial difficulties, including bankruptcies, which could impair their ability to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments, adversely affecting Houston Electric’s cash flows and liquidity. Additionally, our state and local regulatory agencies, in response to a federal mandate or otherwise, could impose restrictions on the rates we charge to provide our services, including the inability to implement approved rates, or delay actions with respect to our rate cases and filings. The COVID-19 pandemic may affect our ability to timely satisfy regulatory requirements such as recordkeeping and/or timely reporting requirements. For further information on COVID-19 regulatory matters, please see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. With respect to our supply chain, while we have not experienced significant disruptions or challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, to the extent we experience such disruptions in our supply chain that limit our ability to obtain materials and equipment necessary for our businesses, whether through delayed order fulfillment, limited production or unavailability due to COVID-19, we may be unable to perform our operations timely or as anticipated, which could result in service or construction delays or increased costs. Furthermore, in the event key officers or a substantial portion of our workforce were to be impacted by COVID-19 for an extended period of time, we may face challenges with respect to our services or operations and we may not be able to execute our capital plan as anticipated. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread, even with the availability of a vaccine therefor, and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of COVID-19, such as large-scale travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns. Restrictions of this nature have caused, and may continue to cause, us, our suppliers and other business counterparties to experience operational delays, shortages of employees, facility shutdowns or business closures. We have modified certain business and workforce practices (including those related to employee travel, employee work locations and participation in meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. However, the quarantine of personnel or the inability to access our facilities or customer sites could adversely affect our operations. While certain of our personnel have been, and may continue to be, quarantined, our operations and corporate functions have not been adversely affected to date. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we have increased the permitted occupancy of certain of our offices and facilities, with the rest of our office-based personnel continuing to work remotely under alternate work arrangements. Where we must maintain a presence in the field, we have adjusted our operational protocols to minimize exposure and risk to our field personnel, customers and the communities we serve, including, among other things, modifying our work schedules and reporting locations, delaying certain work types, such as maintenance and capital projects, and adjusting project scope and scale to adhere to safety protocols, while continuing to maintain the work activities necessary for safe and reliable service to our customers with increased safety precautions, but we cannot assure that such adjustments and precautions will be sufficient to minimize exposure to and risk from COVID-19. Also, we have a limited number of highly skilled employees for some of our operations. If a large proportion of our employees in those critical positions were to contract COVID-19 at the same time, we would rely upon our business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations at our facilities, but there is no certainty that 38such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the adverse impact to our operations that could result from shortages of highly skilled employees. Additionally, in the event that customers, contractors, employees or others were to allege that they contracted COVID-19 because of actions we took or failed to take, we could face claims, lawsuits and potential legal liability. In addition to the reasonableness of our actions and efforts to comply with applicable COVID-19 guidance, our exposure and ultimate liability would depend upon the applicability of workers’ compensation, the availability of insurance coverage and limitations on liability being considered or enacted at the state and federal level.Experts have observed an increase in the volume and the sophistication of cyberattacks since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any technology system breaches and/or data privacy incidents could disrupt our operations or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer, employee or company information and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As many of our employees and third-party service providers work remotely in accordance with government mandates or guidelines, we face heightened cyber security and privacy risks related to unauthorized system access, aggressive social engineering tactics and adversaries attacking the information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct our business. The increase in the remote working arrangements of our employees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has required enhancements and modifications to our information technology infrastructure (for example, virtual private network, or VPN, and remote collaboration systems), and any failures of these technologies, including third-party service providers, that facilitate working remotely could limit our ability to conduct our ordinary operations and expose us to increased risk or impact of a cyberattack. We will continue to monitor developments affecting our employees, customers and operations. At this time, however, we cannot predict the extent or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or its effects on national, state and local economies, including the impact on our ability to access capital markets, our supply chain, our business strategies and plans and our workforce, nor can we estimate the potential adverse impact from COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain good labor relations could adversely impact the operations of our facilities and our results of operations.Our businesses are dependent on recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our businesses, particularly the specialized skills and knowledge required to construct and operate generation facilities, a technology-enabled power grid and transmission and distribution facilities, among other facilities. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.Furthermore, the operations of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees, and several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions, comprising approximately 36% of our workforce. We have several separate bargaining units, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described further in Note 8(j) to the consolidated financial statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference. The collective bargaining agreements with OPEIU Local 12 and Mankato related to Natural Gas employees in Minnesota are scheduled to expire in May 2021 and March 2021, respectively, and negotiations are currently in progress and expected to be completed before the May 2021 and March 2021 expirations. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.39Changing demographics, poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees. Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, contributions to the plan, the number of plan participants and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations, or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements, these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.We may be significantly affected by changes in federal income tax laws and regulations, including any comprehensive federal tax reform legislation.Our businesses are impacted by U.S. federal income tax policy. Under the Biden administration with the Senate and House of Representatives controlled by the Democratic Party, comprehensive federal tax reform legislation could be enacted that may significantly change the federal income tax laws applicable to domestic businesses, including changes that may increase the federal income tax rate and impact investment incentives and deductions for depreciation and interest, among other deductions. While CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries cannot assess the overall impact of any such potential legislation on our businesses, it is possible that our results of operations, financial conditions or cash flows could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, with any enacted federal tax reform legislation, it is uncertain how state commissions and local municipalities may require us to respond to the effects of such tax legislation, including determining the treatment of EDIT and other increases and decreases in our revenue requirements. As such, potential regulatory actions in response to any enacted tax legislation could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 16 to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Additionally, under some circumstances, the Registrants could potentially have claims filed against them or incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them as a result of sales, divestitures or other transfers to third parties who may be unable to fulfill their indemnity obligations to the Registrants. Final resolution of these matters, or any potential future claims or liabilities, may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial results.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows"
9,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2020-02-27,"Risk Factors
 CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric, CERC, SIGECO, Indiana Gas and VEDO. CenterPoint Energy also owns interests in Enable. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10-K, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company, the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries and its interests in Enable. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s businesses. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this combined report on Form 10-K, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Certain Factors Affecting Future Earnings” in Item 7, which should be read in conjunction with the risk factors contained in this Item 1A. Carefully consider each of the risks described below, including those relating to Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy, are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined report on Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its subsidiaries. Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionCenterPoint Energy is a holding company with no operations or operating assets of its own. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and from Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions. CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from, and holds all of its assets through, its subsidiaries, including its interests in Enable. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on distributions from its subsidiaries and Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. In general, CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ and Enable’s ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy, and its subsidiaries or Enable could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make payments or other distributions. For a description of these restrictions and further information on ring-fencing measures that may adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s ability to receive dividends from Houston Electric as well as other financial impacts, please read “—The imposition of certain 23ring-fencing measures at Houston Electric could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations.”  Additionally, CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations, future growth and earnings and dividend goals depend on the performance of its utility and non-utility (such as CES, Infrastructure Services and ESG) subsidiaries which contribute to a portion of its consolidated earnings and which may not perform at expected or forecasted levels or do not achieve the projected growth in these businesses as anticipated. As part of their non-utility businesses, CenterPoint Energy and CERC also offer home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Texas and Louisiana (through a third-party provider) and provide home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in Minnesota. For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives with respect to its interests in Enable, please read “— Additional Risk Factors
 Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects.” CenterPoint Energy’s right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by CenterPoint Energy.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive, and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures. For example, we depend on (i) long-term debt, (ii) borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and, for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, commercial paper programs, (iii) distributions from CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable and (iv) if market conditions permit, issuances of additional shares of common and/or preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy.  We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy had $15.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $977 million of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. For information on maturities through 2024, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enable’s units or volatility in Enable’s unit price;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•the future performance of our and Enable’s businesses;•integration of Vectren’s businesses into CenterPoint Energy;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2019, Houston Electric had approximately $4.0 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including approximately $68 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, Houston Electric had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, up to 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $3.7 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2019. However, Houston Electric 24has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. As of December 31, 2019, SIGECO had approximately $293 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding. SIGECO may issue additional bonds under its Mortgage Indenture up to 60% of currently unfunded property additions. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $1.1 billion of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued on this basis. However, under certain circumstances Indiana Electric is limited in its ability to issue additional bonds under the Mortgage Indenture due to a provision in its parent’s, VUHI, indentures.The Registrants’ current credit ratings and any changes in credit ratings in 2019 and to date in 2020 are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. The Registrants note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold their securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms. The imposition of certain ring-fencing measures at Houston Electric could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations. As part of its most recent base rate proceeding, Houston Electric has agreed, as part of a settlement, to certain “ring-fencing” measures to increase its financial separateness from CenterPoint Energy. As part of the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric and CenterPoint Energy are subject to various ring-fencing measures. For further information about the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. Additionally, further ring-fencing measures could be imposed on Houston Electric in the future through legislation or PUCT rules or orders. As a result of such ring-fencing measures, CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows, credit quality, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect the cost of capital related to outstanding debt and other financial instruments.The LIBOR is the basic rate of interest widely used as a global reference for setting interest rates on variable rate loans and other securities. Each of the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities, including certain facilities or financial instruments entered into by their subsidiaries, use LIBOR as a reference rate. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021.  It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. If LIBOR reference rates become unavailable, any LIBOR borrowings under the Registrants’ credit and term loan facilities would convert at the end of the applicable interest period to alternate base rate loans and any future borrowings thereunder would be made as alternate base rate loans. Alternate base rate loans generally constitute a higher cost of capital. Certain of CenterPoint Energy’s credit and term loan facilities provide for a mechanism to amend such facility to reflect the establishment of an alternative reference rate upon the inability to determine the LIBOR-based Eurodollar rate or occurrence of certain events related to the phase-out of LIBOR. However, we have not yet pursued any technical amendment or other contractual alternative to address this matter and are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement or unavailability of the LIBOR interest rate. In addition, the overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential phase-out and alternative reference rates or disruption in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment to CenterPoint Energy’s Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment could reduce our earnings.Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require CenterPoint Energy to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy has increased the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based on future adverse changes to the acquired businesses or general market conditions. 25In connection with its preparation of financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy and CERC, as applicable, identified triggering events for interim goodwill impairment tests at their Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units. Early stage bids received from market participants during the exploration of strategic alternatives for these businesses at year-end indicated that the carrying value of each reporting unit was more likely than not below the fair value. As a result, CenterPoint Energy and CERC evaluated long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, and specifically identifiable intangibles subject to amortization, for recoverability and the goodwill within the reporting units was tested for impairment as of December 31, 2019.  The long-lived assets within the Infrastructure Services and Energy Services reporting units were determined to be recoverable based on undiscounted cash flows, considering the likelihood of possible outcomes existing as of December 31, 2019, including the assessment of the likelihood of a future sale of these assets. CenterPoint Energy and CERC recognized an impairment loss of $48 million, the amount by which the carrying value (inclusive of deferred income tax liabilities of $25 million) of their respective Energy Services reporting unit exceeded fair value as of December 31, 2019. Following the impairment, the carrying value of the goodwill remaining in the Energy Services reporting unit is $62 million as of December 31, 2019.  CenterPoint Energy did not recognize any impairments on its Infrastructure Services reporting unit in 2019.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reporting unit.  As a result, certain assets and liabilities representing a business within this reporting unit that will be transferred under the Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Disposal Group”) met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2020.  Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the Disposal Group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities. CenterPoint Energy anticipates recording an impairment loss on assets held for sale of approximately $85 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2020. The actual amount of the impairment or loss may be materially different from the preliminary amount.Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reporting unit. Certain assets and liabilities representing a business within this reporting unit that will be transferred under the Equity Purchase Agreement (the “Disposal Group”) met the held for sale criteria during the first quarter of 2020.  Because the transaction is structured as an asset sale for income tax purposes, the Disposal Group will exclude the deferred tax liabilities and certain assets and liabilities within the reporting unit that will be retained by CenterPoint Energy and CERC upon closing.  CenterPoint Energy and CERC anticipate recording an impairment loss, consisting of both goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, on assets held for sale of approximately $80 million, plus an additional loss for transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2020.  The actual amount of the impairment or loss may be materially different from the preliminary amount. For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, if Enable’s common unit price, distributions or earnings were to decline, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, CenterPoint Energy could determine that it is unable to recover the carrying value of its equity investment in Enable. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. Such an impairment occurred during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to the sustained low Enable common unit price and further declines in such price that year, among other factors impacting the midstream oil and gas industry. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy’s total investment in Enable is $10.29 per unit and Enable’s common unit price closed at $10.03 per unit (approximately $61 million below carrying value). Based on an analysis of its investment in Enable as of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy believes that the decline in the value of its investment is temporary, and that the carrying value of its investment of $2.4 billion will be recovered. On February 24, 2020, Enable’s common unit price closed at $7.63 (approximately $622 million below carrying value). A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in CenterPoint Energy again recording impairment charges in the future. For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for as investments without a readily determinable fair value, such as the Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment, the carrying value of the asset may be adjusted to fair value, resulting in a gain or loss in the period, if a transaction on an identical or similar investment in Enable is observed.  Additionally, CenterPoint Energy considers qualitative impairment triggers, such as significant deterioration in earnings performance, significant decline in market condition and other factors that raise significant concerns about Enable’s ability to continue as a going concern, to determine if an impairment analysis should be performed on its investment. Should the annual impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction, as described above, indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A non-cash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.26Changing demographics, poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees. Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, contributions to the plan, the number of plan participants and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations, or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.CenterPoint Energy, through Infrastructure Services, also contributes to several multi-employer pension plans. If Infrastructure Services withdraws from these plans, CenterPoint Energy may be required to pay an amount based on the allocable share of the plans’ unfunded vested benefits, referred to as the withdrawal liability. This could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees may increase substantially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We provide health care benefits to eligible employees and retirees through self-insured and insured plans. In recent years, the costs of providing these benefits per beneficiary increased due to higher health care costs and higher levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims. We anticipate that such costs will continue to rise. Further, the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our health care benefit programs and costs. Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts, which are likely to be passed on to us, cannot be determined with certainty at this time. Our costs of providing these benefits could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by the Registrants or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact the Registrants’ results of operations and those of Enable.The Registrants use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risks. The Registrants or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. Additionally, in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact its cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. CenterPoint Energy has approximately $828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31, 2019. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($75 million in the aggregate, or $5.28 per ZENS, as of December 31, 2019) or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  CenterPoint Energy’s ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31, 2019, deferred taxes of approximately $429 million would have been payable in 2019, based on 2019 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2019 to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $149 million would have been payable in 2019. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. This could happen if CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns 27or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities shares would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged and ZENS-Related Securities shares are sold.Dividend requirements associated with the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock that CenterPoint Energy issued to fund a portion of the Merger subject it to certain risks.CenterPoint Energy has issued 800,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 19,550,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of CenterPoint Energy’s Series B Preferred Stock. Any future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays, on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock will depend on, among other things, its financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and Enable to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy, as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock when due would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, Common Stock and CenterPoint Energy’s debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy, under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock.The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock further provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such shares, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energy’s capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock or its Series B Preferred Stock (as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs) upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.Risk Factors
 Affecting Electric Generation, Transmission and Distribution Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs.Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT and Indiana Electric’s rates are regulated by the IURC. Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) based on an analysis of their invested capital, their expenses and other factors in a designated test year. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s control. For Houston Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required 48 months from the date of the order setting rates in its most recent comprehensive rate proceeding, unless the PUCT issues an order extending the deadline to file that general base rate proceeding. For Indiana Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required prior to the expiration of its TDSIC plan, which expires on December 31, 2023. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that their respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to their rates, in full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings have caused in certain instances, and in the future could cause, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to recover their investments below their requested levels, below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in their respective jurisdictions.  For instance, on April 5, 2019, Houston Electric filed its base rate application with the PUCT and the cities in its service area to change its rates, seeking approval for revenue increases of approximately $194 million, excluding a rider to refund approximately $40 million annually over three years. This rate filing was based on a rate base of $6.4 billion, a 50% debt/50% equity capital structure and a 10.4% ROE. Houston Electric also requested a prudency determination on all capital investments made since January 1, 2010; the establishment of a rider to refund approximately $119 million to its customers over three years resulting from the TCJA; updated depreciation rates; and approval to clarify and update various non-rate tariff provisions. After a five-day hearing in June 2019, and following the issuance of a PFD by the administrative law judges who heard the case, the parties entered into a Stipulation and Settlement Agreement. On February 14, 2020, the PUCT approved the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, which established rates based on a $13 million increase in annual revenues, a capital structure of 42.5% equity/57.5% debt and a 9.4% ROE. The Stipulation and Settlement Agreement requires Houston Electric to file another case within 48 months of the final order and removes the possibility that the deadline would be extended. For more information on Houston Electric’s base rate case, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. 28The rates that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time, a situation referred to as “regulatory lag.” For Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag. These adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For Houston Electric, the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utility’s rates for increases in net distribution-invested capital (e.g., distribution plant and distribution-related intangible plant and communication equipment) since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding, but Houston Electric may only make a DCRF filing once per calendar year and not during a comprehensive base rate proceeding.  In connection with the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, Houston Electric agreed not to file its DCRF in 2020. The TCOS mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital, but is only available to Houston Electric twice per calendar year. However, neither of these mechanisms provides for recovery of operations and maintenance expenses.  Similarly, for Indiana Electric, the TDSIC rate mechanism allows electric utilities (that have an IURC-approved seven-year infrastructure improvement plan) to request incremental rate increases every six months to pay for the projects included in that plan, subject to IURC approval. However, the TDSIC allows the utility to recover 80% of the costs as they are incurred, with the remaining costs to be deferred as regulatory assets to be recovered in the next base rate case. TDSIC rate increases are limited to no more than 2% of the utility’s total retail revenues from the prior year. Indiana Electric recovers transmission costs through a FERC-approved formula rate and reflects charges and costs associated with participation in MISO through the MCRA mechanism, which is filed annually. Other non-fuel purchased power costs are recovered annually via the RCRA Mechanism. Electricity suppliers are required to submit energy efficiency plans to the IURC at least once every three years. Indiana Electric recovers program and administrative costs of these plans, including lost revenues and financial incentives, via its annual DSMA mechanism. The DSMA is subject to IURC approval. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery. Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s costs or enable them to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to recover their costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Houston Electric or Indiana Electric and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Unlike Houston Electric, Indiana Electric must seek approval by the IURC for long-term financing authority and by the FERC for its short-term financing authority. This authority allows Indiana Electric the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or the FERC do not approve Indiana Electric’s financing authority, Indiana Electric may not be able to fully execute its financing plans and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.  Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services.Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Similarly, Indiana Electric’s revenues are derived from rates it charges its customers to provide electricity. Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage. Houston Electric’s revenues are generally higher during the warmer months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electric’s results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, as in certain past years, extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.29A significant portion of Indiana Electric’s sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, as in certain past years, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather, while more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.Indiana Electric’s execution of its IRP and its regulated power supply operations are subject to various risks, including timely recovery of capital investments, increased costs and facility outages or shutdowns. Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP every three years, unless extended, to the IURC that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period on a periodic basis. Indiana Electric’s 2016 IRP modeling projects that the lowest cost and least risk generation portfolio to serve customers over the next 20 years involves retirement of a significant portion of its current generating fleet and replacing that generation capacity with other resources. Implementation of Indiana Electric’s IRP will likely require recovery of new capital investments, as well as costs of retiring the current generation fleet, including any remaining unrecovered costs of retired assets.  In February 2018, as part of its electric generation transition plan, Indiana Electric filed a petition seeking authorization from the IURC to construct a new 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility to replace certain existing generation capacity at an approximate cost of $900 million, which included the cost of a new natural gas pipeline to serve the facility, among other things. While the IURC approved the construction of a 50 MW universal solar array and the plan to retrofit its largest, most efficient coal-fired generation unit (Culley Unit 3), the IURC denied Indiana Electric’s request to construct a 700-850 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility. The IURC urged Indiana Electric to utilize its next IRP planning cycle to evaluate the merits of a more diverse generation portfolio.During the 2019 Indiana legislative session, certain proposed legislation would have prohibited the construction of new generation assets 250 MW or larger until 2021, among other prohibitions, by directing the IURC to not issue any final orders in proceedings requesting such construction. Although this proposed legislation was ultimately defeated, a similar moratorium on the construction of new generation assets in Indiana could be reintroduced in a subsequent legislative session. Legislation has been proposed in 2020 that would require IURC approval to retire coal-fired generation. This legislation, by its terms, would sunset in early 2021 and is not expected to impact Indiana Electric as currently drafted.With respect to its upcoming IRP, Indiana Electric has conducted a request for proposals targeting 10 to 700 MW of capacity and unit-contingent energy and anticipates filing its 2019/2020 IRP in mid-2020. While the IURC does not approve or reject the IRP, the process involves the issuance of a staff report that provides comments on the IRP.  Depending on comments received on the IRP, the filing of any future requests for generating facilities could be delayed. Further, certain legislative activities such as the proposed moratorium in 2019 or other legislation restricting or delaying new generation could negatively affect Indiana Electric’s ability to construct new generation facilities and execution of its capital plan. Even if a generation project is approved, risks associated with the construction of any new generation exist, including the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, scarcity of resources and labor, ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation, the effects of potential construction delays and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements. Further, there is no guarantee that the IURC will approve the requests included in any of Indiana Electric’s future filed petitions relating to its IRP.Additionally, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased purchase power costs and inadvertent releases of coal ash and/or other contaminants with a significant environmental impact. These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns or malfunctions due to equipment failure or operator error; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; or natural disasters, all of which could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s business. Further, Indiana Electric relies on coal for substantially all of its generation capacity. Currently, its coal supply is purchased largely from a single, unrelated party and, although the coal supply is under long-term contract, the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, as a member of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, could be subject to higher costs for system improvements, as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions. As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems. In addition, the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO, respectively. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, 30under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a Delaware non-profit corporation. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures, which may not be fully recoverable in rates. In addition, if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2019, Houston Electric did business with approximately 68 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., formerly known as TCEH Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2019 was $192 million. Approximately 32% and 12% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP.  Risk Factors
 Affecting Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Energy Services Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)On February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.Rate regulation of NGD may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs.NGD’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions based on an analysis of NGD’s invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic) in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment. Each of these proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of NGD’s control. NGD has pending, or anticipates the filing of, rate cases in Indiana, Minnesota and Texas during 2020. NGD can make no assurance that these respective base rate proceedings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates, full cost recovery or approval of other requested items, including, among other things, capital structure and ROE. Moreover, these base rate proceedings could cause NGD to recover its investments at rates below its requested level, below the national average for utilities or below recently approved levels for other utilities in those jurisdictions.The rates that NGD is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.” Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval, which we cannot assure would be approved, and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce or otherwise impede NGD’s ability to adjust its rates or result in rates below those requested by NGD.Arkansas allows public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP, providing for a utility’s base rates to be adjusted once a year. In each of Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions. Additionally, in Minnesota, the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling program, which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers. Further, in Indiana, NGD may file a CSIA every six months to seek rate increases to recover certain federally mandated project costs (e.g., pipeline safety). The TDSIC (recovered 31through the CSIA), allows the utility to recover 80% of its project costs associated with an IURC-approved seven-year infrastructure improvement plan as they are incurred, with the remaining costs to be deferred until the next base rate case, and rate increases are limited to no more than 2% of the utility’s total retail revenues. In Ohio, the DRR is an annual mechanism that allows a utility to recover its investments in utility plant and operating expenses associated with replacing bare steel and cast-iron pipelines, as well as certain other infrastructure investments. The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body. In Texas, NGD’s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year until a general rate case is filed. NGD must file a general rate case no later than five and a half years after the initial GRIP implementation date.NGD can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of NGD’s costs or enable NGD to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact NGD’s ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGD’s cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Unlike CERC, Indiana Gas, SIGECO’s natural gas distribution business and VEDO must seek approval by the IURC and PUCO, as applicable, for long-term financing authority. This authority allows these utilities the flexibility to enter into various financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or PUCO do not approve these utilities’ respective financing authorities, they may not be able to fully execute their financing plans and their respective financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.  Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for NGD’s customers.NGD depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. Substantially all of NGD’s natural gas supply is purchased from intrastate and interstate pipelines. If NGD is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet NGD’s requirements, the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in NGD’s service territories could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, acts of terrorism or cyber-attacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, could also adversely affect NGD’s businesses. Further, to the extent that NGD’s natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then NGD’s operations could be negatively affected.NGD and CES are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of their suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect their liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. NGD and CES are subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials that impact their businesses, including transportation and storage, whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements. Increases in natural gas prices might affect NGD’s and CES’s ability to collect balances due from their customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which NGD and CES operate, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that NGD’s and CES’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral required under hedging arrangements. AMAs may be subject to regulatory approval, and such agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed with less favorable terms.32A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas, which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.NGD’s and CES’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.NGD’s and CES’s revenues are primarily derived from natural gas sales. Thus, their revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months. As in certain past years, unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. Conversely, as occurred in certain past years, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The states in which NGD provides service may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on NGD’s ability to operate.From time to time, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which NGD does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on NGD’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for NGD and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements. NGD and CES must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas marketed and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.NGD and CES compete primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with NGD and CES for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass NGD’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by NGD and CES as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Infrastructure Services’ and ESG’s operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.Infrastructure Services’ and ESG’s business results are dependent on a number of factors. The industries are competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should Infrastructure Services and ESG be unsuccessful in bidding contracts (e.g., federal Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for ESG), results of operations could be impacted. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by Infrastructure Services or ESG operate could adversely impact operating results. Infrastructure Services enters into a variety of contracts, some of which are fixed price. Other risks that could adversely affect Infrastructure Services include, but are not limited to: failure to properly construct pipeline infrastructure; loss of significant customers or a significant decline in related customer revenues; cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects; changes in the timing of projects; the inability to obtain materials and equipment required to perform services from suppliers and manufacturers; and changes in the market prices of oil and natural gas and state regulatory requirements that mandate pipeline replacement programs that would affect the demand for infrastructure construction and/or the project margin realized on projects. For ESG, other risks include, but are not limited to: discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs; 33the inability of customers to finance projects; failure to appropriately design, construct or operate projects; and cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects. In addition, Infrastructure Services has supported CenterPoint Energy’s utilities pursuant to service contracts.  In most instances, the ability to maintain these service contracts depends upon regulatory discretion, and there can be no assurance it will be able to obtain future service contracts, or that existing arrangements will not be revisited.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements.ESG’s business has performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by CenterPoint Energy. In the normal course of business, ESG issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations. As the parent company, CenterPoint Energy has and will from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries’ commitments. These guaranties do not represent incremental consolidated obligations; rather, they represent parental guaranties of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral.  Neither CenterPoint Energy nor Vectren has been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guaranties. Risk Factors
 Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP (CenterPoint Energy) CenterPoint Energy holds a substantial limited partner interest in Enable (53.7% of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Enable as of December 31, 2019), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable GP and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP. As of December 31, 2019, CenterPoint Energy owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Enable Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable.  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy’s future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions it receives from Enable and the value of its interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors
” that are applicable to Enable.CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects or if it reduces its ownership in Enable.Both CenterPoint Energy and OGE hold their limited partner interests in Enable in the form of common units. CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units.  For the Enable Series A Preferred Units, Enable is expected to pay $0.625 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.50 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis. However, distributions on each Enable Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are non-cumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Enable Series A Preferred Units. Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to Enable GP and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”). Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it (i) to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units or (ii) maintain or increase the distributions on its common units. Additionally, distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common units. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;34•the level of competition from other companies offering midstream services;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:•the level and timing of its capital expenditures;•the cost of acquisitions;•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by Enable GP; •distributions paid on the Enable Series A Preferred Units; •any impact on cash levels should any sale of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable occur, as discussed further below; and•other business risks affecting its cash levels. Additionally, although it has no current plan to do so, CenterPoint Energy may also reduce its ownership in Enable over time through sales in the public equity markets, or otherwise, of the Enable common units it holds, subject to market conditions. CenterPoint Energy’s ability to execute any sale of Enable common units is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the timing, pricing and terms of any such sale.  Any sales of Enable common units CenterPoint Energy owns could have an adverse impact on the price of Enable common units or on any trading market for Enable common units. Further, CenterPoint Energy’s sales of Enable common units may have an adverse impact on Enable’s ability to issue equity on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand operations or make future acquisitions. Any reduction in CenterPoint Energy’s interest in Enable would result in decreased distributions from Enable and decrease income, which may adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its payment obligations and pay dividends on its Common Stock. Further, any sales of Enable common units would result in a significant amount of taxes due, which could also significantly impact CenterPoint Energy’s determination to execute any sale. There can be no assurances that any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise will be completed. Any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise may involve significant costs and expenses, including, in connection with any public offering, a significant underwriting discount.  CenterPoint Energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from any completed sale or reduction in its investment in Enable. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, including following certain changes in the methodology employed by rating agencies whereby the Enable Series A Preferred Units are no longer eligible for the same or a higher amount of “equity credit” attributed to the Enable Series A Preferred Units on their original issue date (referred to as a “rating event”), Enable has the option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurances that CenterPoint Energy will be able to reinvest any proceeds from such redemption in a manner that provides for a similar rate of return as the Enable Series A Preferred Units.35The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to CenterPoint Energy on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units, depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.Enable is required to, or may at its option, redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units if required to do so.As a holder of the Enable Series A Preferred Units, CenterPoint Energy may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE. If Enable is unable to list the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of the Enable Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.Additionally, Enable may redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units under certain circumstances, including following a rating event. Upon a rating event, the Enable Series A Preferred Units may be considered by Enable to be an expensive form of indebtedness.  If Enable does not have sufficient funds to exercise its option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units upon a rating event, then such inability could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.Enable is controlled jointly by CenterPoint Energy and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in Enable GP.  The board of directors of Enable GP is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by CenterPoint Energy, the president and chief executive officer of Enable GP and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE.  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable.Although CenterPoint Energy jointly controls Enable with OGE, CenterPoint Energy may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject it to claims that CenterPoint Energy has breached its fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.CenterPoint Energy and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable GP, as well as limited partner interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP.  CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units. Conflicts of interest may arise between CenterPoint Energy and Enable and its unitholders. CenterPoint Energy’s joint control of Enable GP may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary or contractual duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable. In resolving these conflicts, CenterPoint Energy may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement. These circumstances could subject CenterPoint Energy to claims that, in favoring its own interests and those of its affiliates, CenterPoint Energy breached a fiduciary or contractual duty to Enable or its unitholders.Enable is subject to various operational risks, all of which could affect Enable’s ability to make cash distributions to CenterPoint Energy. The execution of Enable’s businesses is subject to a number of operational risks, which include, but are not limited to, the following: •Contract Renewal: Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected;•Customers: Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing revenues and its transportation and storage revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers or the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation 36and storage services and adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions;•Third-Party Drilling and Production Decisions: Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the natural gas and crude oil drilling and production market conditions and decisions of others, over which Enable has no control. Further, sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation and fluctuations in energy prices could lead to further reductions in the utilization of Enable’s systems, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. It may also become more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems and in its processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time; •Competition: Enable competes with similar enterprises, some of which include public and private energy companies with greater financial resources and access to natural gas, NGL and crude oil supplies, in its respective areas of operation, primarily through rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Increased competitive pressure in Enable’s industry, which is already highly competitive, could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; •Cost Recovery of Capital Improvements: Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately $160 million to $240 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately $110 million to $130 million for the year ending December 31, 2020; •Commodity Prices: Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Factors affecting prices are beyond Enable’s control and include the following: (i) demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, (ii) the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, (iii) actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, (iv) the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, (v) the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, (vi) the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and (vii) the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. Further, Enable’s natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. In 2019, 4%, 26% and 70% of Enable’s processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. If the price at which Enable sells natural gas or NGLs is less than the cost at which Enable purchases natural gas or NGLs under these arrangements, then Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected; •Credit Risk of Customers: Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers, whether through severe financial problems or otherwise, could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; •“Negotiated Rate” Contracts: Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts, which are authorized by the FERC, that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform these services exceeds the revenues received from these contracts. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 37% of Enable’s aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity on EGT and MRT and 93% of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity on EGT and MRT, was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts. The majority of Enable’s aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity and all of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity under negotiated rate contracts on MRT are subject to the FERC’s rate case approval. As a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under these contracts, and if Enable’s costs increase and it is not able to recover any shortfall of revenue associated with its negotiated rate contracts, the cash flow realized by its systems could decrease and, therefore, the cash Enable has available for distribution could also decrease; 37•Unavailability of Interconnected Facilities: If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities (including those providing transportation of natural gas and crude oil, transportation and fractionation of NGLs and electricity for compression, among other things) become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected; and •Land Ownership: Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate, which could disrupt its operations or result in increased costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Enbridge Inc., DCP Midstream, LP, CVR Energy, Inc., Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:•Enable shares certain approval rights over major decisions and may not be able to control decisions, including control of cash distributions to Enable from the joint venture;•Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners, including leaving Enable liable for the other joint venture partners’ shares of joint venture liabilities if those partners do not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations;•Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;•Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;•Enable’s joint venture partners may take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and•disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.Under certain circumstances, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable’s ownership interest in SESH at fair market value. Enable owns a 50% ownership interest in SESH. The remaining 50% ownership interest is held by Enbridge Inc. CenterPoint Energy owns 53.7% of Enable’s common units, 100% of the Enable Series A Preferred Units and a 40% economic interest in Enable GP. Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of SESH, as amended, if, at any time, CenterPoint 38Energy has a right to receive less than 50% of Enable’s distributions through its interests in Enable and Enable GP, or do not have the ability to exercise certain control rights, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable’s interest in SESH at fair market value, subject to certain exceptions.Enable’s ability to grow is dependent in part on its ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely significantly upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. To the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally or through internally generated cash flows, Enable’s cash distribution policy may significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.Enable depends, in part, on access to the capital markets and other external financing sources to fund its expansion capital expenditures, although it has also increasingly relied on cash flow generated from operations. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable’s common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.As of December 31, 2019, Enable had approximately $4.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums, discounts and unamortized debt expense on their senior notes, $155 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $250 million outstanding under the Enable Oklahoma Intrastate Transmission, LLC 6.25% senior notes due 2020, excluding unamortized premium. Enable has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, with no borrowings outstanding, of which approximately $1.59 billion in borrowing capacity was available as of December 31, 2019. As of January 31, 2020, Enable had $119 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $1.63 billion of available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility. Enable has the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.Further, any reductions in Enable’s credit ratings could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships. Enable cannot assure that its credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a 39rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If any of Enable’s credit ratings are below investment grade, it may have higher future borrowing costs, and Enable or its subsidiaries may be required to post cash collateral or letters of credit under certain contractual agreements. If cash collateral requirements were to occur at a time when Enable was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;•dispose of assets;•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and•change the nature of its business.Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.Enable’s businesses are exposed to various regulatory risks.  Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. This regulation includes, but is not limited to, the following:  •Rate Regulation: The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural gas transportation services and crude oil gathering services. The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer.•FERC Revised Policy Statement and NOPR: In a series of related issuances on March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement stating that it will no longer permit pipelines organized as MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. On July 18, 2018, FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in a March 15, 2018 NOPR implementing the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with certain clarifications and modifications. For more information, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. If FERC requires Enable to establish new tariff rates for either its natural gas or crude oil pipelines that reflect a lower federal corporate income tax rate, it is possible the rates would be reduced, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders. With regard to FERC-jurisdictional 40rates on Enable’s crude oil pipelines, the FERC plans to address the Revised Policy Statement and corporate tax rate reduction in its next five-year review of the oil pipeline rate index, which will occur in 2020 and become effective July 1, 2021. The potential rate impacts from the revision are currently uncertain. •Permits, Licenses and Approvals: Enable may be unable to obtain or renew federal or state permits, licenses or approvals necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable’s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. Further, to obtain new permits or renew permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to potential adverse impact of a proposed project. Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be expensive and may significantly lengthen the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations and consequently could disrupt Enable’s project construction schedules; •Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation: Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection wells could result in reductions or delays in natural gas or crude oil production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; and •Jurisdictional Characterization of Assets: Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation systems are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, and its crude oil gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under ICA. FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. Natural gas gathering and intrastate crude oil gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.Other Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses and/or CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPThe success of the Merger depends, in part, on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to realize anticipated benefits and conduct an effective integration process. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to realize the expected benefits in the anticipated timeframe, including operating efficiencies, growth opportunities, cost savings and customer retention, from integrating CenterPoint Energy’s and Vectren’s businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services. The integration process could be complex, costly and time consuming, including the diversion of significant management time and resources thereto, and may result in the following challenges, among other things: •unanticipated delays, disruptions, issues or costs in integrating operations, financial and accounting, information technology, communications and other systems;  •inconsistencies in procedures, practices, policies, controls, and standards;  •differences in compensation arrangements, management perspectives and corporate culture; and  •loss of or difficulties retaining talented employees or valuable third-party relationships.  CenterPoint Energy must also successfully adapt its systems of internal controls to continue to accurately provide reliable financial reports, including reporting of its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If CenterPoint Energy’s efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls throughout integration are not successful, it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial reporting and processes in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, CenterPoint Energy’s operating results could be harmed or it may fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in CenterPoint Energy’s reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading prices of its securities.  41Even with the successful integration of the businesses, CenterPoint Energy may not achieve the expected results or economic benefits, including any expected revenue or synergy opportunities. Failure to fully realize the anticipated benefits could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enable’s reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our and Enable’s business, which includes, among other things, (i) managing operations and other business processes and (ii) protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. For example, the operation of our electric generation, transmission and distribution systems are dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our systems and third-party systems. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of the intelligent grid, smart devices and operational technologies across our businesses. Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyber-attack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems. Similarly, our and Enable’s business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enable’s pipeline facilities and third-party systems. The gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enable’s facilities. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets.Cyber-attacks, including phishing attacks and threats from the use of malicious code such as malware, ransomware and viruses, and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber-attacks and unauthorized access. Neither we nor Enable are fully insured against all cyber-security risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.As domestic and global cyber threats are on-going and increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, our and Enable’s critical energy infrastructure may be targets of state-sponsored attacks, terrorist activities or otherwise that could disrupt our respective business operations. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities, restore service  and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.In connection with our businesses, we and our vendors, suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information (e.g., information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and data privacy is increasingly demanding. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions and other legal requirements could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and penalties and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, steam electric generating facilities 42and electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:•restricting the way we manage hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, including wastewater discharges and air emissions;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•limiting airborne emissions from electric generating facilities, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2) and mercury, and the disposal non-hazardous substances such as CCRs, among other things; •restricting the use of fossil fuels through future climate legislation or regulation;•imposing requirements on or restricting the operations of facilities under the terms of permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of fossil fuels, including, but not limited to, natural gas.To comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations or purchase emissions allowances;•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•decommission or remediate waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, revocation of permits, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean, restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.In April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non­‑hazardous material under the RCRA. Under the CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to complete integrity assessments and groundwater monitoring studies. In January 2018, Indiana Electric completed its first annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report. This report identified localized impacts to groundwater near Indiana Electric’s coal impoundments. Further analysis is ongoing. In October 2018, Indiana Electric completed the CCR Rule’s required evaluation of the placement of Indiana Electric’s coal ash ponds. Indiana Electric completed its evaluation and determined that one F.B. Culley pond (Culley East) and the A.B. Brown pond fail the aquifer placement location restriction. As a result of this failure, Indiana Electric must cease disposal of new ash in the ponds and commence closure of the ponds by August 31, 2020. Indiana Electric plans to seek extensions available under the CCR Rule that would allow it to continue to use the ponds through December 31, 2023. The inability to obtain these extensions may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric’s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding including imposition of fines and penalties. Further, a release of coal ash that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to health of the environment could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs and reputational damage, all of which could adversely affect the financial condition of Indiana Electric. 43The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have insurance in place, such as general liability and property insurance, to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to fully cover or restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Costs, damages and other liabilities related to recent events and incidents that affected other utilities, such as wildfires and explosions, among other things, have exceeded or could exceed such utilities’ insurance coverage. Further, as a result of these recent events and incidents, the marketplace for insurance coverage may be unavailable or limited in capacity or any such available coverage may be deemed by us to be cost prohibitive under current conditions. Any such coverage, if available, may not be eligible for recovery, whether in full or in part, by us through the rates charged by our utility businesses.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and believes insurance capacity to be limited. Historically, Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise.  In the future, any such recovery may not be granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our operations and Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in their respective businesses of gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil and the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, including:•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties; •inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles and farm and utility equipment; •leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and •other safety hazards affecting our operations. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our or Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we or Enable operate could have a material adverse effect on our or Enable’s operations.Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. 44Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols;•the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •information technology or financial and billing system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, ice storms, terrorism, wildfires, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, including any environmental impacts related thereto, which catastrophic events may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Our and Enable’s success depends upon our and Enable’s ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We and Enable depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our and Enable’s success depends on our and Enable’s ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. On February 19, 2020, our president and chief executive officer resigned from CenterPoint Energy. As a result of this departure, our board of directors is currently conducting a search to fill the role of chief executive officer. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our and Enable’s operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our and Enable’s management team, our and Enable’s future success depends in part on our and Enable’s ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our and Enable’s strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our and Enable’s results of operations.Our and Enable’s businesses are dependent on recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our and Enable’s costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our and Enable’s businesses. If we and Enable are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our and Enable’s results of operations could be negatively affected. Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our or Enable’s services, including certain local initiatives to prohibit new NGD service and increase electrification initiatives.Regulatory agencies have adopted, and from time to time consider adopting, new legislation and/or modifying existing laws and regulations, to reduce GHGs, and there continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and 45internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation.  Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues.In August 2018, the EPA proposed a CPP replacement rule, the ACE Rule, which was finalized in July 2019 and requires states to implement a program of energy efficiency improvement targets for individual coal-fired electric generating units. States have three years to develop state plans to implement the ACE Rule, and we do not expect a state ACE plan to be finalized and approved by the EPA until 2024. We are currently unable to predict the effect of a state plan to implement the ACE Rule but do not anticipate that such a plan would have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, the ACE Rule is currently subject to legal challenges.  At this time, we are unable to determine what effect, if any, the legal challenges will have on the ACE Rule. Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements. These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, NGD’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. Additionally, Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses’ revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services. For further discussion, see “— Risk Factors
 Affecting Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Energy Services Businesses —NGD and CES must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas marketed and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.”Moreover, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation and NGD businesses. For example, because Indiana Electric’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations, certain financial institutions choose not to participate in CenterPoint Energy’s financing arrangements. Also, certain cities in CenterPoint Energy’s NGD operational footprint have adopted initiatives to prohibit the construction of new NGD facilities that would provide service and focus on electrification. For example, Minneapolis has adopted carbon emission reduction goals in an effort to decrease reliance on fossil gas. Also, Minnesota cities may consider seeking legislative authority for the ability to enact voluntary enhanced energy standards for all development projects. Any such initiatives and legislation could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations.Climate changes could adversely impact financial results from our and Enable’s businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events that could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories. If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our and Enable’s businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes or ice storms.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs. To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Any such decreased energy use may also require us to retire current infrastructure that is no longer needed. Further, we may be subject to climate change lawsuits, which could result in substantial penalties or damages. NGD and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs. Certain of NGD’s and Enable’s pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations. The DOT’s PHMSA has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures, for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a 46leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require pipeline operators, including NGD and Enable, to, among other things:•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;•develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; •identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area; •improve data collection, integration, and analysis;•develop processes for performance management, record keeping, management of change and communication; •repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and •implement preventive and mitigating action. Failure to comply with PHMSA or analogous state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences that may have an adverse effect on NGD’s and Enable’s operations. Both NGD and Enable incur significant costs associated with their compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations, which may not be recoverable in rates.Changes to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on NGD and Enable. Changes to pipeline safety regulations occur frequently. For example, PHMSA published a final rule in October 2019 that extends and expands the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements (e.g., period assessments, leak detection and repairs) regardless of proximity to a high consequence area. The adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require us and Enable to incur increased and potentially significant operational costs.Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets, including the failure of equipment or processes and potential breakdowns due to such aging. The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs because of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely and full recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. In addition, the nature of information available on aging infrastructure assets may make inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Further, with respect to NGD’s operations, if certain pipeline replacements (for example, cast-iron or bare steel pipe) are not completed timely or successfully, government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires, explosions or leaks. Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event that a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. We have several separate bargaining units, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described below: •The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 66 related to employees of Houston Electric is scheduled to expire in May 2020, for which negotiations are anticipated to begin in March 2020;  •The collective bargaining agreements with USW Locals 13-227 and 13-1 related to NGD’s employees in Texas are scheduled to expire in June 2022 and July 2022, respectively; •The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union Local 340, IBEW Local 949 and OPEIU Local 12 and Mankato related to NGD employees in Minnesota are scheduled to expire in April 2020, December 2020, May 2021 and March 2021, respectively, and negotiations with Gas Workers Union Local 340 are currently in progress and expected to be completed before the April 2020 expiration; 47•The collective bargaining agreements with IBEW Local 1393, USW Locals 12213 and 7441 related to employees of NGD in Indiana are scheduled to expire in December 2020; •The collective bargaining agreements with the Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union Local 135 and Utility Workers Union Local 175 related to employees of Indiana Electric were recently renegotiated and are scheduled to expire in September 2021 and October 2021, respectively; and  •The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 702 related to employees of Indiana Electric is scheduled to expire in June 2022.Additionally, Infrastructure Services negotiates various trade agreements through contractor associations.  The two primary associations are the DCA and the PLCA.  These trade agreements are with a variety of construction unions including Laborer’s International Union of North America, International Union of Operating Engineers, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, and Teamsters.  The trade agreements have varying expiration dates in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In addition, these subsidiaries have various project agreements and small local agreements.  These agreements expire upon completion of a specific project or on various dates throughout the year.Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change. We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant investments and expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar, microturbines, fuel cells), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce energy consumption and waste. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, including Indiana Electric’s generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner, to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our or Enable’s potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected.From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings.  However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our and Enable’s future growth may be adversely affected.On February 3, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through VUSI, entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement to sell the businesses within its Infrastructure Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020.  For 48further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements. We can make no assurances regarding the completion of this sale, which could be subject to delays or otherwise not consummated.Additionally, on February 24, 2020, CenterPoint Energy, through its subsidiary CERC Corp., entered into the Equity Purchase Agreement to sell CES, which represents substantially all of the businesses within the Energy Services reportable segment. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. For further information, see Notes 6 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements. We can make no assurances regarding the completion of this sale, which could be subject to delays or otherwise not consummated. As discussed in Note 16(d) to the consolidated financial statements, the existing CERC Corp. guarantees supporting CES’s obligations under natural gas supply, transportation and storage contracts will not terminate upon closing of the transaction.  While the buyer has an obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to cause CERC Corp. to be released from the guarantees as of and following closing, if the buyer is unable to do so, CERC Corp. would continue to have significant exposure under the guarantees. Following closing, if CES were to default on the payment obligations still guaranteed by CERC Corp., CERC Corp. could be obligated for such amounts. Further, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt our or Enable’s ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.    We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 16 to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial results. The Registrants could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that they have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, the Registrants could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a predecessor of Houston Electric, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn) and Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), those companies and/or their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of the Registrants. Such indemnities have applied in various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time and cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets, including in the gas market manipulation cases described in Note 16(e) to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. However, because of the settlement and discharge of certain of GenOn’s indemnity obligations in 2019 in 49its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the Registrants will no longer have the benefit of any settled or discharged indemnities and could incur liabilities in matters that previously would have been indemnified.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and CenterPoint Energy would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by CenterPoint Energy, and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits CenterPoint Energy has agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by CenterPoint Energy, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate.We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors such as unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories and changes in customers’ perceptions from recent incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives, use of alternative technologies and changes in our customers’ perceptions regarding natural gas usage as a result of recent incidents of other utilities involving natural gas pipelines, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Declines in demand for natural gas in NGD’s territories due to recent pipeline incidents of other utilities and for electricity as a result of economic downturns in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.For example, Houston Electric’s business is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. Although Houston, Texas has a diverse economy, employment in the energy industry remains important with overall Houston employment growing at a moderate rate in 2019 among various sectors. Further, the operations of Vectren’s utility businesses are concentrated in central and southern Indiana and west-central Ohio and are therefore impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest.  These industries include automotive assembly, parts and accessories; feed, flour and grain processing; metal castings, plastic products; gypsum products; electrical equipment, metal specialties, glass and steel finishing; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining. In the event economic conditions further decline, the respective rates of growth in Houston, Indiana and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate. Changing market conditions, including changing regulation, changes in market prices of oil or other commodities, or changes in government regulation and assistance, may cause certain industrial customers to reduce or cease production and thereby decrease consumption of natural gas and/or electricity. Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition. Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and 50negative public perceptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows"
8,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2019-02-28,"Risk Factors
 CenterPoint Energy is a holding company that conducts all of its business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric, CERC and, as of February 1, 2019, Vectren through its operating subsidiaries. CenterPoint Energy also owns interests in Enable. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this combined report on Form 10-K, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the holding company, the businesses conducted by its subsidiaries, including Vectren, and its interests in Enable. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s businesses. Carefully consider each of the risks described below relating to Houston Electric and CERC, which, along with CenterPoint Energy (including Vectren for purposes of this Item 1A only), are collectively referred to as the Registrants. Unless the context indicates otherwise, where appropriate, information relating to a specific registrant has been segregated and labeled as such and specific references to Houston Electric and CERC in this section also pertain to CenterPoint Energy. In this combined report on Form 10-K, the terms “our,” “we” and “us” are used as abbreviated references to CenterPoint Energy, Inc. together with its subsidiaries, which, as of February 1, 2019, includes Vectren and its subsidiaries. 19Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionCenterPoint Energy is a holding company with no operations or operating assets of its own. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on the performance of and distributions from its subsidiaries and from Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions. CenterPoint Energy derives all of its operating income from, and holds all of its assets through, its subsidiaries, including its interests in Enable. As a result, CenterPoint Energy depends on distributions from its subsidiaries and Enable to meet its payment obligations and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock. In general, CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide it with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit CenterPoint Energy’s subsidiaries’ and Enable’s ability to make payments or other distributions to CenterPoint Energy, and its subsidiaries or Enable could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.  Additionally, CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations, future growth and earnings and dividend goals will depend on the performance of its utility and non-utility (such as CES, Infrastructure Services and ESG) subsidiaries which contribute to a portion of its consolidated earnings and which may not perform at expected or forecasted levels or do not achieve the projected growth in these businesses as anticipated. CenterPoint Energy and CERC also offer home repair protection plans to natural gas customers in Texas (through a third-party provider) and provide home appliance maintenance and repair services to customers in Minnesota. For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions CenterPoint Energy receives with respect to its interests in Enable, please read “— Additional Risk Factors
 Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects.” CenterPoint Energy’s right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be structurally subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if CenterPoint Energy were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be effectively subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by CenterPoint Energy.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to finance our capital expenditures or refinance outstanding indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive, and we rely on various sources to finance our capital expenditures. For example, we depend on (i) long-term debt, (ii) borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and, for CenterPoint Energy and CERC, commercial paper programs, (iii) distributions from CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable (CenterPoint Energy may also depend on the net proceeds from a sale of a portion of Enable common units it owns) and (iv) if market conditions permit, issuances of additional shares of common and/or preferred stock by CenterPoint Energy.  We may also use such sources to refinance any outstanding indebtedness as it matures.  As of December 31, 2018, CenterPoint Energy had $9.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $1.4 billion of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. For information on maturities through 2023, see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2018, Vectren and its subsidiaries had outstanding $167 million of short-term debt and $2.2 billion of long-term debt, including current maturities. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enable’s units or volatility in Enable’s unit price;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•the future performance of our and Enable’s businesses;•integration of Vectren’s businesses into CenterPoint Energy;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;20•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2018, Houston Electric had approximately $3.3 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including approximately $68 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, Houston Electric had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, up to 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $4.3 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2018. However, Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. In January 2019, Houston Electric issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds. As of December 31, 2018, Indiana Electric had approximately $293 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding. Indiana Electric may issue additional bonds under its Mortgage Indenture up to 60% of currently unfunded property additions. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.0 billion of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued on this basis. However, under certain circumstances Indiana Electric is limited in its ability to issue additional bonds under the Mortgage Indenture due to a provision in its parent’s, VUHI, indentures.The Registrants’ current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. On January 28, 2019, in anticipation of the closing of the Merger, Moody’s downgraded the long-term credit ratings of CenterPoint Energy, including its issuer rating to Baa2 from Baa1, senior unsecured debt rating to Baa2 from Baa1, subordinated debt rating to Baa3 from Baa2 and preferred stock rating to Ba1 from Baa3 while affirming its Prime‐2 short-term rating for commercial paper and A1 senior secured revenue bonds. Moody’s also changed the rating outlook for CenterPoint Energy to stable from negative. On February 1, 2019, as a result of the closing of the Merger, S&P lowered its issuer credit rating on CenterPoint Energy to BBB+ from A-, and lowered the credit ratings for CenterPoint Energy’s senior unsecured and subordinated notes to BBB from BBB+ and the Series A Preferred Stock to BBB- from BBB.  S&P also removed the CenterPoint Energy ratings from CreditWatch, where S&P had previously placed them with negative implications as a result of the announcement of the Merger in the second quarter of 2018 and changed its outlook to stable. S&P also lowered its issuer credit ratings on Houston Electric and CERC to BBB+ from A-.  S&P affirmed the A credit rating on Houston Electric’s first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds and lowered the credit rating on CERC’s senior unsecured debt to BBB+ from A-.  S&P also removed the Houston Electric and CERC ratings from CreditWatch, where S&P had previously placed them with negative implications as a result of the announcement of the Merger in the second quarter of 2018 and changed its outlook to stable. S&P also affirmed the A-2 short-term and commercial paper ratings for CenterPoint Energy and CERC. The Registrants note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold their securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of the Registrants’ credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on their ability to access capital on acceptable terms. An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments and an impairment or fair value adjustment to CenterPoint Energy’s Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment could reduce our earnings.Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require CenterPoint Energy to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, if Enable’s common unit price, distributions or earnings were to decline, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, CenterPoint Energy could determine that it is unable to recover the carrying value of its equity investment in Enable. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in CenterPoint Energy recording impairment charges in the future. For investments CenterPoint Energy accounts for as investments without a readily determinable fair value, such as the Enable Series A Preferred Unit investment, the carrying value of the asset may be adjusted to fair value, resulting in a gain or loss in the 21period, if a transaction on an identical or similar investment in Enable is observed.  Additionally, CenterPoint Energy considers qualitative impairment triggers, such as significant deterioration in earnings performance, significant decline in market condition and other factors that raise significant concerns about Enable’s ability to continue as a going concern, to determine if an impairment analysis should be performed on its investment. Further, as a result of the Merger, CenterPoint Energy will have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets on its consolidated financial statements that are subject to impairment based on future adverse changes to its business or prospects. Should the annual impairment test or another periodic impairment test or an observable transaction, as described above, indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A non-cash impairment charge or fair value adjustment could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.Changing demographics, poor investment performance of pension plan assets and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.CenterPoint Energy and its subsidiaries maintain qualified defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees. Costs associated with these plans are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, contributions to the plan, and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and CenterPoint Energy may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations, or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting CenterPoint Energy’s funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.Vectren also contributes to several multi-employer pension plans for Infrastructure Services.  If Infrastructure Services withdraws from these plans, CenterPoint Energy may be required to pay an amount based on the allocable share of the plans’ unfunded vested benefits, referred to as the withdrawal liability. This could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees may increase substantially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We provide health care benefits to eligible employees and retirees through self-insured plans. In recent years, the costs of providing these benefits per beneficiary increased due to higher health care costs and higher levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims. We anticipate that such costs will continue to rise. Further, the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our health care benefit programs and costs. Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts, which are likely to be passed on to us, cannot be determined with certainty at this time. Our costs of providing these benefits could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by the Registrants or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact the Registrants’ results of operations and those of Enable.The Registrants use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risks. The Registrants or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. Additionally, in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.If CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, its ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact its cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. CenterPoint Energy has approximately $828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31, 2018. CenterPoint Energy owns shares of ZENS-Related Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate 22its obligation to the holders of the ZENS. CenterPoint Energy may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($93 million in the aggregate, or $6.57 per ZENS, as of December 31, 2018) or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event CenterPoint Energy redeems the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, it would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  CenterPoint Energy’s ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31, 2018, deferred taxes of approximately $438 million would have been payable in 2018, based on 2018 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of ZENS-Related Securities had been sold on December 31, 2018 to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $90 million would have been payable in 2018. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows. This could happen if CenterPoint Energy’s creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of ZENS-Related Securities that CenterPoint Energy owns or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and ZENS-Related Securities shares would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged and ZENS-Related Securities shares are sold.Dividend requirements associated with the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock that CenterPoint Energy issued to fund a portion of the Merger subject it to certain risks.In August 2018, CenterPoint Energy issued 800,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. In October 2018, CenterPoint Energy  issued 19,550,000 depositary shares, each representing a 1/20th interest in a share of CenterPoint Energy’s Series B Preferred Stock. Any future payments of cash dividends, and the amount of any cash dividends CenterPoint Energy pays, on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock will depend on, among other things, its financial condition, capital requirements and results of operations and the ability of our subsidiaries and Enable to distribute cash to CenterPoint Energy, as well as other factors that CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) may consider relevant. Any failure to pay scheduled dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock when due would likely have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series B Preferred Stock, Common Stock and CenterPoint Energy’s debt securities and would prohibit CenterPoint Energy, under the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing shares of Common Stock (subject to limited exceptions) until such time as CenterPoint Energy has paid all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock.The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock further provide that if dividends on any of the respective shares have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of three or more semi-annual or six or more quarterly dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such shares, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other series of CenterPoint Energy’s capital stock on parity with its Series A Preferred Stock or its Series B Preferred Stock (as to the payment of dividends and amounts payable on liquidation, dissolution or winding up of CenterPoint Energy’s affairs) upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will be entitled to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of CenterPoint Energy’s Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations.Risk Factors
 Affecting Electric Generation, Transmission and Distribution Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and Houston Electric)Rate regulation of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s businesses may delay or deny their ability to earn an expected return and fully recover their costs.Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT and Indiana Electric’s rates are regulated by the IURC. Their rates are set in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) based on an analysis of their invested capital, their expenses and other factors in a designated test year. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s control. For Houston Electric, a general base rate proceeding is required 48 months from the date of the last general base rate change, unless the PUCT issues an order extending the deadline to file that general base rate proceeding. In connection with the PUCT’s review of the impacts of the TCJA, on February 13, 2018, Houston Electric and other likely parties to a future rate case announced a settlement that, among other things, requires Houston Electric to make a general rate case filing by April 30, 2019. There is no guarantee that current rates will continue or that the general rate case will result in rates that fully recover Houston Electric’s costs or enable it to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. The rates that Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are allowed to charge may not match their costs at any given time, a situation referred to as “regulatory lag.” For Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, these adjustment mechanisms are subject to the 23applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For example, for Houston Electric, the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utility’s rates for increases in net distribution-invested capital (e.g., distribution plant and distribution-related intangible plant and communication equipment) since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding, but Houston Electric may only make a DCRF filing once per calendar year and not during a comprehensive base rate proceeding. The TCOS mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital, but is only available to Houston Electric twice per calendar year. However, neither of these mechanisms provides for recovery of operations and maintenance expenses.  Similarly, for Indiana Electric, the TDSIC rate mechanism allows electric utilities (that have an IURC-approved seven-year infrastructure improvement plan) to request incremental rate increases every six months to pay for the projects included in that plan, subject to IURC approval. However, the TDSIC allows the utility to recover 80% of the cost as they are incurred, with the remaining costs to be deferred as regulatory assets until the next base rate case, and rate increases are limited to no more than 2% of the utility’s total retail revenues from the prior year. Indiana Electric recovers transmission costs through a FERC-approved formula rate and reflects charges and costs associated with participation in MISO through the Reliability Cost and Revenue Adjustment and MISO Cost and Recovery Adjustment mechanisms, which are filed annually. With respect to the DSMA, electricity suppliers are required to submit energy efficiency plans to the IURC at least once every three years and may file under the DSMA mechanism annually to recover program and administrative costs, including lost revenues and financial incentives. The DSMA is subject to IURC approval. Houston Electric and Indiana Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates or in full cost recovery. Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s costs or enable them to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s ability to recover their costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by Houston Electric or Indiana Electric and deny the full recovery of their cost of service in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, their results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. Unlike Houston Electric, Indiana Electric must seek approval by the IURC for long-term financing authority. This authority allows Indiana Electric the flexibility to issue debt securities, among other financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC does not approve Indiana Electric’s financing authority, Indiana Electric may not be able to fully execute its financing plans and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.  Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services.Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Similarly, Indiana Electric’s revenues are derived from rates it charges its customers to provide electricity. Thus, Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage. Houston Electric’s revenues are generally higher during the warmer months. Unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish Houston Electric’s results of operations and harm its financial condition. Conversely, extreme warm weather conditions could increase Houston Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.A significant portion of Indiana Electric’s sales are for space heating and cooling. Consequently, Indiana Electric’s results of operations may be adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather or colder-than-normal cooling season weather, while more extreme seasonal weather conditions could increase Indiana Electric’s results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.24Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, as a member of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, could be subject to higher costs for improvements, as well as fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric are members of ERCOT and MISO, respectively, which serve the electric transmission needs of their applicable regions. As a result of their respective participation in ERCOT and MISO, Houston Electric and Indiana Electric do not have operational control over their transmission facilities and are subject to certain costs for improvements to these regional electric transmission systems. In addition, the FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT and Indiana Electric and other utilities within MISO, respectively. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation and for reliability in the portion of MISO that includes Indiana Electric to ReliabilityFirst Corporation, a Delaware non-profit corporation. Compliance with mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric and Indiana Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. In addition, if Houston Electric or Indiana Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, they could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties. Houston Electric’s receivables are primarily concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2018, Houston Electric did business with approximately 65 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., formerly known as TCEH Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2018 was $207 million. Approximately 34% and 12% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP.  The AMS deployed throughout Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s service territories may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data.Houston Electric and Indiana Electric have deployed an AMS throughout their service territories, which integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers’ premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings for Houston Electric associated with a customer’s change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service. Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues, loss of data and factors outside the control of Houston Electric and Indiana Electric, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse effect on Houston Electric’s or Indiana Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Indiana Electric’s execution of its electric generation transition plan and its regulated power supply operations are subject to various risks, including timely recovery of capital investments, increased costs and facility outages or shutdowns. As required by Indiana regulation, Indiana Electric filed its 2016 IRP with the IURC in December 2016. Indiana requires each electric utility to perform and submit an IRP that uses economic modeling to consider the costs and risks associated with available resource options to provide reliable electric service for the next 20-year period. While the IURC does not approve or reject the IRP, the process involves the issuance of a staff report that provides comments on the IRP, which was issued in November 2017. Indiana Electric has taken the comments provided in the report into consideration in its generation resource plans. 25Consistent with the recommendations presented in Indiana Electric’s IRP and as a direct result of significant environmental investments required to comply with current regulations, Indiana Electric plans to retire a significant portion of its current generating fleet by the end of 2023. Indiana Electric’s electric generation transition plan will require recovery of new capital investments, as well as costs of retiring the current generation fleet, including decommissioning costs, costs of removal and any remaining unrecovered costs of retired assets. Currently, Indiana Electric relies on coal for substantially all of its generation capacity. In February 2018, Indiana Electric filed a petition seeking authorization from the IURC to construct a new 800-900 MW natural gas combined cycle generating facility to replace this capacity at an approximate cost of $900 million, which includes the cost of a new natural gas pipeline to serve the plant. Indiana Electric is requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing construction timelines and costs of new generation resources, as well as necessary unit retrofits, to implement the generation transition plan. Also, Indiana Electric is seeking approval to defer some capital costs associated with the generation plan until its next base rate proceeding and may use rate recovery mechanisms to recover other portions of the cost. Indiana Electric expects an order from the IURC in the certificate of public convenience and necessity proceeding in the first half of 2019. Given the significance of the plan, there is inherent risk associated with the construction of new generation, including the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, scarcity of resources and labor, ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation, the effects of potential construction delays and cost overruns and the ability to meet capacity requirements.Additionally, Indiana Electric’s generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased purchase power costs. These operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns due to equipment failure or operator error; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; or natural disasters. Further, Indiana Electric’s coal supply is purchased largely from a single, unrelated party and, although the coal supply is under long-term contract, the loss of this supplier or transportation interruptions could adversely affect Indiana Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting Natural Gas Distribution and Competitive Energy Services Businesses (CenterPoint Energy and CERC)Rate regulation of NGD may delay or deny its ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs.NGD’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions based on an analysis of NGD’s invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic) in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment. Each of these proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of NGD’s control. Thus, the rates that NGD is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.”Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce NGD’s ability to adjust its rates.Arkansas allows public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP, providing for a utility’s base rates to be adjusted once a year. In each of Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions. Additionally, in Minnesota, the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling program, which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers. Further, in Indiana, NGD may file a CSIA every six months to seek rate increases to recover certain federally mandated project costs (e.g., pipeline safety). The TDSIC (recovered through the CSIA), allows the utility to recover 80% of its project costs associated with an IURC-approved seven-year infrastructure improvement plan as they are incurred, with the remaining costs to be deferred until the next base rate case, and rate increases are limited to no more than 2% of the utility’s total retail revenues. In Ohio, the DRR is an annual mechanism that allows a utility to recover its investments in utility plant and operating expenses associated with replacing bare steel and cast-iron pipelines, as well as certain other infrastructure investments. The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body. In Texas, NGD’s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year. NGD must file a general rate case no later than five years after the initial GRIP implementation date.NGD can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will 26produce recovery of NGD’s costs or enable NGD to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact NGD’s ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGD’s cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Unlike CERC, Indiana Gas, SIGECO’s natural gas distribution business and VEDO must seek approval by the IURC and PUCO, as applicable, for long-term financing authority. This authority allows these utilities the flexibility to issue their debt securities, among other financing arrangements. In the event that the IURC or PUCO do not approve these utilities’ respective financing authorities, they may not be able to fully execute their financing plans and their respective financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.  Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for NGD’s customers.NGD depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy its customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. Substantially all of NGD’s natural gas supply is purchased from intrastate and interstate pipelines. If NGD is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet NGD’s requirements, the resulting decrease in natural gas supply in NGD’s service territories could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, acts of terrorism or cyber-attacks or changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, could also adversely affect NGD’s businesses. Further, to the extent that NGD’s natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then NGD’s operations could be negatively affected.NGD and CES, including transportation and storage, whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements, are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of their suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect their liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. NGD and CES are subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials that impact our business, including transportation and storage, whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements. Increases in natural gas prices might affect NGD’s and CES’s ability to collect balances due from their customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which NGD and CES operate, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that NGD’s and CES’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral required under hedging arrangements. AMAs may be subject to regulatory approval, and such agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed with less favorable terms.A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas, which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.NGD’s and CES’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.NGD’s and CES’s revenues are primarily derived from natural gas sales. Thus, their revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter 27months. Unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. Conversely, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The states in which NGD provides regulated local natural gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on NGD’s ability to operate.From time to time, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which NGD does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on NGD’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for NGD and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements. NGD and CES must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in less natural gas marketed and have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.NGD and CES compete primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with NGD and CES for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass NGD’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by NGD and CES as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Infrastructure Services’ and ESG’s operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.Infrastructure Services’ and ESG’s business results are dependent on a number of factors. The industries are competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should Infrastructure Services and ESG be unsuccessful in bidding contracts (e.g., federal Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for ESG), results of operations could be impacted. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work or issues arise where amounts due for work performed may not be collected, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the sectors in which the customers served by Infrastructure Services or ESG operate could adversely impact operating results. Infrastructure Services enters into a variety of contracts, some of which are fixed price. Other risks that could adversely affect Infrastructure Services include, but are not limited to: failure to properly construct pipeline infrastructure; loss of significant customers or a significant decline in related customer revenues; cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects; changes in the timing of projects; the inability to obtain materials and equipment required to perform services from suppliers and manufacturers; and changes in the market prices of oil and natural gas and state regulatory requirements that mandate pipeline replacement programs that would affect the demand for infrastructure construction and/or the project margin realized on projects. For ESG, other risks include, but are not limited to: discontinuation of the federal ESPC and UESC programs; the inability of customers to finance projects; risks associated with projects owned or operated; failure to appropriately design, construct or operate projects; and cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects. In addition, Vectren’s non-utility businesses have supported its utilities pursuant to service contracts by providing infrastructure services.  In most instances, Vectren’s ability to maintain these service contracts depends upon regulatory discretion, and there can be no assurance it will be able to obtain future service contracts, or that existing arrangements will not be revisited.ESG’s business has performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by Vectren. In the normal course of business, ESG issues performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit it to operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors and support warranty obligations. Vectren, as the parent company, will from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries’ commitments. These guaranties do not represent incremental consolidated obligations; rather, they 28represent parental guaranties of subsidiary obligations to allow the subsidiary the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral.  Vectren has not been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guaranties. As a result of the closing of the Merger, these guaranties would ultimately become obligations of CenterPoint Energy or its subsidiaries.Risk Factors
 Affecting CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP (CenterPoint Energy) CenterPoint Energy holds a substantial limited partner interest in Enable (54.0% of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Enable as of December 31, 2018), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable GP and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP. As of December 31, 2018, CenterPoint Energy owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Enable Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable.  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy’s future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions it receives from Enable and the value of its interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of CenterPoint Energy’s interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors
” that are applicable to Enable.CenterPoint Energy’s cash flows will be adversely impacted if it receives less cash distributions from Enable than it currently expects or if it reduces its ownership in Enable.Both CenterPoint Energy and OGE hold their limited partner interests in Enable in the form of common units. CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units.  For the Enable Series A Preferred Units, Enable is expected to pay $0.625 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.50 per Enable Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis. However, distributions on each Enable Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are non-cumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Enable Series A Preferred Units. Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to Enable GP and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”). Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it (i) to pay distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units or (ii) maintain or increase the distributions on its common units. Additionally, distributions on the Enable Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common units. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;•the level of competition from other companies offering midstream services;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:•the level and timing of its capital expenditures;•the cost of acquisitions;•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;29•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by Enable GP; •distributions paid on the Enable Series A Preferred Units; •any impact on cash levels should any sale of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable occur, as discussed further below; and•other business risks affecting its cash levels. Additionally, CenterPoint Energy may also reduce its ownership in Enable over time through sales in the public equity markets, or otherwise, of the Enable common units it holds, subject to market conditions. CenterPoint Energy’s ability to execute any sale of Enable common units is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the timing, pricing and terms of any such sale.  Any sales of Enable common units CenterPoint Energy owns could have an adverse impact on the price of Enable common units or on any trading market for Enable common units. Further, CenterPoint Energy’s sales of Enable common units may have an adverse impact on Enable’s ability to issue equity on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand operations or make future acquisitions. Any reduction in CenterPoint Energy’s interest in Enable would result in decreased distributions from Enable and decrease income, which may adversely impact CenterPoint Energy’s ability to meet its payment obligations and pay dividends on its Common Stock. Further, any sales of Enable common units would result in a significant amount of taxes due. There can be no assurances that any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise will be completed. Any sale of Enable common units in the public equity markets or otherwise may involve significant costs and expenses, including, in connection with any public offering, a significant underwriting discount.  CenterPoint Energy may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from any completed sale or reduction in its investment in Enable. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, including following certain changes in the methodology employed by ratings agencies whereby the Enable Series A Preferred Units are no longer eligible for the same or a higher amount of “equity credit” attributed to the Enable Series A Preferred Units on their original issue date (referred to as a “rating event”), Enable has the option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurances that CenterPoint Energy will be able to reinvest any proceeds from such redemption in a manner that provides for a similar rate of return as the Enable Series A Preferred Units.The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to CenterPoint Energy on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common units and the Enable Series A Preferred Units, depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.Enable is required to, or may at its option, redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units if required to do so.As a holder of the Enable Series A Preferred Units, CenterPoint Energy may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE. If Enable is unable to list the Enable Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of the Enable Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.Additionally, Enable may redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units under certain circumstances, including following a rating event. Upon a rating event, the Enable Series A Preferred Units may be considered by Enable to be an expensive form of indebtedness.  If Enable does not have sufficient funds to exercise its option to redeem the Enable Series A Preferred Units upon a rating event, then such inability could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.30CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.Enable is controlled jointly by CenterPoint Energy and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in Enable GP.  The board of directors of Enable GP is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by CenterPoint Energy, the president and chief executive officer of Enable GP and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE.  Accordingly, CenterPoint Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable.Although CenterPoint Energy jointly controls Enable with OGE, CenterPoint Energy may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject it to claims that CenterPoint Energy has breached its fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.CenterPoint Energy and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable GP, as well as limited partner interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable GP.  CenterPoint Energy also holds Enable Series A Preferred Units. Conflicts of interest may arise between CenterPoint Energy and Enable and its unitholders. CenterPoint Energy’s joint control of Enable GP may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary or contractual duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable. In resolving these conflicts, CenterPoint Energy may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement. These circumstances could subject CenterPoint Energy to claims that, in favoring its own interests and those of its affiliates, CenterPoint Energy breached a fiduciary or contractual duty to Enable or its unitholders.Enable is subject to various operational risks, all of which could affect Enable’s ability to make cash distributions to CenterPoint Energy. The execution of Enable’s businesses is subject to a number of operational risks, which include, but are not limited to, the following: •Contract Renewal: Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected;•Customers: Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing revenues and its transportation and storage revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers or the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation and storage services and adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions;•Third-Party Drilling and Production Decisions: Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the natural gas and crude oil drilling and production market conditions and decisions of others, over which Enable has no control. Further, sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation and fluctuations in energy prices could lead to further reductions in the utilization of Enable’s systems, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. It may also become more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems and in its processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time; •Competition: Enable competes with similar enterprises, some of which include large energy companies with greater financial resources and access to natural gas, NGL and crude oil supplies, in its respective areas of operation, primarily through rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Increased competitive pressure in Enable’s industry, which is already highly competitive, could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; •Cost Recovery of Capital Improvements: Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately $325 million to $425 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately $105 million to $125 million for the year ending December 31, 2019; 31•Commodity Prices: Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Factors affecting prices are beyond Enable’s control and include the following: (i) demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, (ii) the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, (iii) actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, (iv) the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, (v) the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, (vi) the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and (vii) the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. Further, Enable’s natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. In 2018, 6%, 27% and 67% of Enable’s processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. If the price at which Enable sells natural gas or NGLs is less than the cost at which Enable purchases natural gas or NGLs under these arrangements, then Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected; •Credit Risk of Customers: Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers, whether through severe financial problems or otherwise, could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; •“Negotiated Rate” Contracts: Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts, which are authorized by the FERC, that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform these services exceeds the revenues received from these contracts. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 44% of Enable’s aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity on EGT and MRT and 45% of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity on EGT and MRT, was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts. As a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under these contracts, and if Enable’s costs increase and it is not able to recover any shortfall of revenue associated with its negotiated rate contracts, the cash flow realized by its systems could decrease and, therefore, the cash Enable has available for distribution could also decrease; •Unavailability of Interconnected Facilities: If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities (including those providing transportation of natural gas and crude oil, transportation and fractionation of NGLs and electricity for compression, among others) become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected; and •Land Ownership: Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate, which could disrupt its operations or result in increased costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Enbridge Inc., DCP Midstream, LP, CVR Refining, LP, Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:•Enable shares certain approval rights over major decisions and may not be able to control decisions, including control of cash distributions to Enable from the joint venture;•Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners, including leaving Enable liable for the other joint venture partners’ shares of joint venture liabilities if those partners do not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations;32•Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;•Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;•Enable’s joint venture partners may take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and•disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.Under certain circumstances, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable’s ownership interest in SESH at fair market value. Enable owns a 50% ownership interest in SESH. The remaining 50% ownership interest is held by Enbridge Inc. CenterPoint Energy owns 54.0% of Enable’s common units, 100% of the Enable Series A Preferred Units and a 40% economic interest in Enable GP. Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of SESH, as amended, if, at any time, CenterPoint Energy has a right to receive less than 50% of Enable’s distributions through its interests in Enable and Enable GP, or do not have the ability to exercise certain control rights, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable’s interest in SESH at fair market value, subject to certain exceptions.Enable’s ability to grow is dependent in part on its ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely significantly upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. To the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally or through internally generated cash flows, Enable’s cash distribution policy may significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.Enable depends, in part, on access to the capital markets and other external financing sources to fund its expansion capital expenditures, although it has also increasingly relied on cash flow generated from operations. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable’s common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.33Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.As of December 31, 2018, Enable had approximately $2.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums, discounts and unamortized debt expense on their senior notes, $649 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $500 million outstanding of its 2.40% senior notes dues 2019, excluding unamortized debt expense. Enable has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, with approximately $250 million in borrowings outstanding and $848 million remaining available as of February 1, 2019. Enable has the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.Further, any reductions in Enable’s credit ratings could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships. Enable cannot assure that its credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If any of Enable’s credit ratings are below investment grade, it may have higher future borrowing costs, and Enable or its subsidiaries may be required to post cash collateral or letters of credit under certain contractual agreements. If cash collateral requirements were to occur at a time when Enable was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;•dispose of assets;•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and•change the nature of its business.Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.34Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.Enable’s businesses are exposed to various regulatory risks.  Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. This regulation includes, but is not limited to, the following:  •Rate Regulation: The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural gas transportation services and crude oil gathering services. The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer.•FERC Revised Policy Statement and NOPR: In a series of related issuances on March 15, 2018, the FERC issued a Revised Policy Statement stating that it will no longer permit pipelines organized as MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their cost-of-service rates. On July 18, 2018, FERC issued a Final Rule adopting procedures that are generally the same as proposed in a March 15, 2018 NOPR implementing the Revised Policy Statement and the corporate income tax rate reduction with certain clarifications and modifications. For more information, please read “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report, which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. If FERC requires Enable to establish new tariff rates for either its natural gas or crude oil pipelines that reflect a lower federal corporate income tax rate, it is possible the rates would be reduced, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders. With regard to FERC-jurisdictional rates on Enable’s crude oil pipelines, the FERC plans to address the Revised Policy Statement and corporate tax rate reduction in its next five-year review of the oil pipeline rate index, which will occur in 2020 and become effective July 1, 2021. The potential rate impacts from the revision are currently uncertain. •Permits, Licenses and Approvals: Enable may be unable to obtain or renew federal or state permits, licenses or approvals necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable’s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. Further, to obtain new permits or renew permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to potential adverse impact of a proposed project. Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be expensive and may significantly lengthen the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations and consequently could disrupt Enable’s project construction schedules; •Hydraulic Fracturing Regulation: Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection wells could result in reductions or delays in natural gas or crude oil production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions; and •Jurisdictional Characterization of Assets: Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation systems are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, and its crude oil gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under ICA. FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. Natural gas gathering and intrastate crude oil gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.35Other Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses or CenterPoint Energy’s Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPThe success of the Merger depends, in part, on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to realize anticipated benefits and conduct an effective integration process. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on CenterPoint Energy’s ability to realize the expected benefits in the anticipated timeframe, including operating efficiencies, growth opportunities, cost savings and customer retention, from integrating CenterPoint Energy’s and Vectren’s businesses, while at the same time continuing to provide consistent, high quality services. The integration process could be complex, costly and time consuming, including the diversion of significant management time and resources thereto, and may result in the following challenges, among others: •unanticipated delays, disruptions, issues or costs in integrating operations, financial and accounting, information technology, communications and other systems;  •potential inconsistencies in procedures, practices, policies, controls, and standards;  •possible differences in compensation arrangements, management perspectives and corporate culture; and  •loss of or difficulties retaining talented employees or valuable third-party relationships.  CenterPoint Energy must also successfully integrate its systems of internal controls to accurately provide reliable financial reports, including reporting of its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If CenterPoint Energy’s efforts to integrate and maintain an effective system of internal controls are not successful, it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial reporting and processes in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, CenterPoint Energy’s operating results could be harmed or it may fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in CenterPoint Energy’s reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading prices of its securities.  Even with the successful integration of the businesses, CenterPoint Energy may not achieve the expected results or economic benefits, including any expected revenue or synergy opportunities. Failure to fully realize the anticipated benefits could adversely affect CenterPoint Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and have a negative effect on the trading prices of its securities. Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enable’s reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our and Enable’s business, which includes, among other things, (i) managing operations and other business processes and (ii) protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. For example, the operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our system. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of smart meters and the intelligent grid. Further, certain of the various internal systems we use to conduct our businesses are highly integrated. Consequently, a cyber-attack or unauthorized access in any one of these systems could potentially impact the other systems. Similarly, our and Enable’s business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enable’s pipeline facilities and third-party systems. The gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enable’s facilities. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets.Cyber-attacks and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive 36information, could also be targets of cyber-attacks and unauthorized access. Neither we nor Enable is fully insured against all cyber-security risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.As domestic and global cyber threats are on-going and increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, our and Enable’s critical energy infrastructure may be targets of terrorist activities or otherwise that could disrupt our respective business operations. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.In connection with our business we and our vendors, suppliers and contractors collect and retain personally identifiable information (e.g., information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we and such third parties will adequately protect that information. The U.S. regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. New laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including recent California legislation, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain or failure of our vendors, suppliers and contractors to use or maintain such data in accordance with contractual provisions could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines, litigation. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.We are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric generating facilities and electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:•restricting the way we manage hazardous and non-hazardous wastes;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action and monitoring to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•limiting airborne emissions from electric generating facilities, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and mercury, and the disposal non-hazardous substances such as coal combustion residuals, among others; •enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas.To comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations;•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•decommission or remediate waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining 37future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean, restore and monitor sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.In April 2015, the EPA finalized its CCR Rule, which regulates ash as non­hazardous material under the RCRA. Under the CCR Rule, Indiana Electric is required to complete integrity assessments and groundwater monitoring studies. In January 2018, Indiana Electric completed its first annual groundwater monitoring and corrective action report. This report identified localized impacts to groundwater near Indiana Electric’s coal impoundments. Further analysis is ongoing. In October 2018, Indiana Electric completed the CCR Rule’s required evaluation of the placement of Indiana Electric’s coal ash ponds relative to the uppermost aquifer. This evaluation indicated that Indiana Electric must cease placing materials into the ash ponds by October 31, 2020 and initiate closure of the ponds thereafter. However, the October 2020 closure deadline, which resulted from a July 2018 amendment to the CCR Rule, is being challenged in the D.C. Circuit. Were the July 2018 amendment vacated, the deadline for Indiana Electric to cease placing materials into the ash ponds and initiate closure could revert to the original April 2019 deadline. However, the CCR Rule allows for a pond to continue receiving materials beyond the deadline for closure upon certification that there is an absence of alternative disposal capacity. Indiana Electric plans to seek such an extension that would allow it to continue to use the ponds through completion of the generation transition plans by December 31, 2023. Failure to obtain this extension may result in increased and potentially significant operational costs in connection with the accelerated implementation of an alternative ash disposal system or adversely impact Indiana Electric’s future operations. Failure to comply with these requirements could also result in an enforcement proceeding including imposition of fines and penalties. Further, a release of coal ash that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to health of the environment could result in remediation costs, civil and/or criminal penalties, claims, litigation, increased regulation and compliance costs and reputational damage, all of which could adversely affect the financial condition of Indiana Electric. The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and believes insurance capacity to be limited. Historically, Houston Electric has been able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise.  In the future, any such recovery may not be granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Our operations and Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties; •inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles and farm and utility equipment; 38•leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and •other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our or Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we or Enable operate could have a material adverse effect on our or Enable’s operations.The Registrants could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that they have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, the Registrants could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses no longer owned by them. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a predecessor of Houston Electric, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn) and Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), those companies and/or their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of the Registrants. Such indemnities have applied in various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time and cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets (further appellate review of the last remaining case involving CES, a subsidiary of CERC Corp., has been stayed pending approval of a settlement agreement following the Ninth Court of Appeals’ reversal in August 2018 of the district court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of CES). In June 2017, GenOn and various affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. CenterPoint Energy, CERC and CES submitted proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings to protect their indemnity rights. In October 2018, CES, GenOn, and the plaintiffs reached an agreement to settle all claims against CES and CES’s indemnity claims against GenOn, subject to approvals by the bankruptcy court and the federal district court. In December 2018, GenOn completed its reorganization and emerged from Chapter 11, and in January 2019, the bankruptcy court approved the settlement between CES and GenOn. If the settlement agreement between CES, GenOn and the plaintiffs is not approved by the federal district court, CES could incur liability and be responsible for satisfying it.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and CenterPoint Energy would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by CenterPoint Energy, and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits CenterPoint Energy has agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by CenterPoint Energy, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate.Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols;•the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;39•labor disputes; •information technology or financial system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, terrorism, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, which may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Our and Enable’s success depends upon our and Enable’s ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We and Enable depend on senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our and Enable’s success depends on our and Enable’s ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our and Enable’s operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our and Enable’s management team, our and Enable’s future success depends in part on our and Enable’s ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our and Enable’s strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our and Enable’s results of operations.Our and Enable’s businesses are dependent on recruiting, retaining and motivating employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our and Enable’s costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our and Enable’s businesses. If we and Enable are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our and Enable’s results of operations could be negatively affected. Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our or Enable’s services.Regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting new legislation and/or modifying existing laws and regulations, to reduce GHGs, and there continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation.  Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues.Due to the electric generating facilities acquired in the Merger, CenterPoint Energy is subject to the requirements of the CPP, which requires a 32% reduction in carbon emissions from 2005 levels. While implementation of the CPP remains uncertain due to the February 2016 U.S. Supreme Court stay delaying implementation during court challenges and an October 2017 proposed rule from the EPA which, if finalized, would result in the CPP’s repeal, as written the CPP may substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of CenterPoint Energy’s fossil fuel generating plants and NGD business. In August 2018, the EPA proposed a CPP replacement rule, the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, which, if finalized could similarly impact the costs of CenterPoint Energy’s fossil fuel generating plants. In addition to regulatory risk, we may be subject to climate change lawsuits which could result in substantial penalties or damages. Moreover, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels may have substantial impacts on CenterPoint Energy’s electric generation and NGD businesses. 40Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements. These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, NGD’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas. Further, Indiana Electric’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for their operations. Additionally, Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses’ revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could adversely impact financial results from our and Enable’s businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.A changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes, both physical and financial in nature, to our service territories. If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our and Enable’s businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes or ice storms.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Decreased energy use may also require us to retire current infrastructure that is no longer needed. We are uncertain how state commissions and local municipalities may require us to respond to the effects of the TCJA, and these regulatory requirements may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the TCJA, which resulted in significant changes to federal tax laws effective January 1, 2018, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate.For Houston Electric, Indiana Electric and NGD, federal income tax expense is included in the rates approved by state commissions and local municipalities and charged by those utilities to consumers.  When Houston Electric, Indiana Electric and NGD have general rate cases and other periodic rate adjustments, we expect the lower corporate tax expense resulting from the TCJA (which includes determining the treatment of EDIT), along with other increases and decreases in our revenue requirements, to be incorporated into Houston Electric’s, Indiana Electric’s and NGD’s future rates.  Nevertheless, regulators may require us to respond to the TCJA in other ways, including through faster recoveries of reductions in federal income tax expense, accounting orders to reflect a liability to return to customers in future rate proceedings, accelerated returns to consumers of previously collected deferred federal income taxes, increased funding of infrastructure upgrades, or offsets of future rate increases.  The effect on us of any potential return of tax savings resulting from the TCJA to consumers may differ depending on how each regulatory body requires us to return such savings. We can provide no assurances on how any regulatory body will ultimately require us to act.  As such, we are currently unable to determine the impact of these potential regulatory actions in response to the enactment of the TCJA, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For further information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.In addition, the TCJA also includes a variety of other changes, such as a limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense and acceleration of business asset expensing, among others. Several provisions of the TCJA are not generally applicable to the public utility industry, including the limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense and the acceleration of business asset expensing. We continue to assess the impact that the TCJA may have on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which impact may adversely affect our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.41NGD and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs. Certain of NGD’s and Enable’s pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations. The DOT’s PHMSA has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures, for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require pipeline operators, including NGD and Enable, to, among other things:•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;•develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; •identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area; •improve data collection, integration, and analysis;•develop processes for performance management, record keeping, management of change and communication; •repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and •implement preventive and mitigating action. Failure to comply with PHMSA or analogous state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences that may have an adverse effect on NGD’s and Enable’s operations. Both NGD and Enable incur significant costs associated with their compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations, which may not be recoverable in rates.Changes to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on NGD and Enable. Changes to pipeline safety regulations occur frequently. For example, PHMSA is expected to publish finalized regulations in 2019, for both natural gas and hazardous liquids pipelines, that will significantly extend and expand the reach of certain PHMSA integrity management requirements (e.g., period assessments, leak detection and repairs) regardless of proximity to a high consequence area. The final rules may also impose new requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including gathering lines. The adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require us and Enable to incur increased and potentially significant operational costs.Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets. The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement, or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. Further, with respect to NGD’s operations, if certain pipeline replacements (for example, cast-iron or bare steel pipe) are not completed timely or successfully, government agencies and private parties might allege the uncompleted replacements caused events such as fires, explosions or leaks. Although we maintain insurance for certain of our facilities, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient in the event that a catastrophic loss is alleged to have been caused by a failure to timely complete equipment replacements. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. We have several separate bargaining units, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement described below: •The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 66 related to employees of Houston Electric is scheduled to expire in May 2020;  •The collective bargaining agreements with USW Locals 13-227 and 13-1 related to NGD’s employees in Texas are scheduled to expire in June 2022 and July 2022, respectively; 42•The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union Local 340, IBEW Local 949 and OPEIU Local 12 and Mankato related to NGD employees in Minnesota are scheduled to expire in April 2020, December 2020, May 2021 and March 2021, respectively; •The collective bargaining agreements with IBEW Local 1393, USW Locals 12213 and 7441 related to employees of NGD in Indiana are scheduled to expire in December 2020; •The collective bargaining agreements with the Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers Union Local 135 and Utility Workers Union Local 175 related to employees of Indiana Electric were recently renegotiated and are scheduled to expire in September 2021 and October 2021, respectively; and  •The collective bargaining agreement with IBEW Local 702 related to employees of Indiana Electric was scheduled to expire in June 2019 but was renegotiated in January 2019 with the ratification of a new three-year labor agreement.Additionally, Infrastructure Services negotiates various trade agreements through contractor associations.  The two primary associations are the DCA and the PLCA.  These trade agreements are with a variety of construction unions including Laborer’s International Union of North America, International Union of Operating Engineers, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry, and Teamsters.  The trade agreements have varying expiration dates in 2020, 2021 and 2022. In addition, these subsidiaries have various project agreements and small local agreements.  These agreements expire upon completion of a specific project or on various dates throughout the year.Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change. We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods for energy production and delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar, microturbines, fuel cells), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce consumption. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services. Further, certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our or Enable’s potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected.From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings.  However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our and Enable’s future growth may be adversely affected.43Any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt our or Enable’s ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.    We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcomes of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.The Registrants are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 16 to the Registrants’ respective consolidated financial statements. With respect to the Merger, in July 2018, seven separate lawsuits were filed against Vectren and the individual directors of Vectren’s Board of Directors in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. These lawsuits allege violations of Sections 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9 on the grounds that the Proxy Statement filed on June 18, 2018 was materially incomplete because it omitted material information concerning the Merger. The lawsuits also seek certification as class actions.  In August 2018, the seven lawsuits were consolidated, and the Court denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs filed their Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint on October 29, 2018, which Defendants have moved to dismiss and which motion remains pending. On December 28, 2018, two plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their lawsuits. The defendants believe that the allegations asserted are without merit and intend to vigorously defend themselves against the claims raised.Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the Registrants cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on the Registrants’ financial results. We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors including unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although Houston Electric’s and Indiana Electric’s transmission and distribution businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.44For example, Houston Electric’s business is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. Although Houston, Texas has a diverse economy, employment in the energy industry remains important with overall Houston employment growing at a moderate rate in 2018. Further, the operations of Vectren’s utility businesses are concentrated in central and southern Indiana and west-central Ohio and are therefore impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest.  These industries include automotive assembly, parts and accessories; feed, flour and grain processing; metal castings, plastic products; gypsum products; electrical equipment, metal specialties, glass and steel finishing; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining. In the event economic conditions further decline, the respective rates of growth in Houston, Indiana and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate. Changing market conditions, including changing regulation, changes in market prices of oil or other commodities, or changes in government regulation and assistance, may cause certain industrial customers to reduce or cease production and thereby decrease consumption of natural gas and/or electricity. Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition. Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows"
14,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2018-02-22,"Risk Factors
 We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric and CERC. We also own interests in Enable. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with our holding company, the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in Enable. However, additional risks and uncertainties either not presently known or not currently believed by management to be material may also adversely affect our businesses.Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionWe are a holding company with no operations or operating assets of our own. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.We derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries, including our interests in Enable. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. In general, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ and Enable’s ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries or Enable could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.  For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in Enable, please read “ — Additional Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect” and “ — Other Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses or Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — Our or Enable’s potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected.” Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive. We depend (i) on long-term debt to finance a portion of our capital expenditures and refinance our existing debt, (ii) on short-term borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs and (iii) on distributions from our interests in Enable to satisfy liquidity needs to the extent not satisfied by cash flow from our business operations; we may also depend on the net proceeds from a potential sale of common units we own in Enable. As of December 31, 2017, we had $8.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $1.9 billion of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $50 million principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2020. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $1.1 billion on Securitization Bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enable’s units or volatility in Enable’s unit price;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;17•our exposure to GenOn (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy and RRI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG and currently the subject of bankruptcy proceedings, in connection with certain indemnification obligations;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2017, Houston Electric had approximately $2.9 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including approximately $118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, Houston Electric had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $4.2 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2017. However, Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity and cost method investments could reduce our earnings. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired.  Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For investments we account for under the equity or cost method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, if Enable’s unit price, distributions or earnings were to decline, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in Enable. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in our recording impairment charges in the future. Should our annual impairment test or another periodic impairment test, as described above, indicate the fair value of our assets is less than the carrying value, we would be required to take a non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. A non-cash impairment charge could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Increased utilization due to changing demographics, poor investment performance of the pension plan and other factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position.We maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and we may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting our funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position. 18The costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees may increase substantially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We provide health care benefits to eligible employees and retirees through self-insured plans. In recent years, the costs of providing these benefits have risen due to increasing health care costs and increased levels of large individual health care claims and overall health care claims, and we anticipate that such costs will continue to rise. Further, the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our health care benefit programs and costs. Any potential changes and resulting cost impacts, which are likely to be passed on to us, cannot be determined with certainty at this time. Our costs of providing these benefits could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us, our subsidiaries or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or Enable.We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risks. We, including our subsidiaries, or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. Additionally, in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.If we redeem the ZENS prior to their maturity in 2029, our ultimate tax liability and redemption payments would result in significant cash payments, which would adversely impact our cash flows. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact our cash flows.We have approximately $828 million principal amount of ZENS outstanding as of December 31, 2017. We own shares of TW Securities equal to approximately 100% of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the ZENS. We may redeem all of the ZENS at any time at a redemption amount per ZENS equal to the higher of the contingent principal amount per ZENS ($505 million in the aggregate, or $35.54 per ZENS, as of December 31, 2017) or the sum of the current market value of the reference shares attributable to one ZENS at the time of redemption.  In the event we redeem the ZENS, in addition to the redemption amount, we would be required to pay deferred taxes related to the ZENS.  Our ultimate tax liability related to the ZENS continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year. If the ZENS had been redeemed on December 31, 2017, deferred taxes of approximately $521 million would have been payable by us in 2017, based on 2017 tax rates in effect. In addition, if all the shares of TW Securities had been sold on December 31, 2017 in order to fund the aggregate redemption amount, capital gains taxes of approximately $297 million would have been payable by us in 2017, based on 2017 tax rates in effect. Similarly, a significant amount of exchanges of ZENS by ZENS holders could adversely impact our cash flows. This could happen if our creditworthiness were to drop or the market for the ZENS were to become illiquid, or for some other reason. While funds for the payment of cash upon exchange of ZENS could be obtained from the sale of the shares of TW Securities that we own or from other sources, ZENS exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the ZENS and TW Securities shares would typically cease when ZENS are exchanged and TW Securities shares are sold. Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution BusinessRate regulation of Houston Electric’s business may delay or deny Houston Electric’s ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs.Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT based on an analysis of its invested capital, its expenses and other factors in a test year in comprehensive base rate proceedings (i.e., general rate cases) subject to periodic review and adjustment. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s control. The rates that Houston Electric is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, which is referred to as “regulatory lag.”Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, these adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For example, the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utility’s rates for increases in net distribution-invested capital (e.g., distribution plant and intangible plant and communication equipment) since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding, but Houston Electric may only make a DCRF filing once per calendar year. The TCOS 19mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital, but is only available twice per calendar year.Houston Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates. Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s costs or enable Houston Electric to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services.Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months. Unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. Conversely, extreme warm weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.Houston Electric could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the Texas RE, a Texas non-profit corporation. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.  In addition, if Houston Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.A substantial portion of Houston Electric’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in such payments could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2017, Houston Electric did business with approximately 68 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., formerly known as TCEH Corp. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2017 was $215 million Approximately 34% and 12% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Vistra Energy Corp., respectively.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP.  20The AMS deployed throughout Houston Electric’s service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data.Houston Electric has deployed an AMS throughout its service territory, which integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers’ premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer’s change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service.  Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of Houston Electric, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse effect on Houston Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services BusinessesRate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn an expected return and fully recover its costs.CERC’s rates for NGD are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions based on an analysis of NGD’s invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic) in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment. Each of these proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of CERC’s control. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.”Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce NGD’s ability to adjust its rates.Arkansas allows public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP, providing for a utility’s base rates to be adjusted once a year. In each of Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions. Additionally, in Minnesota, the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling pilot program, which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers. The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body.In Texas, NGD’s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year. NGD must file a general rate case no later than five years after the initial GRIP implementation date.NGD can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of NGD’s costs or enable NGD to earn an expected return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact NGD’s ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGD’s cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Access to natural gas supplies and pipeline transmission and storage capacity are essential components of reliable service for CERC’s customers. CERC depends on third-party service providers to maintain an adequate supply of natural gas and for available storage and intrastate and interstate pipeline capacity to satisfy NGD’s customers’ needs, all of which are critical to system reliability. CERC purchases substantially all of NGD’s natural gas supply from intrastate and interstate pipelines. If CERC is unable to secure an independent natural gas supply of its own or through its affiliates or if third-party service providers fail to timely deliver natural gas to meet NGD’s requirements, the resulting decrease in CERC’s natural gas supply in its service territories could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Additionally, a significant disruption, whether through reduced intrastate and interstate pipeline transmission or storage capacity or other events affecting natural gas supply, including, but not limited to, operational failures, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, acts of terrorism or cyber-attacks or changes in legislative 21or regulatory requirements, could also adversely affect CERC’s business. Further, to the extent that CERC’s natural gas requirements cannot be met through access to or continued use of existing natural gas infrastructure or if additional infrastructure, including onshore and offshore exploration and production facilities, gathering and processing systems and pipeline and storage capacity is not constructed at a rate that satisfies demand, then CERC’s NGD growth could be negatively affected.          CERC’s NGD and Energy Services business, including transportation and storage, whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements, are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials that impact our business, including transportation and storage, whether through the use of AMAs or other arrangements. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which CERC operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements. AMAs may be subject to regulatory approval, and such agreements may not be renewed or may be renewed with less favorable terms.A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas, which consequently would increase its cash requirements and adversely affect its financial condition.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.  Unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The states in which CERC provides regulated local natural gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.From time to time, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas and have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end users. In 22addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP  We hold a substantial limited partner interest in Enable (54.1% of the outstanding common units representing limited partner interests in Enable as of December 31, 2017), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner. As of December 31, 2017, we owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Series A Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in Enable.  Accordingly, our future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable and the value of our interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of our interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors
” that are applicable to Enable.Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.Both CERC Corp. and OGE hold their limited partner interests in Enable in the form of common units. We also hold Series A Preferred Units in Enable.  For its Series A Preferred Units, Enable is expected to pay $0.625 per Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.50 per Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis. However, distributions on each Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are non-cumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Series A Preferred Units. Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding common units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”). Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it (i) to pay distributions on the Series A Preferred Units or (ii) maintain or increase the distributions on its common units. Additionally, distributions on the Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common units. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common units and Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;•the level of competition from other companies offering midstream services;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:•the level and timing of its capital expenditures;•the cost of acquisitions;•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;23•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner; •distributions paid on its Series A Preferred Units; •any impact on cash levels should any sale of our investment in Enable occur; and•other business risks affecting its cash levels. The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to us on its common units and Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common units and Series A Preferred Units, depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.Enable’s Series A Preferred Units are required to be redeemed in certain circumstances if they are not eligible for trading on the NYSE, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem its Series A Preferred Units if required to do so.As a holder of Enable’s Series A Preferred Units, we may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE. If Enable is unable to list the Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.We are not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.Enable is controlled jointly by CERC Corp. and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of Enable.  The board of directors of Enable’s general partner is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by us, the president and chief executive officer of Enable’s general partner and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE.  Accordingly, we are not able to exercise control over Enable.Although we jointly control Enable with OGE, we may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.CERC Corp. and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner, as well as limited partner interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  We also hold Series A Preferred Units in Enable.  Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Enable and its unitholders. Our joint control of the general partner of Enable may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary or contractual duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable. In resolving these conflicts, we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement. These circumstances could subject us to claims that, in favoring our own interests and those of our affiliates, we breached a fiduciary or contractual duty to Enable or its unitholders.Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks.As contracts with its existing suppliers and customers expire, Enable negotiates extensions or renewals of those contracts or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. Enable may be unable to extend or renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. Depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of an extension or renewal, gathering and processing customers with fee based contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements and gathering and processing customers with contracts that contain minimum volume commitments may desire to 24enter into contracts without minimum volume commitments. Likewise, Enable’s transportation and storage customers may choose not to extend or renew expiring contracts based on the economics of the related areas of production. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing revenues and its transportation and storage revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation and storage services and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.For the year ended December 31, 2017, 57% of Enable’s gathered natural gas volumes were attributable to the affiliates of Continental, Vine, GeoSouthern, XTO Energy and Tapstone Energy and 51% of its transportation and storage service revenues were attributable to our affiliates or affiliates of Spire, American Electric Power Company, OGE and Continental. The loss of all or even a portion of the gathering and processing or transportation and storage services for any of these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others.Enable’s businesses are dependent on the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil. Enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, or the amount of natural gas, NGL or crude oil reserves associated with wells connected to its systems. In addition, as the rate at which production from wells currently connected to its systems naturally declines over time, Enable’s gross margin associated with those wells will also decline. To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, Enable’s customers must continually obtain new natural gas, NGL and crude oil supplies. The primary factors affecting Enable’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near its systems, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its capacity as needed. If Enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing, transportation and storage facilities would decline, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:•the availability and cost of capital; •prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil; •levels of reserves; •geological considerations; •environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and •the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Enable’s control. Because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Declines in natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity. Sustained low natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.25In addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems and in its processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time. Enable’s industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Enable’s competitors include large energy companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil than Enable. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services Enable provides to its customers. Excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by Enable’s interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact Enable’s ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire. In addition, Enable’s customers that are significant producers of natural gas or crude oil may develop their own gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems in lieu of using Enable’s systems. Enable’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. Further, natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end users, including electricity, coal and liquid fuels. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage services. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.Enable’s business plan calls for investment in capital improvements and additions. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately $450 million to $600 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately $95 million to $125 million for the year ending December 31, 2018. The construction of additions or modifications to Enable’s existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond Enable’s control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed its estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating, processing, compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs and availability of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. Moreover, Enable’s revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if Enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. In addition, Enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve Enable’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.In connection with Enable’s capital investments, Enable may estimate, or engage a third party to estimate, potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate either in volume or timing due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. To the extent estimates of the volume of new production are inaccurate, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. To the extent estimates in the timing of new production are inaccurate, new facilities may be constructed in advance of the actual need for capacity or may not be constructed in time to accommodate volume flows, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing 26gathering lines may be unavailable and Enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse changes in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond Enable’s control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.  Enable’s natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. In 2017, 7%, 35% and 58% of Enable’s processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. If the price at which Enable sells natural gas or NGLs is less than the cost at which Enable purchases natural gas or NGLs under these arrangements, then Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected. At any given time, Enable’s overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that Enable is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that Enable is a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Some of Enable’s customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness. Severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit Enable’s ability to collect amounts owed to it, or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. In addition, many of Enable’s customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers’ liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to Enable. Furthermore, some of Enable’s customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to Enable. Financial problems experienced by Enable’s customers could result in the impairment of its assets, reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of its products and services, which could reduce Enable’s revenues.Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts.Enable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 44% of Enable’s aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity on EGT and MRT and 44% of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity on EGT and MRT, was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts.  These contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC. Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between “recourse rates” (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current FERC policies. If Enable’s costs increase and it is not able to recover any shortfall of revenue associated with its negotiated rate contracts, the cash flow realized by Enable’s systems could decrease and, therefore, the cash Enable has available for distribution could also decrease.27If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable depends upon third-party pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its natural gas transportation systems and upon third-party pipelines to take crude oil from its crude oil gathering systems. Enable also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of Enable’s processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. For example, an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enable’s processing plants and gathering systems, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of natural gas Enable gathers and NGLs it is able to produce. Additionally, Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities. Since Enable does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within its control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines for a specific period of time on lands owned by governmental agencies, American Indian tribes, or other third parties, including on American Indian allotments, title to which is held in trust by the United States. A loss of these rights, through Enable’s inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Spectra Energy Partners, LP, DCP Midstream, LP, Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside Enable’s control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, Enable’s business may be adversely affected.Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:•Enable’s joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;•Enable’s joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations, leaving Enable liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;•Enable may be unable to control the amount of cash it will receive from the joint venture;•Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners;•Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;•Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;•Enable’s joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and•disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.28The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.Under certain circumstances, Spectra Energy Partners, LP could have the right to purchase Enable’s ownership interest in SESH at fair market value.Enable owns a 50% ownership interest in SESH. The remaining 50% ownership interest is held by Spectra Energy Partners, LP. We own 54.1% of Enable’s common units, 100% of its Series A Preferred Units and a 40% economic interest in Enable’s general partner. Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of SESH, as amended, if, at any time, we  have a right to receive less than 50% of Enable’s distributions through our interests in Enable and its general partner, or do not have the ability to exercise certain control rights, Spectra Energy Partners, LP could have the right to purchase Enable’s interest in SESH at fair market value, subject to certain exceptions.Enable’s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources.Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally, Enable’s cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.Enable depends on access to the capital markets to fund its expansion capital expenditures. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable’s common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.As of December 31, 2017, Enable had approximately $2.6 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums on their senior notes, $405 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $450 million outstanding under its unsecured term loan agreement dated July 31, 2015. Enable has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, of which $1.3 billion was available as of February 1, 2018. Enable has the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;29•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;•dispose of assets;•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and•change the nature of its business.Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.Enable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business.Performance of Enable’s operations requires that Enable obtain and maintain a number of federal and state permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable’s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could adversely affect Enable’s ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Additionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public and Indian lands. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations.30Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, delay or increase its costs of construction, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. For instance, in May 2016, the EPA issued final New Source Performance Standards governing methane emissions imposing more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing, storage, and transmission facilities. These rules have required changes to Enable’s operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. Additionally, several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations. Future federal and state regulations relating to Enable’s gathering and processing, transmission, and storage operations remain a possibility and could result in increased compliance costs on its operations. Furthermore, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where its oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which could adversely affect demand for Enable’s services to those customers.There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Enable’s operations due to its handling of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and produced water, as well as air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. These matters are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants, wildlife, and natural and cultural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact Enable’s business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on, under or from Enable’s properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under its control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which Enable’s gathering and transportation systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of Enable’s pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact Enable’s customers’ production and operations, resulting in less demand for its services.Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and waste water injection wells could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Hydraulic fracturing is common practice that is used by many of Enable’s customers to stimulate production of natural gas and crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. In past sessions, Congress has considered, but not passed, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The EPA has issued the Safe Water Drinking Act permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority. Some states have adopted, and other states have considered adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enable’s oil and natural gas exploration 31and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enable’s services to those customers.State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In March 2017, the United States Geological Survey produced an updated seismic hazard survey that forecasted lower earthquake rates in regions of induced activity, but still showed significantly elevated hazards in the central and eastern United States. In light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. For example, the OCC has implemented volume reduction plans, and at times required shut-ins, for disposal wells injecting wastewater from oil and gas operations into the Arbuckle formation. In December 2016, the OCC also released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province and the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity. Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Enable cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for Enable’s customers, which in turn could reduce the demand for Enable’s services.Other governmental agencies, including the DOE, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural gas transportation services and crude oil gathering services. The relevant states in which Enable operates include North Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Illinois.The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer. If Enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit its profitability. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent Enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so. The regulatory agencies that regulate Enable’s systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for Enable’s services or otherwise adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.  Further, should Enable fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, but FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and 32natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure you that the FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. Although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of Enable’s facilities it considers to be gathering facilities, Enable believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of Enable’s gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA or the NGPA. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect Enable’s financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, if any of Enable’s facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the FERC.Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enable’s gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.Other Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses or Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:•restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas.To comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations;•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•clean or decommission waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners 33and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive and believes insurance capacity to be limited. In the future, Houston Electric may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our operations and Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties; •inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment; •leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and •other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of our or Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which we or Enable operate could have a material adverse effect on our or Enable’s operations. Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. We, Houston Electric and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, we, Houston Electric and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, Houston Electric and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a predecessor of Houston Electric, directly or through subsidiaries and include:34•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn) and Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), those companies and/or their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of CenterPoint Energy entities. Such indemnities have applied in cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets (the last remaining case involving us is now on appeal, following the district court’s summary judgment in favor of CES, a subsidiary of CERC Corp.) and various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time. In June 2017, GenOn and various affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In December 2017, GenOn received court approval of a restructuring plan and is expected to emerge from Chapter 11 in mid-2018. We, CERC and CES submitted proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings to protect our indemnity rights. If any of the indemnifying entities were unable to meet their indemnity obligations or satisfy a liability that has been assumed in the gas market manipulation litigation, we, Houston Electric or CERC could incur liability and be responsible for satisfying the liability. In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us, and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate.Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enable’s reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, network infrastructure, technology and facilities used to conduct almost all of our and Enable’s business which includes (i) managing operations and other business processes and (ii) protecting sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. For example, the operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our system. This reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of smart meters and the intelligent grid.  Similarly, our and Enable’s business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enable’s pipeline facilities and third-party systems. The gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enable’s facilities. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural disasters, by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets.Cyber-attacks and unauthorized access could also result in the loss, or unauthorized use, of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyber-attacks and unauthorized access. Neither we nor Enable is fully insured against all cyber-security risks, any of which could adversely affect our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.In addition, our and Enable’s critical energy infrastructure may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our respective business operations. In January 2017, the DOE’s Quadrennial Energy Review reported that cyber threats to the electricity system are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 35Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information (e.g., information of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and employees), and there is an expectation that we will adequately protect that information. The U.S. regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of the personally identifiable information we maintain, or of our data, by cyber-crime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes, including failure to follow appropriate safety protocols;•the handling of hazardous equipment or materials that could result in serious personal injury, loss of life and environmental and property damage;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •information technology or financial system failures, including those due to the implementation and integration of new technology, that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, terrorism, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences, which may require participation in mutual assistance efforts by us or other utilities to assist in power restoration efforts.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition, motivate and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations.Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.36Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our or Enable’s services.Regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting legislation, including modification of existing laws and regulations, to reduce GHGs, and there continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation.  Efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements. These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Nevertheless, Houston Electric’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could adversely impact financial results from our and Enable’s businesses and result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.If climate changes occur that result in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our and Enable’s businesses could be adversely impacted. For example, CERC’s NGD could be adversely affected through lower natural gas sales and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted.We are uncertain how state commissions and local municipalities may require us to respond to the effects of the recent comprehensive tax reform legislation, and these regulatory requirements may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law comprehensive tax reform legislation informally called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, which resulted in significant changes to federal tax laws effective January 1, 2018, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the corporate income tax rate.For Houston Electric and NGD, federal income tax expense is included in the rates approved by state commissions and local municipalities and charged by those utilities to consumers.  When Houston Electric and NGD have general rate cases and other periodic rate adjustments, we expect the lower corporate tax expense resulting from the TCJA (which includes determining the treatment of EDIT), along with other increases and decreases in our revenue requirements, to be incorporated into Houston Electric’s and NGD’s future rates.  Nevertheless, regulators may require us to respond to the TCJA in other ways, including through faster recoveries of reductions in federal income tax expense, accounting orders to reflect a liability to return to customers in future rate proceedings, accelerated returns to consumers of previously collected deferred federal income taxes, increased funding of infrastructure upgrades, or offsets of future rate increases.  The effect on us of any potential return of tax savings resulting from the TCJA to consumers may differ depending on how each regulatory body requires us to return such savings.On January 25, 2018, the PUCT issued an accounting order in Project No. 47945 directing electric utilities, including Houston Electric, to record as a regulatory liability (1) the difference between revenues collected under existing rates and revenues that would have been collected had the existing rates been set using the recently approved federal income tax rates and (2) the balance of EDIT that now exists because of the reduction in federal income tax rates. On February 13, 2018, Houston Electric and other 37likely parties to a future rate case announced a settlement that requires Houston Electric to make (i) a TCOS filing by February 20, 2018 to reflect the change in the federal income tax rate for Houston Electric’s transmission rate base through July 31, 2017 and account for certain EDIT (and such filing was timely submitted), (ii) a DCRF filing in April 2018 to reflect the change in the federal income tax rate for Houston Electric’s distribution rate base through December 31, 2017 and (iii) a full rate case filing by April 30, 2019. The settlement was presented to the PUCT during its open meeting on February 15, 2018. In response to the settlement, the PUCT did not proceed with a prior proposal to require Houston Electric to file a rate case in the summer of 2018. The PUCT also amended its prior accounting order to remove the requirement that utilities include carrying costs in the new regulatory liability. We can provide no assurances on how any regulatory body will ultimately require us to act.  As such, we are currently unable to determine the impact of these potential regulatory actions in response to the enactment of the TCJA, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In addition, the TCJA also includes a variety of other changes, such as a limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense and acceleration of business asset expensing, among others. Several provisions of the TCJA are not generally applicable to the public utility industry, including the limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense and the acceleration of business asset expensing.  We continue to assess the impact that the TCJA may have on our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which impact may adversely affect our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.Certain of CERC’s and Enable’s pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations. The DOT’s PHMSA has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures, for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require pipeline operators, including CERC and Enable, to, among other things:•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;•develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; •identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area; •improve data collection, integration, and analysis;•develop processes for performance management, record keeping, management of change and communication; •repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and •implement preventive and mitigating action. Failure to comply with PHMSA or comparable state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences that may have an adverse effect on CERC’s and Enable’s operations. Both CERC and Enable incur significant costs associated with their compliance with existing PHMSA and comparable state regulations, which may not be recoverable in rates. Changes to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on CERC and Enable. For example, in January 2017, PHMSA announced the issuance of the Pipeline Safety: Safety of Hazardous Liquids Pipelines final rule.  The final rule extends regulatory reporting requirements to additional liquid gathering lines, requires additional event-driven and periodic inspections, requires use of leak detection systems on additional hazardous liquid pipelines, modifies repair criteria, and requires certain pipelines to eventually accommodate inline inspection tools.  It is unclear when or if this rule will go into effect as, on January 20, 2017, the Trump Administration requested that all regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register, but not yet published, be immediately withdrawn for further review, which is currently in progress. These proposals, if finalized, would impose additional costs on CERC and Enable.In March 2016, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking detailing proposed revisions to the safety standards applicable to natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The proposed rules include significant modifications which, if adopted, will result in significant operational and integrity management changes.  These include requiring reconfirmation of the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressures in pipelines without reliable records, creating new material verification procedures, adding a new 38moderate consequence area, and tightening repair criteria for pipelines in both high and moderate consequence areas. Other modifications include adding record-keeping and data collection obligations, and new requirements for monitoring gas quality and managing corrosion.  The proposed rules also would expand the scope of gas gathering lines subject to PHMSA regulation, including imposing minimum safety standards on certain larger, currently exempt, gathering lines, while subjecting all gathering-line operators to recordkeeping and annual reporting requirements from which they are currently exempt. Other proposed changes, such as the modification to the definition of a transmission line, some record-keeping requirements, and some material verification obligations also may impact distribution pipelines although PHMSA states that such far-reaching applicability is not its intent. This rule is also currently under evaluation, and PHMSA is expected to issue a final rule in the third quarter of 2018 at the earliest. Because the impact of these proposed rules remains uncertain, we are still monitoring and evaluating the effect of these proposed requirements on operations.On December 14, 2016, PHMSA announced an interim final rule to impose industry-developed recommendations as enforceable safety standards for downhole (underground) equipment, including wells, wellbore tubing, and casing, at both interstate and intrastate underground natural gas storage facilities. States may also impose more stringent standards on intrastate storage facilities. Both CERC and Enable own and operate underground storage facilities that will be subject to this rule’s provisions, which include procedures and practices for operations, maintenance, threat identification, monitoring, assessment, site security, emergency response and preparedness, training and recordkeeping. Although not yet finalized, the interim rule went into effect on January 18, 2017, with a compliance deadline of January 18, 2018. PHMSA determined, however, that it will not issue enforcement citations to any operators for violations of those provisions of the interim final rule that had previously been non-mandatory provisions of American Petroleum Institute Recommended Practices 1170 and 1171 until one year after PHMSA issues a final rule, which has not yet been issued. This matter remains ongoing and subject to future PHMSA determinations. CERC and Enable will continue to monitor developments and assess the potential impact of any modifications to this rule.Proposed rulemakings such as those discussed above could expand the scope of natural gas and hazardous liquids integrity management programs and other pipeline safety regulations to include additional requirements or previously exempt pipelines. CERC and Enable have not estimated the cost of complying with any proposed changes to the regulations administered by PHMSA or state pipeline safety regulators.Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.We have risks associated with aging infrastructure assets.  The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement, or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses.The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. There are seven separate bargaining units in CenterPoint Energy, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement. In 2017, CERC entered into renegotiated collective bargaining agreements with United Steelworkers Local 227 and United Steelworkers Local 13-1, which are scheduled to expire in June and July of 2022, respectively. The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union Local 340, IBEW Local 66 and Local 949 are each scheduled to expire in 2020, and the collective bargaining agreements with Professional Employees International Union Local 12 are scheduled to expire in 2021. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change.We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly and increasing in complexity. New technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods of energy delivery. Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., private solar), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce consumption. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option 39over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services.Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, or if implemented technology does not operate as anticipated, our businesses, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Our or Enable’s potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected.From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings.  However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our and Enable’s future growth may be adversely affected.Any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.    In February 2016, we announced that we were evaluating strategic alternatives for our investment in Enable, including a sale or spin-off qualifying under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that we will no longer pursue a spin option at this time. More recently, we announced that late-stage discussions with a third party regarding a transaction involving our investment in Enable had terminated because an agreement on mutually acceptable terms could not be reached. We may reduce our ownership in Enable over time through sales in the public equity markets, or otherwise, of the common units we hold, subject to market conditions. Although a transaction for all our interests in Enable is not viable at this time, we may pursue such a transaction if it is viable in the future. Our ability to execute any sale of common units is subject to a number of uncertainties, including the timing, pricing and terms of any such sale.  Any sales of our common units could have an adverse impact on the price of Enable common units or on any trading market for Enable common units. Further, our sales of Enable common units may have an adverse impact on Enable’s ability to issue equity on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand operations or make future acquisitions. Any reduction in our interest in Enable would result in decreased distributions from Enable, which may reduce our operating income and adversely impact our ability to meet our payment obligations and pay dividends on our common stock. For a further discussion, please read “— Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — Enable’s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources.” There can be no assurances that we will engage in any specific action or that any sale transaction or any sale of common units in the public equity markets or otherwise will be completed, and we do not intend to disclose further developments unless and until our board of directors approves a specific action or as otherwise required by applicable law or NYSE regulations. Any sale transaction or sale of common units in the public equity markets or otherwise may involve significant costs and expenses, including, in connection with any public offering, a significant underwriting discount.  We may not realize any or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits from any completed sale or reduction in our investment in Enable. 40We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcome of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.We are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements.  Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of all matters with assurance. Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established insurance or reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors including unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in our regulated electric service territory will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although Houston Electric is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.For example, our electric business is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country. During 2015 and 2016, the rate of growth in employment in Houston declined in connection with the significant decline in energy and commodity prices over that period. Relatively low commodity prices compared to pre-2015 levels continued in 2017, and we expect such relatively low prices to continue or slightly improve in 2018. In the event economic conditions further decline, the rate of growth in Houston and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate. Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition.Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Furthermore, we currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs. Should we be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact. If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or prevent fraud may be adversely affected. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could impact our businesses and the trading price of our securities. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls are not successful, we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting and processes in the future or we are unable to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.41Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows"
5,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2017-02-28,"Risk Factors
  We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily Houston Electric and CERC. We also own interests in Enable. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in Enable:Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionAs a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.We derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries, including our interests in Enable. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. In general, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.  For a discussion 15of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in Enable, please read “ — Additional Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.”Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.Our businesses are capital intensive in nature. We depend on long-term debt to finance a portion of our capital expenditures and refinance our existing debt and on short-term borrowings through our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs to satisfy liquidity needs to the extent not satisfied by cash flow from our business operations. As of December 31, 2016, we had $8.6 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $2.3 billion of non-recourse Securitization Bonds. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $850 million principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2019. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $1.3 billion on Securitization Bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•volatility or fluctuations in distributions from Enable’s units or volatility in Enable’s unit price;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•our exposure to GenOn (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy and RRI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG, in connection with certain indemnification obligations;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2016, Houston Electric had approximately $2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including approximately $118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, Houston Electric had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. Houston Electric may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $4.1 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2016. However, Houston Electric has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.16An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity and cost method investments could reduce our earnings. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired.  Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.For investments we account for under the equity or cost method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined that an other than temporary decrease in the value of our equity investment in Enable had occurred.  This determination was based on the sustained low Enable common unit price and further declines in such price during the year, as well as the market outlook for continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry.  We wrote down the value of our investment in Enable to its estimated fair value which resulted in impairment charges of $1,225 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Additionally, we recorded our share, $621 million, of impairment charges Enable recorded for goodwill and long-lived assets, for a total impairment charge of $1,846 million. If Enable’s unit price, distributions or earnings were to decline to levels below those used in our impairment tests in 2015, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in Enable. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment. A sustained low Enable common unit price could result in our recording further impairment charges in the future. If we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. Poor investment performance of the pension plan, factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities and increasing health care costs could unfavorably impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial position. We maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase and we may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability. In addition to affecting our funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial position. Further, increasing health care costs and the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our benefit programs and costs. Our costs of providing employee benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs, which could adversely affect our financial results. The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us, our subsidiaries or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or Enable.We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk. We, our subsidiaries or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution BusinessRate regulation of Houston Electric’s business may delay or deny Houston Electric’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs. Houston Electric’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the PUCT based on an analysis of its invested capital, its expenses and other factors in a test year in comprehensive base rate proceedings, subject to periodic review and adjustment using 17mechanisms like those discussed below. Each of these rate proceedings is subject to third-party intervention and appeal, and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of Houston Electric’s control. The rates that Houston Electric is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, which is referred to as “regulatory lag.”Though several interim adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce Houston Electric’s ability to adjust rates. For example, the DCRF mechanism adjusts an electric utility’s rates for increases in net distribution-invested capital (e.g., distribution plant and intangible plant and communication equipment) since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding, but Houston Electric may make a DCRF filing only once per year and up to four times between comprehensive rate proceedings. The TCOS mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmission-related invested capital, but is only available twice a year. Houston Electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates.  Further, the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking, as the case may be, and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of Houston Electric’s costs or enable Houston Electric to earn a reasonable return. In addition, changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact Houston Electric’s ability to recover its costs in a timely manner. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow Houston Electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services.Houston Electric transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. Houston Electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, Houston Electric’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of Houston Electric’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, Houston Electric’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months. Unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. Conversely, extreme warm weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The AMS deployed throughout Houston Electric’s service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data. Houston Electric has deployed an AMS throughout its service territory.  The deployment consisted, among other elements, of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15-minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to Houston Electric over a bi-directional communications system installed for that purpose. The AMS integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers’ premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer’s change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service.  Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of Houston Electric, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse effect on Houston Electric’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Houston Electric could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by Houston Electric and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE, a functionally independent division of ERCOT.  Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject Houston Electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.  In addition, if Houston Electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.18A substantial portion of Houston Electric’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.Houston Electric’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity Houston Electric distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2016, Houston Electric did business with approximately 64 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for Houston Electric’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. Houston Electric depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable PUCT regulations significantly limit the extent to which Houston Electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and Houston Electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. The PUCT revised its regulations in 2009 to (i) increase the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. A significant portion of Houston Electric’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings. Houston Electric’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2016 was $193 million. Approximately 33% and 12% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings, respectively.  In April 2014, Energy Future Holdings publicly disclosed that it and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, excluding Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC and its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect Houston Electric’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments Houston Electric had received from such REP.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services BusinessesRate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs. CERC’s rates for NGD are regulated by certain municipalities (in Texas only) and state commissions in the context of comprehensive base rate proceedings, i.e., general rate cases, based on an analysis of NGD’s invested capital, expenses and other factors in a test year (often either fully or partially historic), subject to periodic review and adjustment. A general rate case is also a very complex and resource intensive proceeding with a relatively long timeline for completion. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, resulting in what is referred to as “regulatory lag.” Though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by NGD to reduce the effects of regulatory lag, such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory body’s approval and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce NGD’s ability to adjust its rates. Arkansas enacted legislation in 2015 allowing public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a FRP, but such legislation provides for a utility’s base rates to be adjusted once a year.  In each of Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, NGD makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions.  Additionally, in Minnesota, the MPUC implemented a full revenue decoupling pilot program in 2015, which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers. The effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory body.In Texas, NGD’s Houston, South Texas, Beaumont/East Texas and Texas Coast divisions each submit annual GRIP filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year. NGD must file a general rate case no later than five years after the initial GRIP implementation date. NGD can make no assurances that such filings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates.  Notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above, the regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of NGD’s costs and enable NGD to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.   Additionally, inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by NGD and deny the full recovery of NGD’s cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates. To the extent the regulatory process does not allow NGD to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs, its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.19CERC’s natural gas distribution and energy services businesses, including transportation and storage, are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations and financial condition.CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which CERC operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements.A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.  Unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The states in which CERC provides regulated local natural gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.From time to time, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.20Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP We hold a substantial limited partnership interest in Enable (54.1% of Enable’s outstanding limited partnership interests as of December 31, 2016), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner. As of December 31, 2016, we owned an aggregate of 14,520,000 Series A Preferred Units in Enable. Accordingly, our future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable and the value of our interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of our interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors
” that are applicable to Enable.Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.Both CERC Corp. and OGE hold their limited partnership interests in Enable in the form of both common units and subordinated units. We also hold Series A Preferred Units in Enable.  For its Series A Preferred Units, Enable is expected to pay $0.625 per Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.50 per Series A Preferred Unit on an annualized basis. However, distributions on each Series A Preferred Unit are not mandatory and are non-cumulative in the event distributions are not declared on the Series A Preferred Units.  Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding common and subordinated units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”).  The principal difference between Enable’s common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period, holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters. If Enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units, its subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. Accordingly, if Enable is unable to pay its minimum quarterly distribution, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable may be adversely affected.  Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it to pay the minimum quarterly distribution or to pay distributions on the Series A Preferred Units.  Additionally, distributions on the Series A Preferred Units reduce the amount of available cash Enable has to pay distributions on its common and subordinated units. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its common and subordinated units and its Series A Preferred Units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;•the level of competition from other midstream energy companies;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:•the level and timing of its capital expenditures;•the cost of acquisitions;21•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner; •distributions paid on its Series A Preferred Units; and•other business risks affecting its cash levels. The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to us on its common and subordinated units and Series A Preferred Units depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its common and subordinated units and Series A Preferred Units, depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.Enable’s Series A Preferred Units are required to be redeemed in certain circumstances if they are not eligible for trading on the NYSE, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem its Series A Preferred Units if required to do so.As a holder of Enable’s Series A Preferred Units, we may request that Enable list those units for trading on the NYSE. If Enable is unable to list the Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of the Series A Preferred Units could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders.We are not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.Enable is controlled jointly by CERC Corp. and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of Enable.  The board of directors of Enable’s general partner is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by us, the president and chief executive officer of Enable’s general partner and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the NYSE.  Accordingly, we are not able to exercise control over Enable.Although we jointly control Enable with OGE, we may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.CERC Corp. and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner, as well as limited partnership interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  We also hold Series A Preferred Units in Enable.  Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Enable and its unitholders. Our joint control of the general partner of Enable may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable. In resolving these conflicts, we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement. These circumstances could subject us to claims that, in favoring our own interests and those of our affiliates, we breached a fiduciary duty to Enable or its unitholders.Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks.As contracts with its existing suppliers and customers expire, Enable may have to negotiate extensions or renewals of those contracts or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. Enable may be unable to extend or renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. Depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of an extension or renewal, gathering and processing customers with fee based contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements. Approximately 87% of Enable’s gross margin was generated from fee-based contracts during the year ended December 31, 2016. Likewise, Enable’s transportation and storage customers may choose not to extend or renew expiring contracts 22based on the economics of the related areas of production. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing services revenues and its transportation and storage services revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation and storage services and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.For the year ended December 31, 2016, 49% of Enable’s gathered natural gas volumes were attributable to the affiliates of Continental, Vine, GeoSouthern, XTO Energy and Apache and 51% of its transportation and storage service revenues were attributable to affiliates of CenterPoint Energy, Spire, XTO Energy, American Electric Power Company and OGE.The loss of all or even a portion of the gathering and processing or transportation and storage services for any of these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others.Enable’s businesses are dependent on the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil. Enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, or the amount of natural gas, NGL or crude oil reserves associated with wells connected to its systems. In addition, as the rate at which production from wells currently connected to its systems naturally declines over time, Enable’s gross margin associated with those wells will also decline. To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, Enable’s customers must continually obtain new natural gas, NGL and crude oil supplies. The primary factors affecting Enable’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near its systems, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its capacity as needed. If Enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing, transportation and storage facilities will decline, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. Enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:•the availability and cost of capital; •prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil; •levels of reserves; •geological considerations; •environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and •the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas, NGL and crude oil reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Enable’s control. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas, NGL or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Declines in natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity.  In early 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years. Both natural gas and crude oil prices increased moderately in the second half of 2016. Sustained low natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.23In addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems and processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time. In addition to capital expenditures to support growth, the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require Enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time, which will reduce its distributable cash flow.Because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Reductions in drilling activity would result in Enable’s inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Enable’s competitors include large energy companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil than Enable. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services Enable provides to its customers. Excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by Enable’s interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact Enable’s ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire. In addition, Enable’s customers that are significant producers of natural gas or crude oil may develop their own gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems in lieu of using Enable’s systems. Enable’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. Further, natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end users, including electricity, coal and liquid fuels. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and storage services. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.Enable’s business plan calls for investment in capital improvements and additions. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital could range from approximately $455 million to $575 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately $95 million to $125 million for the year ending December 31, 2017. In the second quarter of 2016, Enable delayed the completion of the Wildhorse Plant, a cryogenic processing facility that it plans to connect to its super-header system in Garvin County, Oklahoma. Enable also plans to construct natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure to support producer activity.The construction of additions or modifications to Enable’s existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond Enable’s control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed its estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating, processing, compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. Moreover, Enable’s revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if Enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. In addition, Enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve Enable’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.24In connection with Enable’s capital investments, Enable may estimate, or engage a third party to estimate, potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and Enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond Enable’s control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.  In early 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years. Both natural gas and crude oil prices increased moderately in the second half of 2016.Enable’s natural gas processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations. In 2016, 8%, 46%, and 46% of Enable’s processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. Under a typical keep-whole arrangement, Enable processes raw natural gas, extracts the NGLs, replaces the extracted NGLs with a Btu equivalent amount of natural gas, delivers the processed and replacement natural gas to the producer, retains the NGLs and sells the NGLs for its own account. If Enable is unable to sell the NGLs extracted for more than the cost of the replacement natural gas, the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected. Under a typical percent-of-proceeds processing arrangement, Enable purchases raw natural gas at a cost that is based on the amount of natural gas and NGLs contained in the raw natural gas. Enable then processes the raw natural gas, extracts the NGLs and sells the processed natural gas and NGLs for its own account. If Enable is unable to sell the processed natural gas and NGLs for more than the cost of the raw natural gas, the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected.Under a typical percent-of-liquids processing arrangement and a typical fee-based arrangement, Enable purchases a portion of the raw natural gas that is equivalent to the amount of NGLs it contains, processes the raw natural gas, extracts the NGLs, returns the processed natural gas to the producer and sells the NGLs for its own account. If Enable is unable to sell the processed natural gas and NGLs for more than the cost of raw natural gas, the margins on its sale of goods will be negatively affected.At any given time, Enable’s overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that Enable is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that Enable is a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enable’s gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its key customers could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Some of Enable’s customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness. Severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit Enable’s ability to collect amounts owed to it, or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. In addition, many of Enable’s customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers’ liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to Enable. Furthermore, some of Enable’s customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to Enable. Financial problems experienced by Enable’s customers could result in the impairment of its assets, reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of its products and services, which could reduce Enable’s revenues.25Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts.Enable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. Generally, negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the FERC, but it is possible that costs to perform services under “negotiated rate” contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by Enable’s systems and, therefore, decrease the cash it has available for distribution. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 54% of Enable’s contracted firm transportation capacity and 44% of its contracted firm storage capacity was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts.  These contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC. Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between “recourse rates” (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current FERC policies.If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable depends upon third-party pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its natural gas transportation systems and upon third-party pipelines to take crude oil from its crude oil gathering systems. Enable also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of Enable’s processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. For example, an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enable’s processing plants and gathering systems, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of natural gas Enable gathers and NGLs it is able to produce. Additionally, Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities. Since Enable does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within its control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. A loss of these rights, through Enable’s inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Spectra Energy Partners, LP, DCP Midstream Partners, LP, Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside Enable’s control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, Enable’s business may be adversely affected.Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:•Enable’s joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;•Enable’s joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations, leaving Enable liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;26•Enable may be unable to control the amount of cash it will receive from the joint venture;•Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners;•Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;•Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;•Enable’s joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and•disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.Enable’s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources.Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally, Enable’s cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.Enable depends on access to the capital markets to fund its expansion capital expenditures. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable’s common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.As of December 31, 2016, Enable had approximately $3.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums on their senior notes. Enable has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, of which $1.1 billion was available as of February 1, 2017. Enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;27•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make distributions.Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;•dispose of assets;•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and•change the nature of its business.Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.Enable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business.Performance of Enable’s operations require that Enable obtains and maintains a number of federal and state permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable’s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could adversely affect Enable’s ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Additionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public and Indian lands. 28Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations.Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, delay or increase its costs of construction, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. For instance, in May 2016, the EPA issued final New Source Performance Standards governing methane emissions imposing more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing, storage and transmission facilities. These rules have required changes to Enable’s operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. The EPA has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests to companies with production, gathering and boosting, gas processing, storage, and transmission facilities. Additionally, several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future federal and state regulations relating to Enable’s gathering and processing, transmission, and storage operations remain a possibility and could result in increased compliance costs on its operations. Furthermore, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where Enable’s oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which could adversely affect demand for Enable’s services to those customers.There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Enable’s operations due to its handling of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and produced water, as well as air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. These matters are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants, wildlife, and natural and cultural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact Enable’s business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on, under or from Enable’s properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under its control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which Enable’s gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of Enable’s pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact Enable’s customers’ production and operations, resulting in less demand for its services.Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Hydraulic fracturing is common practice that is used by many of Enable’s customers to stimulate production of natural gas and crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in May 2016, the EPA issued final new source performance standard requirements that impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity.  The EPA also released the final results of its comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water resources in December 2016. The EPA concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical 29integrity of wells. The results of EPA’s study could spur action towards federal legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations. In past sessions, Congress has considered, but not passed, legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The EPA has issued the Safe Water Drinking Act permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority. Additionally, the Bureau of Land Management issued final rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands in March 2015. Although these rules were struck down by a federal court in Wyoming in June 2016, an appeal of the decision is still pending. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enable’s oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enable’s services to those customers.State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. In light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. For example, the OCC has implemented volume reduction plans, and at times required shut-ins, for disposal wells injecting wastewater from oil and gas operations into the Arbuckle formation. The OCC also recently released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the South Central Oklahoma Oil Province and the Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity. Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Enable cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for Enable’s customers, which in turn could reduce the demand for Enable’s services.Other governmental agencies, including the DOE, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or other regulatory mechanisms.Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services. The relevant states in which Enable operates include North Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Illinois.The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer. If Enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit its profitability. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent Enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so. The regulatory agencies that regulate Enable’s systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for Enable’s services or otherwise adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.30A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, but FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure you that the FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. Although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of Enable’s facilities it considers to be gathering facilities, Enable believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of Enable’s gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA or the NGPA. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect Enable’s financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, if any of Enable’s facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the FERC.Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enable’s gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.Other Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses or Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations. Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:•restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas.To comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations;31•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•clean or decommission waste management areas, fuel storage facilities and other locations.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, Houston Electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because Houston Electric believes it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, Houston Electric may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, Houston Electric may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our operations and Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties; •inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment; •leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and •other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which Enable operates could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s operations. Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.32We, Houston Electric and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others. Under some circumstances, we, Houston Electric and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, Houston Electric and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a predecessor of Houston Electric, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn) and Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), those companies and/or their subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses transferred to them and agreed to certain indemnity agreements of CenterPoint Energy entities. Such indemnities have applied in cases such as the litigation arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets (the last remaining case involving CenterPoint Energy is now on appeal, following the district court’s summary judgment in favor of CES, a subsidiary of CERC Corp.) and various asbestos and other environmental matters that arise from time to time. GenOn has publicly disclosed that it may be unable to continue as a going concern and is exploring various options, including negotiations with creditors and lessors, refinancing, potential sale of assets, as well as the possibility of filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If any of the indemnifying entities were unable to meet their indemnity obligations or satisfy a liability that has been assumed or if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, we, Houston Electric or CERC could incur liability and be responsible for satisfying the liability. In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us, and in certain of the asbestos lawsuits we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by an NRG affiliate.Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to adversaries attacking information technology systems, network infrastructure and facilities used to (i) manage operations and other business processes and (ii) protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. The operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our system. Such reliance on information and communication between and among those components has increased since deployment of smart meters and the intelligent grid.  Similarly, our and Enable’s business operations are interconnected with external networks and facilities. The distribution of natural gas to our customers requires communications with Enable’s pipeline facilities and third-party systems. The gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities and crude oil gathering pipeline systems also rely on communications among its facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or crude oil into or receiving natural gas or crude oil and other products from Enable’s facilities. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena, by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets. Cyber-attacks and unauthorized access could also result in the loss of confidential, proprietary or critical infrastructure data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, increase costs and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability. Neither we nor Enable is fully insured against all cyber-security risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on either our, or Enable’s, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our and Enable’s critical energy infrastructure may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our respective business operations. Any such disruptions could result in significant costs to repair damaged facilities and implement increased security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.33Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us. In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the United States regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or CenterPoint Energy data by cyber-crime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •information technology or financial system failures that impair our information technology infrastructure, reporting systems or disrupt normal business operations;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, terrorism, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management.We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations.Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or Enable’s services. Regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting legislation, including modification of existing laws and regulations, to reduce GHGs, and there continues to be a wide-ranging policy and regulatory debate, both nationally and 34internationally, regarding the potential impact of GHGs and possible means for their regulation.  Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements. These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Nevertheless, Houston Electric’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses. To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and Enable’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues.  Another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted.We may be negatively impacted by changes in federal income tax policy. The Executive and Legislative Branches of the United States Federal government have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform plans, including significant changes to corporate income tax laws. We are currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws, or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on us or our regulatory activities.  It is possible that changes in the United States federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. CERC and Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs. The DOT has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require pipeline operators, including CERC and Enable, to, among other things:•perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;•develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; •identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area; •improve data collection, integration, and analysis;•develop processes  for performance management, record keeping, management of change and communication; •repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and •implement preventive and mitigating action. 35Recent regulatory proposals from PHMSA would expand the scope of its safety, reporting and recordkeeping requirements for both natural gas and hazardous liquids (including crude oil and NGLs) pipelines, as well as underground natural gas storage facilities.  These proposals, if finalized, would impose additional costs on us and Enable.In March 2016, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking detailing proposed revisions to the safety standards applicable to natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The proposed rules include significant modifications which, if adopted, will result in significant operational and integrity management changes.  These include requiring reconfirmation of the Maximum Allowable Operating Pressures in pipelines without reliable records, creating new material verification procedures, adding a new moderate consequence area, and tightening repair criteria for pipelines in both high and moderate consequence areas.  Other modifications include adding record-keeping and data collection obligations, and new requirements for monitoring gas quality and managing corrosion.  The proposed rules also would expand the scope of gas gathering lines subject to PHMSA regulation, including imposing minimum safety standards on certain larger, currently exempt, gathering lines, while subjecting all gathering-line operators to recordkeeping and annual reporting requirements from which they are currently exempt.  Other proposed changes, such as the modification to the definition of a transmission line, some record-keeping requirements, and some material verification obligations also may impact distribution pipelines although PHMSA states that such far-reaching applicability is not its intent. PHMSA is currently reviewing thousands of public comments submitted in July 2016. Because the impact of these proposed rules remains uncertain, we are still monitoring and evaluating the effect of these proposed requirements on operations.PHMSA also issued a similar notice of proposed rulemaking for hazardous liquid pipelines in October 2015. Both of these notices of proposed rulemaking would require inspections of pipeline areas affected by severe weather, natural disasters or similar events. In addition, the proposed hazardous liquid rule would extend PHMSA reporting requirements to all gathering lines, require periodic inline inspections of pipelines outside of high consequence areas, require use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modify applicable repair criteria and set a timeline for pipelines subject to integrity management requirements to be capable of accommodating inline inspection tools.  PHMSA issued the final rule for hazardous liquid pipelines on January 13, 2017, but the rule’s eventual implementation and effectiveness are uncertain as a result of a January 20, 2017 regulatory freeze.  We will continue to monitor the status of this rulemaking and the effect of these proposed requirements on operations.On December 14, 2016, PHMSA announced an interim final rule to impose industry-developed recommendations as enforceable safety standards for downhole (underground) equipment, including wells, wellbore tubing, and casing, at both interstate and intrastate underground natural gas storage facilities. This rule went into effect on January 18, 2017, with a compliance deadline of January 18, 2018. Both CERC and Enable own and operate underground storage facilities that will be subject to this rule’s provisions, which include procedures and practices for operations, maintenance, threat identification, monitoring, assessment, site security, emergency response and preparedness, training and recordkeeping. States may also impose more stringent standards on intrastate storage facilities. CERC and Enable continue to assess the potential impact of this newly announced rule.Although many of CERC’s and Enable’s pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to the requirements in PHMSA’s recent proposals, they may nonetheless incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, prevention or mitigation measures associated with their non-exempt pipelines, which are subject to existing requirements.  Work associated with PHMSA requirements is part of CERC’s and Enable’s normal integrity management program and neither expect to incur any extraordinary costs during 2017 to complete the testing required by existing DOT regulations and their state counterparts. CERC and Enable have not estimated the costs for any repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, which could be substantial, or any lost cash flows resulting from shutting down their pipelines during the pendency of such repairs. Should CERC or Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations, they could be subject to penalties and fines. Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.CenterPoint Energy has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets.  The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement, or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses.The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees. Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. There are seven separate bargaining units in CenterPoint Energy, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement.  In 2016, Houston Electric entered into a renegotiated collective bargaining agreement with the IBEW Local 66, which is scheduled to expire in 2020, and CERC entered into two renegotiated collective bargaining agreements with Professional Employees 36International Union Local 12, which are scheduled to expire in 2021. Two collective bargaining agreements with United Steelworkers Local 227 and United Steelworkers Local 13-1 are scheduled to expire in June and July of 2017, respectively.  The collective bargaining agreements with Gas Workers Union, Local 340 and the IBEW Local 949 are scheduled to expire in April and December of 2020, respectively. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change. We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly. We expect that new technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods of energy delivery.  Among such technological advances are distributed generation resources (e.g., rooftop solar), energy storage devices and more energy-efficient buildings and products designed to reduce consumption. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, our businesses, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.Our or Enable’s potential business strategies and strategic initiatives, including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses, may not be completed or perform as expected.From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets, form joint ventures or undertake restructurings.  However, suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable, or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all, or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe. If we or Enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, our and Enable’s future growth may be adversely affected.Any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.    For example, the success of CERC’s acquisitions of Continuum and AEM will depend, in part, on its ability to realize the expected benefits, including operating efficiencies, cost savings and customer retention, from integrating Continuum and AEM with its existing energy services business. The integration process could be costly and time consuming and may result in the following challenges, among others:  •unanticipated disruptions, issues or costs in integrating financial and accounting, information technology, communications and other systems; 37•potential inconsistencies in procedures, practices, policies, controls, and standards;  •possible differences in compensation arrangements, management perspectives and corporate culture; and •loss of or difficulties retaining valuable employees or third-party relationships.    Even with the successful integration of the businesses, CERC may not achieve the expected results. CERC anticipates that its acquisitions of Continuum and AEM will be accretive to earnings in 2017. Any of the factors addressed above could decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the transaction. Failure to fully realize the expected benefits could adversely affect CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.       In February 2016, we announced that we were exploring the use of a REIT business model for all or part of our utility businesses.  We have completed our evaluation and have decided not to pursue forming a REIT structure for our utility business or any part thereof at this time.  We also announced that we were evaluating strategic alternatives for our investment in Enable, including a sale or spin-off qualifying under Section 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and we continue to evaluate our alternatives, including retaining our investment. There can be no assurances that these evaluations will result in any specific action, and we do not intend to disclose further developments on these initiatives unless and until our board of directors approves a specific action or as otherwise required.Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. It is possible that activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity.  This may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel.Our bylaws designate the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas or, if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state district court of Harris County, Texas as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ flexibility in obtaining a judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas or, if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state district court of Harris County, Texas will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of ours to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer or other employee of ours pursuant to any provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time) or the Texas Business Organizations Code, and (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a shareholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees or agents. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcome of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.We are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note14 of the consolidated financial statements.  Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.38We are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors including unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies.Our businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories, energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth. Declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in our regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity. Although Houston Electric is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.For example, our electric business is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country.  Given the significant decline in energy and commodity prices in 2015 and 2016, and resulting low commodity prices which we expect to continue in 2017, the rate of growth in employment in Houston has declined. In the event economic conditions further decline, the rate of growth in Houston and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate. Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition.Growth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.Certain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.Some or all of these factors, could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Furthermore, we currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs. Should we be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or prevent fraud may be adversely affected. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could impact our businesses and the trading price of our securities. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If our efforts to maintain internal controls are not successful, we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting and processes in the future or we are unable to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees.We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions.39"
12,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2016-02-26,"Risk Factors
  We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. We also own interests in Enable, a publicly traded midstream master limited partnership jointly controlled by CERC Corp. and OGE. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in Enable:Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial Condition As a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from Enable to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.We derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries, including our interests in Enable. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries, including Enable, in order to meet our payment obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock. In general, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.  For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in Enable, please read “— Additional Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.”Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.As of December 31, 2015, we had $8.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $2.7 billion of non-recourse transition and system restoration bonds. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2018. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $1.2 billion on transition and system restoration bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;18•our exposure to GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn) (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI)), a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG, in connection with certain indemnification obligations;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2015, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $2.1 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including (a) approximately $56 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected on our financial statements because CenterPoint Houston is both the obligor on the bonds and the current owner of the bonds, and (b) approximately $118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. CenterPoint Houston may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $4.2 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2015. However, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity-method investments could reduce our earnings.Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired.  Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  For investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary. For example, based on the sustained low Enable common unit price and further declines in such price during the three months ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as well as the market outlook for continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry, we determined in connection with our preparation of financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, that an other than temporary decrease in the value of our investment in Enable had occurred.  We wrote down the value of our investment in Enable to its estimated fair value which resulted in impairment charges of $250 million as of September 30, 2015 and $975 million as of December 31, 2015. Our total impairment loss included impairment charges totaling $1,846 million composed of the impairments of our investment in Enable of $1,225 million and our share, $621 million, of impairment charges Enable recorded for goodwill and long-lived assets.  If Enable’s unit price, distributions or earnings further decline for reasons including, but not limited to, continued declines in commodity prices and producer activity, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in Enable. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable is $11.09 per unit, which includes the common and subordinated units representing limited partner interests, general partner interest and incentive distribution rights we hold. As of December 31, 2015, Enable’s common unit price closed at $9.20. The lowest close price for Enable’s common units through February 12, 2016 was $5.80. Considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment.  A sustained low Enable common unit price or further declines in such price could result in our recording further impairment charges in the future. If we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.19Poor investment performance of the pension plan and factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.We maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees. Our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability.  In addition to affecting our funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us, our subsidiaries or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or Enable.We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk. We, our subsidiaries or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution BusinessRate regulation of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPoint Houston’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs. CenterPoint Houston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, which is referred to as “regulatory lag.” The regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services.CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months. Unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition. Conversely, extreme warm weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The AMS deployed throughout CenterPoint Houston’s service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data. CenterPoint Houston has deployed an AMS throughout its service territory.  The deployment consisted, among other elements, of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15-minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to CenterPoint Houston over a bi-directional communications system installed for that purpose. The AMS integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers’ premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer’s change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service.  Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the  operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components 20of the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of CenterPoint Houston, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse effect on CenterPoint Houston’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CenterPoint Houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by CenterPoint Houston and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE, a functionally independent division of ERCOT.  Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject CenterPoint Houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.  In addition, if CenterPoint Houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.A substantial portion of CenterPoint Houston’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.CenterPoint Houston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2015, CenterPoint Houston did business with approximately 69 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and CenterPoint Houston thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. The Texas Utility Commission revised its regulations in 2009 to (i) increase the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (Energy Future Holdings). CenterPoint Houston’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2015 was $195 million. Approximately 34% and 11% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings, respectively.  In April 2014, Energy Future Holdings publicly disclosed that it and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, excluding Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC and its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments CenterPoint Houston had received from such REP.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services BusinessesRate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CERC’s rates for NGD are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time, which is referred to as “regulatory lag.” The regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.CERC’s natural gas distribution and energy services businesses, including transportation and storage, are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations and financial condition.CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which 21CERC operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements. A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.  Unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.Proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP We hold a substantial limited partnership interest in Enable (55.4% of Enable’s outstanding limited partnership interests as of December 31, 2015), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  We also hold $363 million of Enable’s Series A Preferred Units.  Accordingly, our future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable and the value of our interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of our interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors
” that are applicable to Enable.22Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.Both CERC Corp. and OGE hold their limited partnership interests in Enable in the form of both common units and subordinated units. Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”). The principal difference between Enable’s common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period, holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters. If Enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units, its subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. Accordingly, if Enable is unable to pay its minimum quarterly distribution, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable may be adversely affected. Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it to pay the minimum quarterly distribution. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;•the level of competition from other midstream energy companies;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:•the level and timing of its capital expenditures;•the cost of acquisitions;•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner; and•other business risks affecting its cash levels. 23The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its units, including the Series A Preferred Units, to us depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.  The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution on its units, including the Series A Preferred Units, depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.We are not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.Enable is controlled jointly by CERC Corp. and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of Enable.  The board of directors of Enable’s general partner is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by us, the president and chief executive officer of Enable’s general partner and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the New York Stock Exchange.  Accordingly, we are not able to exercise control over Enable.Although we jointly control Enable with OGE, we may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.CERC Corp. and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner, as well as limited partnership interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Enable and its unitholders. Our joint control of the general partner of Enable may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable.  In resolving these conflicts, we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement.  These circumstances could subject us to claims that, in favoring our own interests and those of our affiliates, we breached a fiduciary duty to Enable or its unitholders.Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks.Enable generates a substantial portion of its gross margins under long-term, fee-based agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 81% of Enable’s gross margin was generated from contracts that are fee-based and approximately 56% of its gross margin was attributable to fees associated with firm contracts or contracts with minimum volume commitment features.  As these and other contracts expire, Enable may have to negotiate extensions or renewals with existing suppliers and customers or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. Enable may be unable to obtain new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. It also may be unable to maintain the economic structure of a particular contract with an existing customer or the overall mix of its contract portfolio. For example, depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of a contract renewal, gathering and processing customers with fixed-fee or fixed-margin contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements. To the extent Enable is unable to renew its existing contracts on terms that are favorable to it, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its revenue, results of operations and distributable cash flow could be adversely affected.Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its firm transportation and storage services revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its transportation and storage services and its consolidated financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. Enable provides firm transportation and storage services to certain key customers on its system. Its major transportation customers are affiliates of CenterPoint Energy, Laclede, OGE, American Electric Power Company, Inc. and XTO Energy Inc., an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The loss of all or even a portion of the interstate or intrastate transportation and storage services for any of these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others.Enable’s businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil production. Enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to its 24systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, Enable’s cash flows associated with wells currently connected to its systems will decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, Enable’s customers must continually obtain new natural gas and crude oil supplies. The primary factors affecting Enable’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near these systems, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand capacity as needed. If Enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing, transportation and storage facilities will decline, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow. Enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:•the availability and cost of capital; •prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil; •levels of reserves; •geological considerations; •environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and •the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Enable’s control. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Declines in natural gas, NGL or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity. Over the course of 2015 and continuing into 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years from a high of $13.31 per MMBtu in July 2008 to $1.63 per MMBtu at December 23, 2015 and $145.31 per barrel in July 2008 to $26.19 per barrel at February 11, 2016, respectively. A sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions. In addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems and processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time. In addition to capital expenditures to support growth, the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require Enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time, which will reduce its distributable cash flow.Because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Reductions in drilling activity would result in Enable’s inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could have a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations and distributable cash flow.Enable’s industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and distributable cash flow.Enable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Enable’s competitors include large crude oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil than Enable. Some of 25these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services Enable provides to its customers. Excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by Enable’s interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact Enable’s ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire. In addition, Enable’s customers that are significant producers of natural gas or crude oil may develop their own gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems in lieu of using Enable’s systems. Enable’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. Further, natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end users, including electricity, coal and liquid fuels. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and transportation services. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and distributable cash flow.Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.Enable’s business plan calls for investment in capital improvements and additions. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital will be approximately $375 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately $105 million to $125 million for the year ending December 31, 2016. For example, Enable is currently constructing two cryogenic processing facilities that it plans to connect to its super-header system in Grady and Garvin County, Oklahoma, which Enable expects will add 400 MMcf per day of combined natural gas processing capacity.  Enable expects that the first of the two new plants (the Bradley II Plant) will be completed in the second quarter of 2016. Enable expects that the second plant (the Wildhorse Plant), a 200 MMcf per day plant, will be completed in late 2017. Enable also plans to construct natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure to support producer activity.The construction of additions or modifications to Enable’s existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond Enable’s control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed its estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating, processing, compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. Moreover, Enable’s revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if Enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. In addition, Enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve Enable’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.In connection with Enable’s capital investments, Enable may estimate, or engage a third party to estimate, potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and Enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond its control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, liquefied natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil 26producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. Over the course of 2015 and continuing into 2016, natural gas and crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years from a high of $13.31 per MMBtu in July 2008 to $1.63 per MMBtu at December 23, 2015 and $145.31 per barrel in July 2008 to $26.19 per barrel at February 11, 2016, respectively. Enable’s keep-whole natural gas processing arrangements, which accounted for 5% of its natural gas processed volumes in 2015, expose it to fluctuations in the pricing spreads between NGL prices and natural gas prices. Under these arrangements, the processor processes raw natural gas to extract NGLs and delivers to the producer the natural gas equivalent Btu value of raw natural gas received from the producer in the form of processed natural gas. The processor retains the processed NGLs and to sell them for its own account. Accordingly, the processor’s cost of natural gas and NGLs is a function of the difference between the value of the NGLs produced and the cost of the processed natural gas used to replace the natural gas equivalent Btu value of those NGLs. Therefore, if natural gas prices increase and NGL prices do not increase by a corresponding amount, the processor has to replace the Btu of natural gas at higher prices and cost of natural gas and NGLs sold are negatively affected.Enable’s percent-of-proceeds and percent-of-liquids natural gas processing agreements accounted for 47% of its natural gas processed volumes in 2015. Under percent-of-proceeds processing arrangements, the processor generally purchases unprocessed natural gas from the producer for a purchase price that is based on published natural gas and NGL index prices. The purchase price for unprocessed natural gas is calculated based on a percentage of the quantity of natural gas and NGLs that would result from processing the gas purchased. Accordingly, the processor’s cost of goods sold is a percentage of the index price value of the natural gas and NGLs contained in the unprocessed natural gas. If Enable is unable to sell the processed natural gas and NGLs at a higher price than it pays, Enable’s margins from sale of goods are negatively affected. Additionally, if the amount of processed natural gas or NGLs recovered during processing is less than the amount upon which the purchase price was based, Enable’s margins from sale of goods may be negatively affected.Under percent-of-liquids processing arrangement, the processor generally purchases the NGLs in unprocessed natural gas received from the producer, processes the natural gas, and returns the processed natural gas to the producer. The purchase price for NGLs is based on published NGL index prices and is calculated based on a percentage of the quantity of NGLs that would result from processing the gas. Accordingly, the processor’s cost of goods sold is a percentage of the index price value of NGLs contained in the unprocessed natural gas. If Enable is unable to sell the NGLs recovered during processing at a higher price than it pays, Enable’s margins from sale of goods are negatively affected. Additionally, if the amount of NGLs recovered during processing is less than the amount upon which the purchase price was based, Enable’s margins from sale of goods may be negatively affected.At any given time, Enable’s overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that it is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that it is a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enable’s gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.Enable has limited experience in the crude oil gathering business.In November 2013, Enable commenced operations on its initial crude oil gathering pipeline system, located in Dunn and McKenzie Counties in North Dakota within the Bakken Shale formation. Additionally in February 2014, Enable executed a crude oil gathering agreement to gather crude oil production through a new system in Williams and Mountrail Counties in North Dakota that commenced operations in the second quarter of 2015. These facilities, which will have a combined capacity of 49,500 barrels per day, are the first crude oil gathering systems that Enable has built and operated. Other operators of gathering systems in the Bakken Shale formation may have more experience in the construction, operation and maintenance of crude oil gathering systems than Enable. This relative lack of experience may hinder Enable’s ability to fully implement its business plan in a timely and cost efficient manner, which, in turn, may adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders.Enable is exposed to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its key customers could adversely affect its cash flow and results of operations.Some of Enable’s customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness. Severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit Enable’s ability to collect amounts owed to it, or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. In addition, many of Enable’s customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers’ liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to Enable. Furthermore, some of Enable’s customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their 27own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to Enable. Financial problems experienced by Enable’s customers could result in the impairment of its assets, reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of its products and services, which could reduce Enable’s revenues.Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under long-term, fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts.Enable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. Generally, negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the FERC, but it is possible that costs to perform services under “negotiated rate” contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by Enable’s systems and, therefore, decrease the cash it has available for distribution. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 60% of Enable’s contracted transportation firm capacity and 44% of its contracted storage firm capacity was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts.  These contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC. Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between “recourse rates” (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current FERC policies.If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable depends upon third-party natural gas pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its transportation systems. Enable also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of the processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. For example, an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enable’s processing plants and gathering systems, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of natural gas Enable gathers and NGLs it is able to produce. Additionally, Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities. Since Enable does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within its control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected.Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. A loss of these rights, through Enable’s inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position and results of operations.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Spectra Energy Partners, LP, DCP Midstream Partners, LP, Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside Enable’s control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, Enable’s business may be adversely affected.Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:•Enable’s joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;28•Enable’s joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations, leaving Enable liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;•Enable may be unable to control the amount of cash it will receive from the joint venture;•Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners;•Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;•Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;•Enable’s joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and•disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect Enable’s financial condition, results of operations and distributable cash flows. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.Enable’s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources.Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally, Enable’s cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.Enable depends on access to the capital markets to fund its expansion capital expenditures. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable’s common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.If Enable does not make acquisitions or is unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, its future growth will be adversely affected.Enable’s growth strategy includes, in part, the ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in its cash generated from operations. If Enable is unable to make these accretive acquisitions either because: (i) it is unable to identify attractive acquisition targets or it is unable to negotiate purchase contracts on acceptable terms, (ii) it is unable to obtain acquisition financing on economically acceptable terms, or (iii) it is outbid by competitors, then its future growth and ability to increase distributions will be adversely affected.29 Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.As of December 31, 2015, Enable had approximately $2.7 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums on their senior notes and $363 million of long-term notes payable—affiliated companies due to CERC Corp. In addition, Enable had $236 million outstanding under its commercial paper program as of December 31, 2015. Enable has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, of which $1.2 billion was available as of December 31, 2015. Enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make quarterly distributions.Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;•dispose of assets;•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and•change the nature of its business.Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.30Enable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business.Performance of Enable’s operations require that Enable obtains and maintains a number of federal and state permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable’s compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could adversely affect Enable’s ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Additionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public and Indian lands. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations.Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Enable is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, delay or increase its costs of construction, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future.There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Enable’s operations due to its handling of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, produced water and air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. These activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants, wildlife, and natural and cultural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact Enable’s business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on, under or from Enable’s properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under its control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which Enable’s gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of Enable’s pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact Enable’s customers’ production and operations, resulting in less demand for its services.Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Hydraulic fracturing is common practice that is used by many of Enable’s customers to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Many of Enable’s customers commonly use hydraulic fracturing techniques in their drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in September 2015, the EPA published updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity.  Congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing 31process. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. Other governmental agencies, including the DOE and the EPA, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enable’s oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enable’s services to those customers.Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services. The relevant states in which Enable operates include North Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Illinois.The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer. If Enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit its profitability. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent Enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so. The regulatory agencies that regulate Enable’s systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for Enable’s services or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions.A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, but FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure you that the FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. Although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of Enable’s facilities it considers to be gathering facilities, Enable believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of Enable’s gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA or the NGPA. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect Enable’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions. In addition, if any of Enable’s facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the FERC.32Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enable’s gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.The DOT has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require operators, including Enable, to, among other things:•develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; •identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area; •improve data collection, integration, and analysis; •repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and •implement preventive and mitigating action. Although many of Enable’s pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to these requirements, it may incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt pipelines. Should Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations, it could be subject to penalties and fines. Also, the scope of the integrity management program and other related pipeline safety programs could be expanded in the future. Such future requirements could adversely affect Enable’s financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Other Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses or Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations and the operations of Enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines, distribution systems and storage, electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:•restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas.In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations;33•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•clean or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilities.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our operations and Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties; •inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment; •leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and •other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. We and OGE currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of Enable’s facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which Enable operates could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s operations. Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss 34of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco) in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn), that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI (now GenOn) were unable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could be responsible for satisfying the liability.Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary.  When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guarantees RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC’s obligations under its remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December.  The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $27 million as of December 31, 2015.  Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2015 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, GenOn was not obligated to post any security.  If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC’s obligations.If GenOn were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event GenOn might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by GenOn’s creditors might be made against us as its former owner.Reliant Energy and RRI (GenOn’s predecessor) are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets. Although these matters relate to the business and operations of GenOn, claims against Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include liability of Reliant Energy as a controlling shareholder of GenOn’s predecessor, and CES, a subsidiary of CERC Corp., is a defendant in a case now pending in federal court in Nevada. We, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, CenterPoint Houston or CERC and indemnification from GenOn were determined to be unavailable or if GenOn were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claims.In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), Reliant Energy and Texas Genco entered into a separation agreement in which Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint Houston, and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If Texas Genco were unable to satisfy a liability that had 35been so assumed or indemnified against, and provided we or Reliant Energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for satisfying the liability.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us.We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries. We anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of NRG, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the NRG affiliate, but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the NRG affiliate.Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Enable.We and Enable are subject to cyber and physical security risks related to breaches in the systems and technology used (i) to manage operations and other business processes and (ii) to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. The operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities, but also on communications among the various components of our system. As we deploy smart meters and the intelligent grid, reliance on communication between and among those components increases. Similarly, the distribution of natural gas to our customers and the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas or other commodities from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities, are dependent on communications among Enable’s facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or other commodities into or receiving natural gas and other products from Enable’s facilities. Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena, by failure of equipment or technology, or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets. Cyber-attacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability.  Neither we nor Enable is fully insured against all cyber-security risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on either our, or Enable’s, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, electrical distribution and transmission facilities and gas distribution and pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt either our or Enable’s ability to conduct our respective businesses and have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.  In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the United States regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or CenterPoint Energy data by cyber-crime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •information technology system failures that impair our information technology infrastructure or disrupt normal business operations;36•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, leaks, floods, droughts, hurricanes, terrorism, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations.Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or Enable’s services. Regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting legislation, including the modification of existing laws and regulations, to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements. These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA. As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Nevertheless, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and Enable’s gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues.  Another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many 37of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted.Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.CenterPoint Energy has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets.  The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement, or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.  Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. There are seven separate bargaining units in CenterPoint Energy, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement.  The collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 66 and the two collective bargaining agreements with Professional Employees International Union Local 12 are scheduled to expire in March and May of 2016. Two additional collective bargaining agreements will be renegotiated in 2017. Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change.We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly. We expect that new technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods of energy delivery. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Our or Enable’s merger and acquisition activities may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated.From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and assets.  However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable.  In addition, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and 38•acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.    Our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.  Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company. It is possible that activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity.  This may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcome of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.We are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Note14 of the consolidated financial statements.  Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance. Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.We are exposed to risks related to unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories. Our businesses are affected by the economic climate in our service territories, which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth or result in reduced energy consumption by our customers. Some economic sectors important to our customer base may be affected. For example, our business is largely concentrated in Houston, Texas, where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country.  Given the significant decline in energy and commodity prices in 2015, the rate of growth in employment in Houston has declined. In the event economic conditions further decline, the rate of growth in Houston and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate. Increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial condition.Our businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees. We are committed to living our core values of safety, integrity, accountability, initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations. Despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct, it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct, fail to uphold our core values, and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud, misappropriation, bribery or corruption, fraudulent related-party transactions and serious breaches of our Ethics and Compliance Code and Standards of Conduct/Business Ethics policy, among other policies. If such intentional misconduct by employees should occur, it could result in substantial liability, higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny and negative public perceptions"
0,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2015-02-26,"Risk Factors
  We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. We also own interests in Enable, a publicly traded midstream master limited partnership jointly controlled by CERC Corp. and OGE. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in Enable:Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionAs a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from Enable to meet our payment obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.We derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries, including our interests in Enable. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries, including Enable, in order to meet our payment obligations. In general, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.  For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount 18of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in Enable, please read “- Additional Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP - Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.”Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.If we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.As of December 31, 2014, we had $8.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $3.0 billion of non-recourse transition and system restoration bonds. As of December 31, 2014, approximately $1.1 billion principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2017. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $1.2 billion on transition and system restoration bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•our exposure to GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn) (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI)), a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, in connection with certain indemnification obligations;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2014, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including (a) $290 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements because we are both the obligor on the bonds and the current owner of the bonds, (b) approximately $56 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected on our financial statements because CenterPoint Houston is both the obligor on the bonds and the current owner of the bonds, and (c) approximately $118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. CenterPoint Houston may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $3.9 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2014. However, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Other Matters - Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.19Poor investment performance of the pension plan and factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.We maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all employees. Our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability.  In addition to affecting our funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us, our subsidiaries or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or Enable.We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk. We, our subsidiaries or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.An impairment of goodwill, long-lived assets, including intangible assets, and equity-method investments could reduce our earnings.Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets.  Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired.  Long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  For investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary.  For example, if Enable’s unit price, distributions or earnings decline for reasons including, but not limited to, continued declines in commodity prices and producer activity, and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary, we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in Enable. The carrying value of CenterPoint Energy’s investment in Enable is $19.33 per unit.  As of December 31, 2014, Enable’s common unit price closed at  $19.39 (approximately $14 million above carrying value). The lowest close price for Enable’s common units in January 2015 was $17.34 (approximately $465 million below carrying value). If we determine that an impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution BusinessRate regulation of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPoint Houston’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs. CenterPoint Houston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months.  Unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, extreme warm weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.20Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services.CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.A substantial portion of CenterPoint Houston’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.CenterPoint Houston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2014, CenterPoint Houston did business with approximately 70 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and CenterPoint Houston thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. The Texas Utility Commission revised its regulations in 2009 to (i) increase the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings Corp. (Energy Future Holdings). CenterPoint Houston’s aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2014 was $195 million. Approximately 36% and 10% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings, respectively.  In April 2014, Energy Future Holdings publicly disclosed that it and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, excluding Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC and its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments CenterPoint Houston had received from such REP.CenterPoint Houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by CenterPoint Houston and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE, a functionally independent division of ERCOT.  Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject CenterPoint Houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.  In addition, if CenterPoint Houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.The AMS deployed throughout CenterPoint Houston’s service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data.CenterPoint Houston has deployed an AMS throughout its service territory.  The deployment consisted, among other elements, of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15-minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to CenterPoint Houston over a bi-directional communications system installed for that purpose.  The AMS integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers’ premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer’s change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service.  Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the  operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of CenterPoint Houston, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse effect on CenterPoint Houston’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.21Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services BusinessesRate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CERC’s rates for NGD are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.CERC’s natural gas distribution and energy services businesses are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations and financial condition.CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for NGD, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) decrease  demand for  natural gas in the areas in which CERC operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements. CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.  Unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition.  Conversely, extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurring.The states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.Proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-22keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating.These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP We hold a substantial limited partnership interest in Enable (55.4% of Enable’s outstanding limited partnership interests as of December 31, 2014), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  Accordingly, our future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable and the value of our interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and, hence, the value of our interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors
” that are applicable to Enable.Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.Both CERC Corp. and OGE hold their limited partnership interests in Enable in the form of both common units and subordinated units. Enable is expected to pay a minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2875 per unit, or $1.15 per unit on an annualized basis, on its outstanding units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”). The principal difference between Enable’s common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period, holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters. If Enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units, its subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions. Accordingly, if Enable is unable to pay its minimum quarterly distribution, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable may be adversely affected. Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it to pay the minimum quarterly distribution. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:•the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas and crude oil that it handles;•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas and crude oil;•the volume of natural gas and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;•the level of competition from other midstream energy companies;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:•the level and timing of its capital expenditures;•the cost of acquisitions;23•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner; and•other business risks affecting its cash levels. The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to us depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which Enable records net income.  The amount of cash Enable has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flows and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.We are not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.Enable is controlled jointly by CERC Corp. and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of Enable.  The board of directors of Enable’s general partner is composed of an equal number of directors appointed by OGE and by us, the president and chief executive officer of Enable’s general partner and three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the New York Stock Exchange.  Accordingly, we are not able to exercise control over Enable.Although we jointly control Enable with OGE, we may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.CERC Corp. and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner, as well as limited partnership interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Enable and its unitholders. Our joint control of the general partner of Enable may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties including claims of conflicts of interest related to Enable.  In resolving these conflicts, we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement.  These circumstances could subject us to claims that, in favoring our own interests and those of our affiliates, we breached a fiduciary duty to Enable or its unitholders.Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks.Enable generates a substantial portion of its gross margins under long-term, fee-based agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 72% of Enable’s gross margin was generated from contracts that are fee-based and approximately 50% of its gross margin was attributable to fees associated with firm contracts or contracts with minimum volume commitment features.  As these and other contracts expire, Enable may have to negotiate extensions or renewals with existing suppliers and customers or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. Enable may be unable to obtain new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. It also may be unable to maintain the economic structure of a particular contract with an existing customer or the overall mix of its contract portfolio. For example, depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of a contract renewal, gathering and processing customers with fixed-fee or fixed-margin contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements. To the extent Enable is unable to renew its existing contracts on terms that are favorable to it, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its revenue, results of operations and distributable cash flow could be adversely affected.24Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its firm transportation and storage services revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its transportation and storage services and its consolidated financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. Enable provides firm transportation and storage services to certain key customers on its system. Its major transportation customers are affiliates of CenterPoint Energy, Laclede Group (Laclede), OGE, American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) and XTO Energy Inc., an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The loss of all or even a portion of the interstate or intrastate transportation and storage services for any of these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could adversely affect Enable’s combined and consolidated financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others.Enable’s businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production. Enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to its systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, Enable’s cash flows associated with wells currently connected to its systems will decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, Enable’s customers must continually obtain new natural gas and crude oil supplies. The primary factors affecting Enable’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near these systems, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand capacity as needed. If Enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing, transportation and storage facilities will decline, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow. Enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:•the availability and cost of capital; •prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil; •levels of reserves; •geological considerations; •environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and •the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas and crude oil reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Enable’s control. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Declines in natural gas or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity. A sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.In addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time. In addition to capital expenditures 25to support growth, the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require Enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time, which will reduce its distributable cash flow.Because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Reductions in drilling activity would result in Enable’s inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow.Enable’s industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its results of operations and distributable cash flow.Enable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Enable’s competitors include large crude oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil than Enable. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services Enable provides to its customers. Excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by Enable’s interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact Enable’s ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire. In addition, Enable’s customers that are significant producers of natural gas may develop their own gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems in lieu of using Enable’s systems. Enable’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. Further, natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including electricity, coal and liquid fuels. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and transportation services. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and distributable cash flow.Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.Enable’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions. In Enable’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014,  Enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital expenditures could range from approximately  $600 million to $800 million for the year ending December 31, 2015, not including opportunities currently under evaluation which could add up to an additional $300 million of expansion capital expenditures.  For example, Enable is currently constructing two cryogenic processing facilities that it plans to connect to its super-header system in Grady County, Oklahoma, which Enable expects will add 400 MMcf/d of natural gas processing capacity.  Enable expects that the first of the two new plants (the Bradley Plant) will be completed in the first quarter of 2015. Enable expects that the second plant (the Grady County Plant), a 200 MMcf/d plant, will be completed in the first quarter of 2016. Enable also plans to construct significant natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure to support producer activity in its growth areas, and Enable anticipates that in 2015 it will complete the construction of two crude gathering systems in North Dakota’s Bakken Shale formation with a combined capacity of 49,500 Bbl/d.  The construction of additions or modifications to Enable’s existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond Enable’s control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed its estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating, processing, compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. Moreover, Enable’s revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if Enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. In addition, Enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve Enable’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.In connection with Enable’s capital investments, Enable may engage a third party to estimate potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return, 26which could adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and Enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond its control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. Enable’s keep-whole natural gas processing arrangements, which accounted for 7% of its natural gas processed volumes in 2014, expose it to fluctuations in the pricing spreads between NGL prices and natural gas prices. Under these arrangements, the processor processes raw natural gas to extract NGLs and pays to the producer the natural gas equivalent Btu value of raw natural gas received from the producer in the form of either processed natural gas or its cash equivalent. The processor is generally entitled to retain the processed NGLs and to sell them for its own account. Accordingly, the processor’s margin is a function of the difference between the value of the NGLs produced and the cost of the processed natural gas used to replace the natural gas equivalent Btu value of those NGLs. Therefore, if natural gas prices increase and NGL prices do not increase by a corresponding amount, the processor has to replace the Btu of natural gas at higher prices and processing margins are negatively affected.Enable’s percent-of-proceeds and percent-of-liquids natural gas processing agreements accounted for 44% of its natural gas processed volumes in 2014.  Under these arrangements, the processor generally gathers raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead, transports the natural gas through its gathering system, processes the natural gas and sells the processed natural gas and/or NGLs at prices based on published index prices. The price paid to producers is based on an agreed percentage of the actual proceeds of the sale of processed natural gas, NGLs or both, or the expected proceeds based on an index price. Enable refers to contracts in which the processor shares in specified percentages of the proceeds from the sale of natural gas and NGLs as “percent-of-proceeds” arrangements, and contracts in which the processor receives proceeds from the sale of a percentage of the NGLs or the NGLs themselves as compensation for processing services as “percent-of-liquids” arrangements.  These arrangements expose Enable to risks associated with the price of natural gas and NGLs.At any given time, Enable’s overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that it is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that it is a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enable’s gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.Enable has limited experience in the crude oil gathering business.In November 2013, Enable commenced operations on its initial crude oil gathering pipeline system, located in Dunn and McKenzie Counties in North Dakota within the Bakken Shale formation. Additionally in February 2014, Enable executed a crude oil gathering agreement to gather crude oil production through a new system in Williams and Mountrail Counties in North Dakota that is expected to commence operations in the first quarter of 2015. These facilities, with a combined capacity of 49,500 barrels per day, are the first crude oil gathering systems that Enable has built and operated. Other operators of gathering systems in the Bakken Shale formation may have more experience in the construction, operation and maintenance of crude oil gathering systems than Enable. This relative lack of experience may hinder Enable’s ability to fully implement its business plan in a timely and cost efficient manner, which, in turn, may adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders.27Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under long-term, fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts.Enable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. Generally, negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the FERC, but it is possible that costs to perform services under “negotiated rate” contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by Enable’s systems and, therefore, decrease the cash it has available for distribution. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 56% of Enable’s contracted transportation firm capacity and 44% of its contracted storage firm capacity was subscribed under such “negotiated rate” contracts.  These contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC. Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between “recourse rates” (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current FERC policies.If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Enable depends upon third-party natural gas pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its transportation systems. Enable also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of the processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. For example, an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enable’s processing plants, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of NGLs Enable is able to produce. Additionally, Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities. Since Enable does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within its control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected.Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. A loss of these rights, through Enable’s inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position and results of operations.Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including affiliates of Spectra Energy Corp, DCP Midstream Partners, LP, Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside Enable’s control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, Enable’s business may be adversely affected.Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:•Enable’s joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;•Enable’s joint venture partners may not pay their share of the joint venture’s obligations, leaving Enable liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;28•Enable may be unable to control the amount of cash we will receive from the joint venture;•Enable may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners;•Enable may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;•Enable’s insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both Enable and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;•Enable’s joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and•disputes between Enable and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.The risks described above or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with its joint venture partners could adversely affect its ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect Enable’s financial condition and results of operations. The agreements under which Enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If Enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of Enable’s joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and Enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.Enable’s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources.Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders.  As a result, Enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally, Enable’s cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.If Enable does not make acquisitions or is unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, its future growth will be adversely affected.Enable’s growth strategy includes, in part, the ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in its cash generated from operations. If Enable is unable to make these accretive acquisitions either because: (i) it is unable to identify attractive acquisition targets or it is unable to negotiate purchase contracts on acceptable terms, (ii) it is unable to obtain acquisition financing on economically acceptable terms, or (iii) it is outbid by competitors, then our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be adversely affected. Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.As of December 31, 2014, Enable had approximately $1.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums on their senior notes. Enable has $363 million of long-term notes payable-affiliated companies due to CERC Corp. Enable has a $1.4 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, of which $1.1 billion was available as of December 31, 2014. As of January 31, 2015, Enable had the ability to issue up to $1.2 billion in commercial paper, subject to available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and market conditions, to manage the timing of cash flows and fund short-term working capital deficits.   As of January 31, 2015, $224 million was outstanding 29under Enable’s commercial paper program. Enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make quarterly distributions.Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;•dispose of assets;•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and•change the nature of its business.Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Enable is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, delay or increase its costs of construction, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future.30There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Enable’s operations due to its handling of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. These activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants, wildlife, and natural and cultural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact Enable’s business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on, under or from Enable’s properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under its control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which Enable’s gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of Enable’s pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact Enable’s customers’ production and operations, resulting in less demand for its services.Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Many of Enable’s customers commonly use hydraulic fracturing techniques in their drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in January 2015, the EPA indicated its intention to propose more stringent rules regulating methane and VOC emissions from hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity.  Congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the EPA, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater.  If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enable’s oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enable’s services to those customers.Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services. The relevant states in which Enable operates include North Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Illinois.The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable’s pipeline businesses could suffer. If Enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit its profitability. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent Enable from raising 31its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so. The regulatory agencies that regulate Enable’s systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for Enable’s services or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions.A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, but FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure you that the FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. Although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of Enable’s facilities it considers to be gathering facilities, Enable believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of Enable’s gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA or the NGPA. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect Enable’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions. In addition, if any of Enable’s facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the FERC.Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enable’s gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.The DOT has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require operators, including Enable, to, among other things:•develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; •identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area; •improve data collection, integration, and analysis; •repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and •implement preventive and mitigating action. Although many of Enable’s pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to these requirements, it may incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt pipelines. Should Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations, it could be subject to penalties and 32fines. Also, the scope of the integrity management program and other related pipeline safety programs could be expanded in the future.Other Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses or Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, electric transmission and distribution systems, and the facilities that support these systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:•restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•enjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas.In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:•construct or acquire new facilities and equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations;•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•clean or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilities.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored, disposed or released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its 33regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:•damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties; •inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment; •leaks of natural gas, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and •other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. We and OGE currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of Enable’s facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which Enable operates could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s operations. Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that Enable considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles.  Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco) in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn), that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI (now GenOn) were unable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could be responsible for satisfying the liability.Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary.  When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guarantees RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC’s obligations under its 34remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December.  The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $42 million as of December 31, 2014.  Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2014 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, GenOn was not obligated to post any security.  If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC’s obligations.If GenOn were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event GenOn might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by GenOn’s creditors might be made against us as its former owner.Reliant Energy and RRI (GenOn’s predecessor) are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets. Although these matters relate to the business and operations of GenOn, claims against Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include liability of Reliant Energy as a controlling shareholder of GenOn’s predecessor. We, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, CenterPoint Houston or CERC and indemnification from GenOn were determined to be unavailable or if GenOn were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claims.In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), Reliant Energy and Texas Genco entered into a separation agreement in which Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint Houston, and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG) were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against, and provided we or Reliant Energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for satisfying the liability.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us.We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries. We anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of NRG, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the NRG affiliate, but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the NRG affiliate.Cyber-attacks, physical security breaches, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Enable.We and Enable are subject to cyber- and physical security risks related to breaches in the systems and technology used (i) to manage operations and other business processes and (ii) to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business.  The operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities, but also on communications among the various components of our system.  As we deploy smart meters and the intelligent grid, reliance on communication between and among those components increases.  Similarly, the distribution of natural gas to our customers and the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas or other commodities from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities, are dependent on communications among Enable’s facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or other commodities into or receiving natural gas and other products from Enable’s facilities.  Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena, by failure of equipment or technology, or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets.  Cyber-attacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability.  Neither we nor Enable is fully insured 35against all cyber-security risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on either our, or Enable’s, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In addition, electrical distribution and transmission facilities and gas distribution and pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt either our or Enable’s ability to conduct our respective businesses and have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Failure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us.  In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the United States regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or CenterPoint Energy data by cyber-crime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions.Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including:•operator error or failure of equipment or processes;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes; •information technology system failures that impair our information technology infrastructure or disrupt normal business operations;•information technology failure that affects our ability to access customer information or causes us to lose confidential or proprietary data that materially and adversely affects our reputation or exposes us to legal claims; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, terrorism, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.Our success depends upon our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key employees and identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel. Our success depends on our ability to attract, effectively transition and retain key personnel. The inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations. In addition, because of the reliance on our management team, our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management. The retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategies.Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations.Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.36Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or Enable’s services.The United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the most recent United Nations Climate Change Conference in Lima, Peru, in 2014.  Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. In addition, the EPA expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements to include upstream petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year.  These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA.  As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a  consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Nevertheless, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues.  Another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted.Aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial results.CenterPoint Energy has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets.  The age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement, or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs.  Failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses. The operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees.  Several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions. There are seven separate bargaining units in CenterPoint Energy, each with a unique collective bargaining agreement.  These contracts will be renegotiated over the next two years.  Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. These potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.37Our businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change.We operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection, processing systems, software and other technology. Some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly. We expect that new technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide cost-effective and reliable methods of energy delivery. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a cost-effective manner and to offer, on a timely basis, reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards. If we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence, or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.Our or Enable’s merger and acquisition activities may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated.From time to time, we and Enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and assets.  However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or Enable, as the case may be, find acceptable.  In addition, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:•acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we or Enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we or Enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards, controls and procedures.    We are involved in numerous legal proceedings, the outcome of which are uncertain, and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial results.We are subject to numerous legal proceedings, the most significant of which are summarized in Footnote 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance.  Final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results"
16,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2014-02-26,"Risk Factors
We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. We also own interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP (Enable), a midstream partnership jointly controlled by CERC Corp. and OGE. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in Enable: Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution BusinessA substantial portion of CenterPoint Houston’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.CenterPoint Houston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2013, CenterPoint Houston did business with approximately 70 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another REP or a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and CenterPoint Houston thus remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to another REP or the provider of last resort. The Texas Utility Commission revised its regulations in 2009 to (i) increase the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston's billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG, Just Energy Group, Inc. (Just Energy Group) and Energy Future Holdings. CenterPoint Houston's aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2013 was $172 million.  Approximately 38%, 8% and 8% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG, Just Energy Group and Energy Future Holdings, respectively.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, Energy Future Holdings publicly disclosed that it had engaged in discussions with certain of its creditors with respect to the capital structure of Energy Future Holdings and its affiliates, including the possibility of a restructuring transaction in bankruptcy. The disclosures do not make clear whether those discussions included or addressed the capital structure of affiliates of Energy Future Holdings that are REPs.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments CenterPoint Houston had received from such REP.18Rate regulation of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPoint Houston’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CenterPoint Houston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services.CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months.CenterPoint Houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by CenterPoint Houston and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE, a functionally independent division of ERCOT.  Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject CenterPoint Houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.  In addition, if CenterPoint Houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.   The AMS deployed throughout CenterPoint Houston's service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data. CenterPoint Houston has deployed an AMS throughout its service territory.  The deployment consisted, among other elements, of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15-minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to CenterPoint Houston over a bi-directional communications system installed for that purpose.  The AMS integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers' premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer's change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service.  Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the  operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of CenterPoint Houston, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse effect on CenterPoint Houston's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution and Energy Services BusinessesRate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CERC’s rates for Gas Operations are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. 19CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas,  which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s natural gas distribution and energy services businesses are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations and financial condition. CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for Gas Operations, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which CERC operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements. A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.The states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.Proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating. These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.20Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionIf we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.As of December 31, 2013, we had $8.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $3.4 billion of non-recourse transition and system restoration bonds. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $593 million principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2016. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $1.1 billion on transition and system restoration bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•our exposure to GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn) (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI)), a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, in connection with certain indemnification obligations;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2013, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, including (a) $290 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements because we are both the obligor on the bonds and the current owner of the bonds, (b) approximately $118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated and (c) approximately $183 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is obligated. Additionally, as of December 31, 2013, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $102 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage. CenterPoint Houston may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $3.9 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2013. However, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Other Matters — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.As a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from Enable, to meet our payment obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.We derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries, including our interests in Enable. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries, including Enable, in order to meet our payment obligations. In general, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.  For a discussion of risks that may impact the amount 21of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in Enable, please read “— Additional Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LP — Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.”  Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.Poor investment performance of the pension plan and factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.We maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all employees. Our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability.  In addition to affecting our funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.The use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us, our subsidiaries or Enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or Enable.We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. Enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk. We, our subsidiaries or Enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.Other Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Businesses or Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, and electric transmission and distribution systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as: •restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas.In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to: •construct or acquire new equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations;22•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilities.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco) in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn), that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI (now GenOn) were unable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could be responsible for satisfying the liability.Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary.  When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guarantees RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC’s obligations under its 23remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December.  The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $58 million as of December 31, 2013.  Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2013 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, GenOn was not obligated to post any security.  If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC’s obligations.If GenOn were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event GenOn might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by GenOn’s creditors might be made against us as its former owner.Reliant Energy and RRI (GenOn’s predecessor) are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets. Although these matters relate to the business and operations of GenOn, claims against Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include liability of Reliant Energy as a controlling shareholder of GenOn’s predecessor. We, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, CenterPoint Houston or CERC and indemnification from GenOn were determined to be unavailable or if GenOn were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claims.In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), Reliant Energy and Texas Genco entered into a separation agreement in which Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint Houston, and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG) were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against, and provided we or Reliant Energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for satisfying the liability.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us. We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries. We anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of NRG, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the NRG affiliate, but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the NRG affiliate.Cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Enable.We and Enable are subject to cyber-security risks related to breaches in the systems and technology used (i) to manage operations and other business processes and (ii) to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business.  The operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities, but also on communications among the various components of our system.  As we deploy smart meters and the intelligent grid, reliance on communication between and among those components increases.  Similarly, the distribution of natural gas to our customers and the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas or other commodities from Enable’s gathering, processing and pipeline facilities, are dependent on communications among Enable’s facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas or other commodities into or receiving natural gas and other products from Enable’s facilities.  Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena, by failure of equipment or technology, or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability or Enable’s ability to conduct operations and control assets.  Cyber-attacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt operations and critical business functions, adversely affect reputation, and subject us or Enable to possible legal claims and liability.  Neither we nor Enable is fully insured against all cyber-24security risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on either our, or Enable’s, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In addition, electrical distribution and transmission facilities and gas distribution and pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt either our or Enable’s ability to conduct our respective businesses and have a material adverse effect on either our or Enable’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions. Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including: •operator error or failure of equipment or processes;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes;•information technology system failures; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.Our merger and acquisition activities may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated.From time to time, we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and assets.  However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable.  In addition, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following: •acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures.    Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations. Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.25Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or Enable’s services.The United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar in 2012.  Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. In addition, the EPA expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements to include upstream petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year.  These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA.  As a distributor and transporter of natural gas, or a  consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s or Enable’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements, as applicable, could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Nevertheless, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted.Additional Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Interests in Enable Midstream Partners, LPWe hold a substantial limited partnership interest in Enable (58.3% of Enable’s outstanding limited partnership interests as of December 31, 2013), as well as 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner and a 40% interest in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  Accordingly, our future earnings, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be affected by the performance of Enable, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable and the value of our interests in Enable.  Factors that may have a material impact on Enable’s performance and cash distributions, and the value of our interests in Enable, include the risk factors outlined below, as well as the risks described elsewhere under “Risk Factors
” that are applicable to Enable.Our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from Enable than we currently expect.Prior to an initial public offering of Enable, Enable is obligated to distribute 100% of its distributable cash (as such term is defined in its partnership agreement) to its limited partners each fiscal quarter within 45 days following the end of the applicable quarter.  Following an initial public offering of Enable, (i) we expect that both CERC Corp. and OGE will hold their limited partnership interests in Enable in the form of both common units and subordinated units, and (ii) Enable is expected to pay a specified minimum quarterly distribution on its outstanding units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses, including payments to its general partner and its affiliates (referred to as “available cash”).  The principal difference between Enable’s common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period, holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters. If Enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units, its subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions.  Accordingly, if Enable is unable to pay its 26minimum quarterly distribution following is initial public offering, the amount of cash distributions we receive from Enable may be adversely affected.  Enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it to pay the minimum quarterly distribution. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things: •the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas and crude oil that it handles;•the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas and crude oil;•the volume of natural gas and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;•the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;•margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;•the level of competition from other midstream energy companies;•adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;•the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and•prevailing economic conditions.In addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including: •the level and timing of its capital expenditures;•the cost of acquisitions;•its debt service requirements and other liabilities;•fluctuations in its working capital needs;•its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;•restrictions contained in its debt agreements;•the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner; and•other business risks affecting its cash levels.  We are not able to exercise control over Enable, which entails certain risks.Enable is controlled equally by CERC Corp. and OGE, who each own 50% of the management rights in the general partner of Enable.  The general partner of Enable is currently governed by a board made up of an equal number of representatives designated by each of us and OGE and an independent director. In addition, until the completion of Enable’s initial public offering, ArcLight will have approval rights over certain material activities of Enable, including material increases in capital expenditures and certain equity issuances, entering into transactions with related parties, and acquiring, pledging or disposing of certain material assets.  Following completion of Enable’s initial public offering, the board of directors of Enable’s general partner is expected to be composed of an equal number of  directors appointed by OGE and by us, the president and chief executive officer of Enable’s general partner and up to three directors who are independent as defined under the independence standards established by the New York Stock Exchange.  Accordingly, we are not able to exercise control over Enable.  27We may not realize the benefits we expect from our interests in Enable.Enable may under-perform, causing our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community's expectations. In addition, Enable may not be able to achieve anticipated operational and commercial synergies or realize expected growth opportunities.  The success of Enable will in part depend on its ability to integrate the operations of the businesses we contributed to Enable with those contributed by OGE and ArcLight. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The potential difficulties of integrating the operations include, among others:•implementing our business plan for the combined business;•changes in applicable laws and regulations or conditions imposed by regulators;•retaining key employees;•operating risks inherent in the contributed businesses;•realizing growth, revenue and expense targets; and•unanticipated issues, costs, obligations and liabilities.Although we jointly control Enable with OGE, we may have conflicts of interest with Enable that could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to Enable and its unitholders.CERC Corp. and OGE each own 50% of the management rights in Enable’s general partner, as well as limited partnership interests in Enable, and interests in the incentive distribution rights held by Enable’s general partner.  Conflicts of interest may arise between us and Enable and its unitholders.  In resolving these conflicts, we may favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests of Enable and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not conflict with Enable’s partnership agreement.  These circumstances could subject us to claims that, in favoring our own interests and those of our affiliates, we breached a fiduciary duty to Enable or its unitholders.Enable’s contracts are subject to renewal risks.  Enable generates a substantial portion of its gross margins under long-term, fee-based agreements. As these and other contracts expire, Enable may have to negotiate extensions or renewals with existing suppliers and customers or enter into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. Enable may be unable to obtain new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. It also may be unable to maintain the economic structure of a particular contract with an existing customer or the overall mix of its contract portfolio. For example, depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of a contract renewal, gathering and processing customers with fixed-fee or fixed-margin contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements. To the extent Enable is unable to renew its existing contracts on terms that are favorable to it, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its revenue, results of operations and distributable cash flow could be adversely affected.  Enable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its firm transportation and storage services revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its transportation and storage services and its consolidated financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.  Enable provides firm transportation and storage services to certain key customers on its system. Its major transportation customers are affiliates of CenterPoint Energy, Laclede Group (Laclede), OGE, American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (Exxon). Enable’s interstate transportation and storage assets were designed and built to serve affiliates of CenterPoint Energy, Laclede, OGE and AEP.  Enable-Mississippi River Transmission, LLC’s (MRT) firm transportation and storage contracts with Laclede are scheduled to expire in 2015 and 2016. The primary terms of Enable Gas Transmission, LLC’s (EGT) firm transportation and storage contracts with CERC’s natural gas distribution business will expire in 2018. Enable’s firm transportation contract with an affiliate of AEP expires January 1, 2015 and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter unless either party provides written notice of termination to the other party at least 180 days prior to the commencement of the succeeding annual period. The stated term of the OG&E transportation and storage contract expired April 30, 2009, but the contract remained in effect from year to year thereafter.  On January 31, 2014, OG&E provided written notice of termination of the contract, effective April 30, 2014. Negotiations regarding the new contract are ongoing, and there can be no 28assurance that the new contract will be agreed upon, or, if agreed upon, that the terms of the new contract will be as favorable to Enable as the expiring contract. The loss of all or even a portion of the interstate or intrastate transportation and storage services for any of these customers, the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms, as a result of competition or otherwise, could adversely affect Enable’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.  Enable’s businesses are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others.  Enable’s businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production. Enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to its systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, Enable’s cash flows associated with wells currently connected to its systems will decline over time. To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, Enable’s customers must continually obtain new natural gas and crude oil supplies. The primary factors affecting Enable’s ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near these systems, its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand capacity as needed. If Enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing, transportation and storage facilities will decline, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow. Enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things: •the availability and cost of capital; •prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;•demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil; •levels of reserves; •geological considerations; •environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing; and •the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.Fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas and crude oil reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond Enable’s control. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Declines in natural gas or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity. A sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in Enable’s areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.  In addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on Enable’s gathering systems, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource basins in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, Enable may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time. In addition to capital expenditures to support growth, the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require Enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time, which will reduce its distributable cash flow.  Because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable’s assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Reductions in drilling activity would result in Enable's inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow. 29 Enable’s industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its results of operations and distributable cash flow.  Enable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service. Enable’s competitors include large crude oil, natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil than Enable. Some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services Enable provides to its customers. Excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by Enable’s interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact Enable’s ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire. In addition, Enable’s customers that are significant producers of natural gas may develop their own gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems in lieu of using Enable’s systems. Enable’s ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers. Further, natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end-users, including electricity, coal and liquid fuels. Increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering, processing, transportation and transportation services. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and distributable cash flow.Enable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.  Enable’s business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions.  The construction of additions or modifications to Enable’s existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond Enable’s control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed its estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating, processing, compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. Moreover, Enable’s revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if Enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. In addition, Enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve Enable’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.  In connection with Enable’s capital investments, Enable may engage a third party to estimate potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return, which could adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and Enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.Natural gas, NGL and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.  Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond its control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, LNG, NGLs and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the 30impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation.  Enable’s keep-whole natural gas processing arrangements expose it to fluctuations in the pricing spreads between NGL prices and natural gas prices. Under these arrangements, the processor processes raw natural gas to extract NGLs and pays to the producer the natural gas equivalent Btu value of raw natural gas received from the producer in the form of either processed natural gas or its cash equivalent. The processor is generally entitled to retain the processed NGLs and to sell them for its own account. Accordingly, the processor’s margin is a function of the difference between the value of the NGLs produced and the cost of the processed natural gas used to replace the natural gas equivalent Btu value of those NGLs. Therefore, if natural gas prices increase and NGL prices do not increase by a corresponding amount, the processor has to replace the Btu of natural gas at higher prices and processing margins are negatively affected.  Under Enable’s percent-of-proceeds and percent-of-liquids natural gas processing agreements, the processor generally gathers raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead, transports the natural gas through its gathering system, processes the natural gas and sells the processed natural gas and/or NGLs at prices based on published index prices. The price paid to producers is based on an agreed percentage of the actual proceeds of the sale of processed natural gas, NGLs or both, or the expected proceeds based on an index price. These arrangements expose Enable to risks associated with the price of natural gas and NGLs.  At any given time, Enable’s overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that it is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that it is a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enable’s gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.  Enable has limited experience in the crude oil gathering business.  In November 2013, Enable commenced initial operations on a new crude oil gathering pipeline system in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation, and Enable expects to place additional related assets in service in 2014. The gathering system, located in Dunn and McKenzie Counties in North Dakota, has a planned capacity of up to 19,500 barrels per day. These facilities are the first crude oil gathering system that Enable has built and operated. Other operators of gathering systems in the Bakken shale formation may have more experience in the construction, operation and maintenance of crude oil gathering systems than Enable. This relative lack of experience may hinder Enable’s ability to fully implement its business plan in a timely and cost efficient manner, which, in turn, may adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. Enable provides certain transportation and storage services under long-term, fixed-price “negotiated rate” contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, Enable’s costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts.  Enable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. Generally, negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the FERC, but it is possible that costs to perform services under “negotiated rate” contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements. If this occurs, it could decrease the cash flow realized by Enable’s systems and, therefore, decrease the cash it has available for distribution.   “Negotiated rate” contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC. Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between “recourse rates” (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current FERC policies.  If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable’s gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected.  Enable depends upon third-party natural gas pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its transportation systems. Enable also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of the processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. For example, an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enable’s processing plants, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of NGLs Enable is able to produce. Additionally, Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities. Since Enable does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, their continuing operation is not within its control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully 31unavailable for any reason, Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected.  Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.  Enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. A loss of these rights, through Enable’s inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.  Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subject it to additional risks that could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations and Enable’s financial position and results of operations.  Enable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including affiliates of Spectra Energy Corp, DCP Midstream Partners, LP, Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering LLC. Enable may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside Enable’s control. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, Enable’s business may be adversely affected.Enable’s joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly.  For example, Enable’s joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions or be in a position to take actions contrary to Enable’s instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives. These risks or the failure to continue Enable’s joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with Enable’s joint venture partners could adversely affect Enable’s ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect Enable’s financial condition and results of operations. Enable’s business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.  Enable’s operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:  •damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties; •inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles, farm and utility equipment; •leaks of natural gas, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities; •ruptures, fires and explosions; and •other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of Enable’s operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which Enable operates could have a material adverse effect on its operations. Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. We and OGE currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of Enable’s facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the 32insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable’s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.Enable’s ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources.  Enable expects that it will distribute all of its “available cash” to its unitholders following its initial public offering. As a result, Enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. As a result, to the extent Enable is unable to finance growth externally, Enable’s cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow. In addition, because Enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash, its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.  To the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that Enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in Enable’s partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute to its unitholders.  If Enable does not make acquisitions or is unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, its future growth will be limited.  Enable’s ability to grow depends, in part, on its ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in its cash generated from operations. If Enable is unable to make accretive acquisitions either because: (i) it is unable to identify attractive acquisition targets or it is unable to negotiate purchase contracts on acceptable terms, (ii) it is unable to obtain acquisition financing on economically acceptable terms, or (iii) it is outbid by competitors, then its future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited.Enable’s debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.As of December 31, 2013, Enable had approximately $1.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding and $200 million of short-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums on senior notes. Enable has $363 million of long-term notes payable-affiliated companies due to CenterPoint Energy. Enable has a $1.4 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, of which $1.1 billion was available as of December 31, 2013. As of January 2014, Enable has the ability to issue up to $1.4 billion in commercial paper, subject to available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and market conditions.  Enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of Enable’s debt could have important consequences, including the following:•the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;•a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;•Enable’s debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally; and•Enable’s debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.Enable’s ability to service its debt will depend upon, among other things, its future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond Enable’s control. If operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness, Enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all. 33Enable’s credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond Enable’s control, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make quarterly distributions.Enable’s credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit its ability to:•permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;•incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;•dispose of assets;•merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;•enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm’s length terms; and•change the nature of its business.Enable’s credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Enable’s ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios. In addition, Enable’s credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.Enable’s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Enable’s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Enable violates any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, Enable’s lenders’ commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable’s results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions.  Enable is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, delay or increase its costs of construction, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future.  There is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Enable’s operations due to its handling of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. These activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants, wildlife, and natural and cultural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact Enable’s business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on, under or from Enable’s properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under its control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which Enable’s gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of Enable’s pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact Enable’s customers’ production and operations, resulting in less demand for its services.34Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by Enable’s customers, which could adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Many of Enable’s customers commonly use hydraulic fracturing techniques in their drilling and completion programs. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, Congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enable’s oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enable’s services to those customers.  In addition, certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. A draft final report drawing conclusions about the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources is currently expected to be available for public comment and peer review in 2014. Moreover, the EPA has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities by 2014. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Department of the Interior, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. President Obama created the Interagency Working Group on Unconventional Natural Gas and Oil by Executive Order on April 13, 2012, which is charged with coordinating and aligning federal agency research and scientific studies on unconventional natural gas and oil resources, including hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms. Enable’s operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on Enable’s results of operations and ability to make cash distributions.  The rates charged by several of Enable’s pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services Enable may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types, or terms and conditions, of service Enable might propose or offer, the profitability of Enable's pipeline businesses could suffer. If Enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit its profitability. Furthermore, competition from other pipeline systems may prevent Enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so. The regulatory agencies that regulate Enable’s systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for Enable’s services or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions.  Enable’s natural gas interstate pipelines are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or the NGPA, and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, or EPAct of 2005. Generally, the FERC’s authority over interstate natural gas transportation extends to:  •rates, operating terms, conditions of service and service contracts;•certification and construction of new facilities; •extension or abandonment of services and facilities or expansion of existing facilities; •maintenance of accounts and records; •acquisition and disposition of facilities;  35•initiation and discontinuation of services;•depreciation and amortization policies; •conduct and relationship with certain affiliates; •market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or natural gas transportation; and •various other matters.  The FERC’s jurisdiction extends to the certification and construction of interstate transportation and storage facilities, including, but not limited to expansions, lateral and other facilities and abandonment of facilities and services. Prior to commencing construction of significant new interstate transportation and storage facilities, an interstate pipeline must obtain a certificate authorizing the construction, or an order amending its existing certificate, from the FERC. Certain minor expansions are authorized by blanket certificates that the FERC has issued by rule. Typically, a significant expansion project requires review by a number of governmental agencies, including state and local agencies, whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule. Any failure by an agency to issue sufficient authorizations or permits in a timely manner for one or more of these projects may mean that Enable will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that Enable did not anticipate. Enable’s inability to obtain sufficient permits and authorizations in a timely manner could materially and negatively impact the additional revenues expected from these projects.  The FERC conducts audits to verify compliance with the FERC’s regulations and the terms of its orders, including whether the websites of interstate pipelines accurately provide information on the operations and availability of services. The FERC’s regulations require uniform terms and conditions for service, as set forth in agreements for transportation and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers. These service agreements are required to conform, in all material respects, with the standard form of service agreements set forth in the pipeline’s FERC-approved tariff. Non-conforming agreements must be filed with, and accepted by, the FERC. In the event that the FERC finds that an agreement, in whole or part, is materially non-conforming, it could reject the agreement or require Enable to seek modification, or alternatively require it to modify its tariff so that the non-conforming provisions are generally available to all customers.  The rates, terms and conditions for transporting natural gas in interstate commerce on certain of Enable’s intrastate pipelines and for services offered at certain of its storage facilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under Section 311 of the NGPA. Rates to provide such interstate transportation service must be “fair and equitable” under the NGPA and are subject to review, refund with interest if found not to be fair and equitable, and approval by the FERC at least once every five years.  Enable’s crude oil gathering pipelines are subject to common carrier regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA. The ICA requires that Enable maintain tariffs on file with the FERC setting forth the rates it charges for providing transportation services, as well as the rules and regulations governing such services. The ICA requires, among other things, that Enable’s rates must be “just and reasonable” and that it provides service in a manner that is nondiscriminatory.  Enable’s operations may also be subject to regulation by state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions. Enable’s pipeline operations that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services. The relevant states in which Enable operates include North Dakota, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Missouri, Kansas, Mississippi, Tennessee and Illinois. State and local regulations generally focus on safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, prohibition of undue discrimination among shippers. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered and, in some instances, adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes. Other state and local regulations also may affect Enable’s business. Any such state or local regulation could have an adverse effect on its business and the results of its operations.  Enable’s gathering lines may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, oil or natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes restrict Enable’s right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport oil or natural gas. Federal law leaves economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states. The states in which 36Enable operates have adopted complaint-based regulation of oil and natural gas gathering activities, which allows oil and natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to access to oil and natural gas gathering pipelines and rate discrimination.  Other state regulations may not directly regulate Enable’s business, but may nonetheless affect the availability of natural gas for processing, including state regulation of production rates and maximum daily production allowable from gas wells. While Enable’s gathering lines are currently subject to limited state regulation, there is a risk that state laws will be changed, which may give producers a stronger basis to challenge the regulatory status of a line, or the rates, terms and conditions of a gathering line providing transportation service.  A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable’s assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.  Enable’s natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA, but FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC’s policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, we cannot assure you that the FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. Although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of Enable’s facilities it considers to be gathering facilities, Enable believe that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of Enable’s gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA and that the facility provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC under the NGA or the NGPA. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect Enable’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions. In addition, if any of Enable’s facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the FERC.  Natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, Enable’s natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enable’s gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on Enable’s operations, but Enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes. Enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.  The DOT has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in “high consequence areas,” which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm. The regulations require operators, including Enable, to, among other things:  •develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment; •identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area; •improve data collection, integration, and analysis; •repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and •implement preventive and mitigating action. 37 Although many of Enable’s pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to these requirements, it may incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair, remediation, preventive or mitigation measures associated with its non-exempt pipelines. Should Enable fail to comply with DOT or comparable state regulations, it could be subject to penalties and fines. Also, the scope of the integrity management program and other related pipeline safety programs could be expanded in the future"
4,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2013-02-27,"Risk Factors
We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by each of these subsidiaries: Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution BusinessA substantial portion of CenterPoint Houston’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.CenterPoint Houston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2012, CenterPoint Houston did business with approximately 75 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and thus remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to the provider of last resort. The Texas Utility Commission revised its regulations in 2009 to (i) increase the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston's billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and affiliates of Energy Future Holdings. CenterPoint Houston's aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2012 was $158 million.  Approximately 42% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG .  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various 17options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations, and claims might be made by creditors involving payments CenterPoint Houston had received from such REP.Rate regulation of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPoint Houston’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CenterPoint Houston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services.CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months.CenterPoint Houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by CenterPoint Houston and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE, a functionally independent division of ERCOT.  Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject CenterPoint Houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.  In addition, if CenterPoint Houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.   The AMS deployed throughout CenterPoint Houston's service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data. CenterPoint Houston has deployed an AMS throughout its service territory.  The deployment consisted, among other elements, of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15-minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to CenterPoint Houston over a bi-directional communications system installed for that purpose.  The AMS integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers' premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer's change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service.  Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the  operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of CenterPoint Houston, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse affect on CenterPoint Houston's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.18Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services BusinessesRate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CERC’s rates for Gas Operations are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions, and for its interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, and its interstate pipelines and field services businesses must compete directly with others in the transportation, storage, gathering, treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to lower prices and reduced volumes, either of which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. They also compete indirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price, but recently, environmental considerations have grown in importance when consumers consider alternative forms of energy. Excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by CERC's interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact CERC's ability to re-contract its available capacity when contracts expire. The actions of CERC’s competitors could lead to lower prices, which may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, any reduction in the volume of natural gas transported or stored may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services businesses are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations and financial condition. CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for Gas Operations, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which CERC operates, thereby resulting in decreased sales and transportation volumes and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements. Changes in geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials affect the value of CERC's transportation and storage services and its ability to re-contract its available capacity when contracts expire. A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.19The revenues and results of operations of CERC’s interstate pipelines and field services businesses are subject to fluctuations in the supply and price of natural gas and natural gas liquids and regulatory and other issues impacting our customers’ production decisions.CERC’s interstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gas sourced in the various supply basins located in the Mid-continent region of the United States. The level of drilling and production activity in these regions is dependent on economic and business factors beyond our control. The primary factor affecting both the level of drilling activity and production volumes is natural gas pricing. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the regions served by our gathering and pipeline transportation systems and our natural gas treating and processing activities. A sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Other factors that impact production decisions include the level of production costs relative to other available production, producers’ access to needed capital and the cost of that capital, access to drilling rigs, the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits and regulatory changes. Regulatory changes include the potential for more restrictive rules governing the use of hydraulic fracturing, a process used in the extraction of natural gas from shale reservoir formations, and the use of water in that process. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves or to shut in production from existing reserves. To the extent the availability of this supply is substantially reduced, it could have an adverse effect on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s revenues from these businesses are also affected by the prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Although the gathering revenues from our field services operations are primarily fee-based, a small portion of these revenues is related to sales of natural gas that we retain from either a usage component of our contracts or from compressor efficiencies, and a reduction in natural gas prices could adversely impact these revenues. NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depend upon factors beyond our control. These factors include supply of and demand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors.CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales and transportation. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.The actual cost of pipelines and gathering systems under construction, future pipeline, gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may be significantly higher than CERC anticipates.Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. have been recently involved in significant pipeline and gathering construction projects and, depending on available opportunities, may, from time to time, be involved in additional significant pipeline construction and gathering and treating system projects in the future. The construction of new pipelines, gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERC’s estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating or compression facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel and nickel, labor shortages or delays, weather delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. As a result, there is the risk that the new facilities may not be able to achieve CERC’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect CERC’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.The states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to which CERC Corp. and its subsidiaries were subject prior to its repeal in 2005, provided a comprehensive regulatory structure governing the organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their member companies. Following repeal of that act, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business that have sought to expand the state regulatory frameworks to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over similar aspects of the utilities that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and 20arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally, they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating. These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionIf we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.As of December 31, 2012, we had $9.8 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $3.8 billion of non-recourse transition and system restoration bonds. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $1.4 billion principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2015. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $1.2 billion on transition and system restoration bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•our exposure to GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn) (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI)), a wholly owned subsidiary of NRG, in connection with certain indemnification obligations;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2012, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $2.4 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, (a) including $290 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements because we are both the obligor on the bonds and the current owner of the bonds, (b) approximately $118 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated and (c) approximately $183 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is obligated. Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $253 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage, including approximately $151 million held in trust to secure certain pollution control bonds for which we are obligated. CenterPoint Houston may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $2.9 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2012. However, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Future Sources and Uses of Cash — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.21As a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our payment obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.We derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.Poor investment performance of the pension plan and factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations.We maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all employees. Our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan, our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities. Funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets, a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability.  In addition to affecting our funding requirements, each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.The use of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries.We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. We and our subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.Risks Common to Our Businesses and Other RisksWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas gathering and processing systems, and electric transmission and distribution systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as: •restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas, or the ability to extract natural gas in areas we serve in our interstate pipelines and field services businesses.22In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to: •construct or acquire new equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations;•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilities.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of NRG; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco) in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn), that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI (now GenOn) were unable to satisfy a liability that has 23been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could be responsible for satisfying the liability.Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary.  When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guaranties RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC’s obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December.  The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $73 million as of December 31, 2012.  Based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2012 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement, GenOn was not obligated to post any security.  As a result, CenterPoint Energy returned to GenOn in the fourth quarter of 2012 the approximately $28 million of aggregate collateral previously posted by GenOn under the agreement.  If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC’s obligations.GenOn's unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade.  If GenOn were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event GenOn might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by GenOn’s creditors might be made against us as its former owner.Reliant Energy and RRI (GenOn’s predecessor) are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets. Although these matters relate to the business and operations of GenOn, claims against Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include liability of Reliant Energy as a controlling shareholder of GenOn’s predecessor. We, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, CenterPoint Houston or CERC and indemnification from GenOn were determined to be unavailable or if GenOn were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claims.In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), Reliant Energy and Texas Genco entered into a separation agreement in which Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint Houston, and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG) were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against, and provided we or Reliant Energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for satisfying the liability.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us. Texas Genco and its related businesses now operate as subsidiaries of NRG.We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries. We anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of NRG, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the NRG affiliate, but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the NRG affiliate.Cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We are subject to cyber-security risks related to breaches in the systems and technology that we use (i) to manage our operations and other business processes and (ii) to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of our businesses.  The operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities, but also on communications among the various components of our system.  As we deploy smart meters and the intelligent grid, 24reliance on communication between and among those components increases.  Similarly, the distribution of natural gas to our customers and the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from our gathering, processing and pipeline facilities, are dependent on communications among our facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas into or receiving natural gas and other products from our facilities.  Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena, by failure of equipment or technology, or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and gas and control these assets.  Cyber-attacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt our operations and critical business functions, adversely affect our reputation, and subject us to possible legal claims and liability, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In addition, our electrical distribution and transmission facilities and gas distribution and pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to conduct our business and have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions. Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including: •operator error or failure of equipment or processes;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes;•information technology system failures; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, pandemic health events or other similar occurrences.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.Our merger and acquisition activities may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated.From time to time, we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and assets.  However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable.  In addition, any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following: •acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;•acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate; •we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us, that exceed our estimates, or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited; •we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and •acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt our ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures.    Failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations. Our business is dependent on our ability to recruit, retain, and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs, or the unavailability of contract 25resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Our costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, our results of operations could be negatively affected.The unsettled conditions in the global financial system may have impacts on our business, liquidity and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.The continued unsettled conditions in the global financial system may have an impact on our business, liquidity and financial condition. Our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our liquidity and flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equity financing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions. Defaults of lenders in our credit facilities, should they occur, could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition to the credit and financial market issues, a recurrence of national and local recessionary conditions may impact our business in a variety of ways. These include, among other things, reduced customer usage, increased customer default rates and wide swings in commodity prices.Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.The United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar in 2012.  Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. In addition, the EPA expanded its existing GHG emissions reporting requirements to include upstream petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per year.  These permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of GHGs by the EPA.  As a distributor and transporter of natural gas and consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Nevertheless, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted"
2,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2012-02-29,"Risk Factors
We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by each of these subsidiaries: Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution BusinessA substantial portion of CenterPoint Houston’s receivables is concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.CenterPoint Houston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2011, CenterPoint Houston did business with 86 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and thus remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to the provider of last resort. The Texas Utility Commission revised its regulations in 2009 to (i) increase the financial qualifications required of REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston's billed receivables from REPs are from affiliates of NRG and affiliates of Energy Future Holdings. CenterPoint Houston's aggregate billed receivables balance from REPs as of December 31, 2011 was $163 million.  Approximately 39% and 11% of this amount was owed by affiliates of NRG and Energy Future Holdings, respectively.  Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments CenterPoint Houston had received from such REP.Rate regulation of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPoint Houston’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CenterPoint Houston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an analysis 17of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services.CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months.CenterPoint Houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standards.The FERC has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service, including transmission facilities owned by CenterPoint Houston and other utilities within ERCOT. The FERC has designated the NERC as the ERO to promulgate standards, under FERC oversight, for all owners, operators and users of the bulk power system. The FERC has approved the delegation by the NERC of authority for reliability in ERCOT to the TRE, a functionally independent division of ERCOT.  Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject CenterPoint Houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures.  In addition, if CenterPoint Houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards, it could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.   The AMS being deployed throughout CenterPoint Houston's service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data. CenterPoint Houston is deploying an AMS throughout its service territory with completion of deployment of advanced meters expected to occur in 2012.  The deployment consists, among other elements, of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that will record metering data at 15-minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to CenterPoint Houston over a bi-directional communications system being installed for that purpose.  The AMS integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers' premises, such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customer's change in REPs or the connection or disconnection of electric service.  Unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the installation and operation of the AMS, including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software, difficulties in integrating the various components of the AMS, insufficient staff or training to implement the AMS, changes in technology, cyber-security issues and factors outside the control of CenterPoint Houston, which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges, which could have a material adverse affect on CenterPoint Houston's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services BusinessesRate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CERC’s rates for Gas Operations are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions, and for its interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. 18CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, and its interstate pipelines and field services businesses must compete directly with others in the transportation, storage, gathering, treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to lower prices and reduced volumes, either of which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. They also compete indirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price, but recently, environmental considerations have grown in importance when consumers consider alternative forms of energy. The actions of CERC’s competitors could lead to lower prices, which may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, any reduction in the volume of natural gas transported or stored may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services businesses are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations and financial condition. CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for Gas Operations, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which CERC operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and transportation volumes and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels. Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements. Changes in geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials affect the value of our transportation and storage services and our ability to re-contract our available capacity when contracts expire. A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.The revenues and results of operations of CERC’s interstate pipelines and field services businesses are subject to fluctuations in the supply and price of natural gas and natural gas liquids and regulatory and other issues impacting our customers’ production decisions.CERC’s interstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gas sourced in the various supply basins located in the Mid-continent region of the United States. The level of drilling and production activity in these regions is dependent on economic and business factors beyond our control. The primary factor affecting both the level of drilling activity and production volumes is natural gas pricing. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the regions served by our gathering and pipeline transportation systems and our natural gas treating and processing activities. A sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Other factors that impact production decisions include the level of production costs relative to other available production, producers’ access to needed capital and the cost of that capital, access to drilling rigs, the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits and regulatory changes. Regulatory changes include the potential for more restrictive rules governing the use of hydraulic fracturing, a process used in the extraction of natural gas from shale reservoir formations, and the use of groundwater in that process. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by our assets, producers may 19choose not to develop those reserves or to shut in production from existing reserves. To the extent the availability of this supply is substantially reduced, it could have an adverse effect on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s revenues from these businesses are also affected by the prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). Although the gathering revenues from our field services operations are primarily fee-based, a small portion of these revenues is related to sales of natural gas that we retain from either a usage component of our contracts or from compressor efficiencies, and a reduction in natural gas prices could adversely impact these revenues. NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depend upon factors beyond our control. These factors include supply of and demand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors.CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales and transportation. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.The actual cost of pipelines and gathering systems under construction, future pipeline, gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may be significantly higher than CERC anticipates.Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. have been recently involved in significant pipeline and gathering construction projects and, depending on available opportunities, may, from time to time, be involved in additional significant pipeline construction and gathering and treating system projects in the future. The construction of new pipelines, gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERC’s estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating or compression facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel and nickel, labor shortages or delays, weather delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. As a result, there is the risk that the new facilities may not be able to achieve CERC’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect CERC’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.The states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to which we and our subsidiaries were subject prior to its repeal in 2005, provided a comprehensive regulatory structure governing the organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their member companies. Following repeal of that act, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business that have sought to expand the state regulatory frameworks to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over similar aspects of the utilities that operate in those states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally they may impose record-keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s credit rating. These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionIf we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.As of December 31, 2011, we had $9.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $2.5 billion of non-recourse transition and system restoration bonds. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $1.8 billion principal amount 20of this debt is required to be paid through 2014. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately $872 million on transition and system restoration bonds, for which dedicated revenue streams exist, but includes $275 million of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf that we purchased in February 2012 (and that may be remarketed) and $100 million of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf that have been called for redemption in March 2012. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:•general economic and capital market conditions;•credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;•investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;•maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;•market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;•market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;•our exposure to GenOn Energy, Inc. (GenOn) (formerly known as RRI Energy, Inc., Reliant Energy, Inc. and Reliant Resources, Inc. (RRI)) in connection with certain indemnification obligations;•incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and•provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2011, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, (a) including $290 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected on our consolidated financial statements because we are both the obligor on the bonds and the owner of the bonds, (b)  approximately $218 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated of which $100 million secures bonds that have been called for redemption in March 2012 and (c) approximately $229 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is obligated. Additionally, as of December 31, 2011, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $253 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage, including approximately $151 million held in trust to secure certain pollution control bonds for which we are obligated. CenterPoint Houston may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $2.5 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2011. However, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Future Sources and Uses of Cash — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.As a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our payment obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.We derive all of our operating income from, and hold all of our assets through, our subsidiaries. As a result, we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any 21indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.The use of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries.We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. We and our subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.Risks Common to Our Businesses and Other RisksWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas gathering and processing systems, and electric transmission and distribution systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as: •restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;•limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;•requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;•enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and•impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas, or the ability to extract natural gas in areas we serve in our interstate pipelines and field services businesses.In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to: •construct or acquire new equipment;•acquire permits for facility operations;•modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and•clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilities.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.The recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipate.22Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through subsidiaries and include:•merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001; and•Texas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco) in 2002, later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of NRG.In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI (now GenOn), that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI (now GenOn) were unable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could be responsible for satisfying the liability.Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary.  When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guaranties RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC’s obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December.  The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $88 million as of December 31, 2011.  Market conditions in the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2011 required posting of security under the agreement, and GenOn posted approximately $7 million in collateral in December 2010 and an additional $21 million of collateral in December 2011.  If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC’s obligations.GenOn's unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade.  If GenOn were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event GenOn might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by GenOn’s creditors might be made against us as its former owner.Reliant Energy and RRI (GenOn’s predecessor) are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets. Although these matters relate to the business and operations of GenOn, claims against Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include liability of Reliant Energy as a controlling shareholder of GenOn’s predecessor. 23We, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, CenterPoint Houston or CERC and indemnification from GenOn were determined to be unavailable or if GenOn were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claims.In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG), Reliant Energy and Texas Genco entered into a separation agreement in which Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint Houston, and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If Texas Genco (now an affiliate of NRG) were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against, and provided we or Reliant Energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for satisfying the liability.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us. Texas Genco and its related businesses now operate as subsidiaries of NRG.We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries. We anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of NRG, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the NRG affiliate, but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the NRG affiliate.Cyber-attacks, acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We are subject to cyber-security risks related to breaches in the systems and technology that we use (i) to manage our operations and other business processes and (ii) to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of our businesses.  The operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities, but also on communications among the various components of our system.  As we deploy smart meters and the intelligent grid, reliance on communication between and among those components increases.  Similarly, the distribution of natural gas to our customers and the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas from our gathering, processing and pipeline facilities, are dependent on communications among our facilities and with third-party systems that may be delivering natural gas into or receiving natural gas and other products from our facilities.  Disruption of those communications, whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena, by failure of equipment or technology, or by manmade events, such as cyber-attacks or acts of terrorism, may disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and gas and control these assets.  Cyber-attacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt our operations and critical business functions, adversely affect our reputation, and subject us to possible legal claims and liability, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  In addition, our electrical distribution and transmission facilities and gas distribution and pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to conduct our business and have a material adverse affect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain corporate functions. Our performance depends on the successful operation of our facilities. Operating these facilities involves many risks, including: •operator error or failure of equipment or processes;•operating limitations that may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements;•labor disputes;24•information technology system failures; and•catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, droughts, hurricanes, pandemic health events, or other similar occurrences.Such events may result in a decrease or elimination of revenue from our facilities, an increase in the cost of operating our facilities or delays in cash collections, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.The unsettled conditions in the global financial system may have impacts on our business, liquidity and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.The continued unsettled conditions in the global financial system may have an impact on our business, liquidity and financial condition. Our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our liquidity and flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equity financing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions. Defaults of lenders in our credit facilities, should they occur, could adversely affect our liquidity. Capital market turmoil was reflected in significant reductions in equity market valuations in 2008, which significantly reduced the value of assets of our pension plan. These reductions increased non-cash pension expense in 2009 and may impact liquidity if contributions are made to offset reduced asset values.In addition to the credit and financial market issues, a recurrence of national and local recessionary conditions may impact our business in a variety of ways. These include, among other things, reduced customer usage, increased customer default rates and wide swings in commodity prices.Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.The United States Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa in 2011.  Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources. The results of the permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of these GHGs by the EPA.  Action by the EPA to impose new regulations and standards regarding GHG emissions is underway and has resulted in new regulatory reporting requirements.  As a distributor and transporter of natural gas and consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Nevertheless, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could result in more frequent severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses.To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting 25from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted"
11,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2011-03-01,">Item 1A.     Risk Factors
We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. The following, along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by each of these subsidiaries: Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Electric Transmission & Distribution BusinessFollowing the exhaustion of all judicial appeals in its true-up proceeding, CenterPoint Houston may lose certain tax benefits and/or may not recover the full amount of its true-up request.  Such a result could have an adverse impact on CenterPoint Houston’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its true-up application with the Texas Utility Commission, requesting recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as allowed under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004, the Texas Utility Commission issued its True-Up Order allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a true-up balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included interest through August 31, 2004, and provided for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery, along with the principal portion of additional EMCs returned to customers after August 31, 2004 and certain other adjustments.CenterPoint Houston and other parties filed appeals of the True-Up Order to a district court in Travis County, Texas. In August 2005, that court issued its judgment on the various appeals. In its judgment, the district court:  •reversed the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that had denied CenterPoint Houston recovery of a portion of the capacity auction true-up amounts;  •reversed the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that precluded CenterPoint Houston from recovering the interest component of the EMCs paid to REPs; and  •affirmed the True-Up Order in all other respects.The district court’s decision would have had the effect of restoring approximately $650 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the Texas Utility Commission had disallowed from CenterPoint Houston’s initial request.CenterPoint Houston and other parties appealed the district court’s judgment to the Texas Third Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in December 2007. In its decision, the court of appeals:  •reversed the district court’s judgment to the extent it restored the capacity auction true-up amounts;  •reversed the district court’s judgment to the extent it upheld the Texas Utility Commission’s decision to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover EMCs paid to RRI;   25    •ordered that the tax normalization issue described below be remanded to the Texas Utility Commission as requested by the Texas Utility Commission; and  •affirmed the district court’s judgment in all other respects.In April 2008, the court of appeals denied all motions for rehearing and reissued substantially the same opinion as it had rendered in December 2007.In June 2008, CenterPoint Houston petitioned the Texas Supreme Court for review of the court of appeals decision. In its petition, CenterPoint Houston seeks reversal of the parts of the court of appeals decision that (i) denied recovery of EMCs paid to RRI, (ii) denied recovery of the capacity auction true-up amounts allowed by the district court, (iii) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’s rulings that denied recovery of approximately $378 million related to depreciation and (iv) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’s refusal to permit CenterPoint Houston to utilize the partial stock valuation methodology for determining the market value of its former generation assets. Two other petitions for review were filed with the Texas Supreme Court by other parties to the appeal. In those petitions parties contend that (i) the Texas Utility Commission was without authority to fashion the methodology it used for valuing the former generation assets after it had determined that CenterPoint Houston could not use the partial stock valuation method, (ii) in fashioning the method it used for valuing the former generating assets, the Texas Utility Commission deprived parties of their due process rights and an opportunity to be heard, (iii) the net book value of the generating assets should have been adjusted downward due to the impact of a purchase option that had been granted to RRI, (iv) CenterPoint Houston should not have been permitted to recover construction work in progress balances without proving those amounts in the manner required by law and (v) the Texas Utility Commission was without authority to award interest on the capacity auction true up award.In June 2009, the Texas Supreme Court granted the petitions for review of the court of appeals decision.  Oral argument before the court was held in October 2009.To reflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005, we recorded a net after-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to the district court’s judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if the court of appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of further review by the Texas Supreme Court, we anticipate that we would be required to record an additional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision. The amount of that loss would depend on several factors, including ultimate resolution of the tax normalization issue described below, but could range from $190 million to $440 million (pre-tax) plus interest subsequent to December 31, 2010.In the True-Up Order, the Texas Utility Commission reduced CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost recovery by approximately $146 million, which was included in the extraordinary loss discussed above, to reflect the present value of certain deferred tax benefits associated with its former electric generation assets. We believe that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposed regulations issued by the IRS in March 2003 that would have allowed utilities owning assets that were deregulated before March 4, 2003 to make a retroactive election to pass the benefits of ADITC and EDFIT back to customers. However, the IRS subsequently withdrew those proposed normalization regulations and, in March 2008, adopted final regulations that would not permit utilities like CenterPoint Houston to pass the tax benefits back to customers without creating normalization violations. In addition, we received a PLR from the IRS in August 2007, prior to adoption of the final regulations, that confirmed that the Texas Utility Commission’s order reducing CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost recovery by $146 million for ADITC and EDFIT would cause normalization violations with respect to the ADITC and EDFIT.If the Texas Utility Commission’s order relating to the ADITC reduction is not reversed or otherwise modified on remand so as to eliminate the normalization violation, the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to CenterPoint Houston’s unamortized ADITC balance as of the date that the normalization violation is deemed to have occurred. In addition, the IRS could deny CenterPoint Houston the ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation benefits beginning in the taxable year that the normalization violation is deemed to have occurred. Such treatment, if required by the IRS, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in addition to any potential loss resulting from final resolution of the True-Up Order. Following the adoption by the IRS of the final regulations described above, the Texas Utility Commission requested, and the court of appeals ordered, that this issue be remanded to that commission for further consideration. No party has challenged    26   that order by the court of appeals although the Texas Supreme Court has the authority to consider all aspects of the rulings above, not just those challenged specifically by the appellants. We and CenterPoint Houston will continue to pursue a favorable resolution of this issue through the appellate and administrative process. Although the Texas Utility Commission has requested that this issue be remanded to it by the courts and has not previously required a company subject to its jurisdiction to take action that would result in a normalization violation, no prediction can be made as to the ultimate action the Texas Utility Commission may take on this issue on remand. CenterPoint Houston’s receivables are concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.CenterPoint Houston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. As of December 31, 2010, CenterPoint Houston did business with 99 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the ability of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services or could cause them to delay such payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and thus remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to the provider of last resort. The Texas Utility Commission revised its regulations in 2009 to (i) increase the financial qualifications from REPs that began selling power after January 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case. A subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc., NRG Retail, (which acquired the Texas retail business of RRI) and its subsidiaries are together considered the largest REP in CenterPoint Houston’s service territory. Approximately 33% of CenterPoint Houston’s $138 million in billed receivables from REPs at December 31, 2010 was owed by subsidiaries of NRG Retail and approximately 13% of the $138 million in billed receivables was owed by subsidiaries of TXU Energy Retail. Any delay or default in payment by REPs could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If a REP were unable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event such REP might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments CenterPoint Houston had received from such REP.Rate regulation of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPoint Houston’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CenterPoint Houston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.Disruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services.CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate, CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, with revenues being higher during the warmer months.   27   Risk Factors
 Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services BusinessesRate regulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CERC’s rates for Gas Operations are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions, and for its interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. CERC’s businesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, and its interstate pipelines and field services businesses must compete directly with others in the transportation, storage, gathering, treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to lower prices and reduced volumes, either of which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in the transportation and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. They also compete indirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price, but recently, environmental considerations have grown in importance when consumers consider alternative forms of energy. The actions of CERC’s competitors could lead to lower prices, which may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, any reduction in the volume of natural gas transported or stored may have an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services businesses are subject to fluctuations in natural gas prices, which could affect the ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations.CERC is subject to risk associated with changes in the price of natural gas. Increases in natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due from its customers and, for Gas Operations, could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could (i) apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which CERC operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and transportation volumes and revenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increase CERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels.  Additionally, a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that CERC must provide under its hedging arrangements.A decline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas.If CERC’s credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capital requirements or    28   otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. The revenues and results of operations of CERC’s interstate pipelines and field services businesses are subject to fluctuations in the supply and price of natural gas and natural gas liquids and regulatory and other issues impacting our customers’ production decisions.CERC’s interstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gas sourced in the various supply basins located in the Mid-continent region of the United States. The level of drilling and production activity in these regions is dependent on economic and business factors beyond our control. The primary factor affecting both the level of drilling activity and production volumes is natural gas pricing. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the regions served by our gathering and pipeline transportation systems and our natural gas treating and processing activities. A sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Other factors that impact production decisions include the level of production costs relative to other available production, producers’ access to needed capital and the cost of that capital, access to drilling rigs, the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits and regulatory changes. Regulatory changes include the potential for more restrictive rules governing the use of hydraulic fracturing, a process used in the extraction of natural gas from shale reservoir formations, and the use of groundwater in that process. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves or to shut in production from existing reserves. To the extent the availability of this supply is substantially reduced, it could have an adverse effect on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s revenues from these businesses are also affected by the prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and we expect this volatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depend upon factors beyond our control. These factors include supply of and demand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors.CERC’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.A substantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales and transportation. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues being higher during the winter months.The actual cost of pipelines and gathering systems under construction, future pipeline, gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may be significantly higher than CERC had planned.Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. have been recently involved in significant pipeline and gathering construction projects and, depending on available opportunities, may, from time to time, be involved in additional significant pipeline construction and gathering and treating system projects in the future. The construction of new pipelines, gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERC’s estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating or compression facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment and materials such as steel and nickel, labor shortages or delays, weather delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. As a result, there is the risk that the new facilities may not be able to achieve CERC’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect CERC’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.   29   The states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions similar to or broader than those under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 regarding organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to which we and our subsidiaries were subject prior to its repeal in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, provided a comprehensive regulatory structure governing the organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their member companies. Following repeal of that Act, proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which CERC does business that have sought to expand the state regulatory frameworks to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over similar aspects of the utilities that operate in their states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure. Additionally they may impose record keeping, record access, employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utility’s bond rating. These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conduct its utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements.Risk Factors
 Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionIf we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limited.As of December 31, 2010, we had $9.5 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes $2.8 billion of non-recourse transition and system restoration bonds. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $1.1 billion principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2013. This amount excludes (i) $550 million principal amount of CERC Corp. senior notes that were repaid at their maturity in February 2011 with proceeds from the issuance in January 2011 of $550 million principal amount of CERC Corp. senior notes maturing subsequent to 2013, (ii) $397 million principal amount of CERC Corp. 7.875% senior notes due 2013 that were exchanged in January 2011 for CERC Corp. senior notes maturing subsequent to 2013 and (iii) principal repayments of approximately $920 million on transition and system restoration bonds, for which a dedicated revenue stream exists. Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among other things:  •the resolution of the true-up proceedings, including, in particular, the results of appeals to the Texas Supreme Court regarding rulings obtained to date;  •general economic and capital market conditions;  •credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;  •investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;  •maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;  •market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;  •market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms;  •our exposure to GenOn in connection with its indemnification obligations arising in connection with its separation from us;   30     •incremental collateral that may be required due to regulation of derivatives; and   •provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.As of December 31, 2010, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds outstanding under the General Mortgage, (a) including $290 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds that are not reflected on our consolidated financial statements because we are both the obligor on the bonds and the owner of the bonds, (b) an additional approximately $237 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which we are obligated and (c) approximately $229 million held in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is obligated. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston had approximately $253 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds outstanding under the Mortgage, including approximately $151 million held in trust to secure certain pollution control bonds for which we are obligated. CenterPoint Houston may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $2.3 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2010. However, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions. Our current credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Future Sources and Uses of Cash — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.As a holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our payment obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributions.We derive all our operating income from, and hold all our assets through, our subsidiaries. As a result, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions.Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.The use of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries.We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. We and our subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.  31   Risks Common to Our Businesses and Other RisksWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas gathering and processing systems, and electric transmission and distribution systems, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:   •restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;   •limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;   •requiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations, or attributable to former operations;   •enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations; and   •impacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas, or the ability to extract natural gas in areas we serve in our interstate pipelines and field services businesses. In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:   •construct or acquire new equipment;   •acquire permits for facility operations;   •modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and   •clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment.Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   32   In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system, other than substations, because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to others.Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through subsidiaries and include:  •merchant energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public offering in 2001; and   •Texas electric generating facilities transferred to Texas Genco Holdings, Inc. (Texas Genco) in 2004 and early 2005. In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI, that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If GenOn were unable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could be responsible for satisfying the liability.In May 2009, RRI sold its Texas retail business to NRG Retail, a subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc. In December 2010, Mirant Corporation merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of RRI (then known as RRI Energy, Inc.) and RRI changed its name from RRI Energy, Inc. to GenOn Energy, Inc. Neither the sale of the retail business nor the merger with Mirant Corporation alters GenOn’s contractual obligations to indemnify us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, for certain liabilities, including their indemnification obligations regarding certain litigation, nor does it affect the terms of existing guaranty arrangements for certain GenOn gas transportation contracts.Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s trading subsidiary.  When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC against obligations under the guaranties RRI had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation.  Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI (now GenOn) agreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security against CERC’s obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation, with any required collateral to be posted each December.  The undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will be in effect until 2018, was approximately $112 million as of December 31, 2010.  Market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2010 required posting of security under the agreement, and GenOn posted approximately $7 million in collateral in December 2010. If GenOn should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERC could have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy CERC’s obligations.   33   GenOn’s unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade. If GenOn were unable to meet its obligations, it would need to consider, among various options, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event GenOn might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by GenOn’s creditors might be made against us as its former owner.Reliant Energy and RRI (GenOn’s predecessors) are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in California and other markets. Although these matters relate to the business and operations of GenOn, claims against Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include liability of Reliant Energy as a controlling shareholder of GenOn’s predecessor. We, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us, CenterPoint Houston or CERC and indemnification from GenOn were determined to be unavailable or if GenOn were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claims.In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco, Reliant Energy and Texas Genco entered into a separation agreement in which Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint Houston, and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If Texas Genco were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against, and provided we or Reliant Energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for satisfying the liability.In connection with our sale of Texas Genco to a third party, the separation agreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for, and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us. Texas Genco and its related businesses now operate as subsidiaries of NRG Energy, Inc.We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries but currently owned by NRG Texas LP. We anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and its sale to NRG Texas LP, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by NRG Texas LP, but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by NRG Texas LP.The unsettled conditions in the global financial system may have impacts on our business, liquidity and financial condition that we currently cannot predict.The continued unsettled conditions in the global financial system may have an impact on our business, liquidity and financial condition. Our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact on our liquidity and flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equity financing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions. Defaults of lenders in our credit facilities, should they further occur, could adversely affect our liquidity. Capital market turmoil was reflected in significant reductions in equity market valuations in 2008, which significantly reduced the value of assets of our pension plan. These reductions increased non-cash pension expense in 2009 and may impact liquidity if contributions are made to offset reduced asset values.In addition to the credit and financial market issues, national and local recessionary conditions may impact our business in a variety of ways. These include, among other things, reduced customer usage, increased customer default rates and wide swings in commodity prices.   34   Climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.Legislation to regulate emissions of GHGs has been introduced in Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation.  In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009. Also, the EPA has undertaken new efforts to collect information regarding GHG emissions and their effects. Following a finding by the EPA that certain GHGs represent an endangerment to human health, the EPA proposed to expand its regulations relating to those emissions and has adopted rules imposing permitting and reporting obligations that we expect to be applicable to certain of our operations. The results of the permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of these GHGs by the EPA  It is too early to determine whether, or in what form, further regulatory action regarding GHG emissions will be adopted or what specific impacts a new regulatory action might have on us and our subsidiaries. Action by the EPA to impose new regulations and standards regarding GHG emissions is underway and appears likely to result in new standards and regulatory requirements.  As a distributor and transporter of natural gas and consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses, CERC’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Our electric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electric utilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity.  Nevertheless, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services.Climate changes could result in more frequent severe weather events which could affect the results of operations of our businesses.To the extent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories, financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales, and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes or tornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near the Gulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes can increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted"
10,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2010-02-26,">Item 1A.          Risk Factors
We are aholding company that conducts all of our business operations throughsubsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. The following, along withany additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference inItem 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associatedwith the businesses conducted by each of these subsidiaries: 23Table of ContentsRiskFactors Affecting Our Electric Transmission & DistributionBusinessCenterPointHouston may not be successful in ultimately recovering the full value of itstrue-up components, which could result in the elimination of certain taxbenefits and could have an adverse impact on CenterPoint Houston’s results ofoperations, financial condition and cash flows.In March2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its true-up application with the Texas UtilityCommission, requesting recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, asallowed under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004, the TexasUtility Commission issued its True-Up Order allowing CenterPoint Houston torecover a true-up balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which includedinterest through August 31, 2004, and provided for adjustment of the amountto be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery, along withthe principal portion of additional EMCs returned to customers afterAugust 31, 2004 and certain other adjustments.CenterPointHouston and other parties filed appeals of the True-Up Order to a district courtin Travis County, Texas. In August 2005, that court issued its judgment on thevarious appeals. In its judgment, the district court:       •reversed      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that had denied recovery of a      portion of the capacity auction true-upamounts;       •reversed      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that precluded CenterPoint Houston      from recovering the interest component of the EMCs paid to REPs;      and       •affirmed      the True-Up Order in all otherrespects.Thedistrict court’s decision would have had the effect of restoring approximately$650 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the Texas UtilityCommission had disallowed from CenterPoint Houston’s initialrequest.CenterPointHouston and other parties appealed the district court’s judgment to the TexasThird Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in December 2007. In itsdecision, the court of appeals:       •reversed      the district court’s judgment to the extent it restored the capacity      auction true-up amounts;       •reversed      the district court’s judgment to the extent it upheld the Texas Utility      Commission’s decision to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover EMCs paid to      RRI;       •ordered      that the tax normalization issue described below be remanded to the Texas      Utility Commission as requested by the Texas Utility Commission;      and        •affirmed      the district court’s judgment in all other  respects.In April2008, the court of appeals denied all motions for rehearing and reissuedsubstantially the same opinion as it had rendered in December 2007.In June2008, CenterPoint Houston petitioned the Texas Supreme Court for review of thecourt of appeals decision. In its petition, CenterPoint Houston seeks reversalof the parts of the court of appeals decision that (i) denied recovery of EMCspaid to RRI, (ii) denied recovery of the capacity auction true-up amountsallowed by the district court, (iii) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’srulings that denied recovery of approximately $378 million related todepreciation and (iv) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’s refusal to permitCenterPoint Houston to utilize the partial stock valuation methodology fordetermining the market value of its former generation assets. Two otherpetitions for review were filed with the Texas Supreme Court by other parties tothe appeal. In those petitions parties contend that (i) the Texas UtilityCommission was without authority to fashion the methodology it used for valuingthe former generation assets after it had determined that CenterPoint Houstoncould not use the partial stock valuation method, (ii) in fashioning the methodit used for valuing the former generating assets, the Texas Utility Commissiondeprived parties of their due process rights and an opportunity to be heard,(iii) the net book value of the generating assets should have been adjusteddownward due to the impact of a purchase option that had been granted to RRI,(iv) CenterPoint Houston should not have been permitted to recover  24Table of Contents constructionwork in progress balances without proving those amounts in the manner requiredby law and (v) the Texas Utility Commission was without authority to awardinterest on the capacity auction true up award.In June2009, the Texas Supreme Court granted the petitions for review of the court ofappeals decision.  Oral argument before the court was held in October2009.  Although we and CenterPoint Houston believe that CenterPointHouston’s true-up request is consistent with applicable statutes and regulationsand, accordingly, that it is reasonably possible that it will be successful inits appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, we can provide no assurance as to theultimate court rulings on the issues to be considered in the appeal or withrespect to the ultimate decision by the Texas Utility Commission on the taxnormalization issue described below.Toreflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005, we recorded a netafter-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to thedistrict court’s judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have beenrecorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if the court ofappeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of further review bythe Texas Supreme Court, we anticipate that we would be required to record anadditional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision. The amount of thatloss would depend on several factors, including ultimate resolution of the taxnormalization issue described below and the calculation of interest on anyamounts CenterPoint Houston ultimately is authorized to recover or is requiredto refund beyond the amounts recorded based on the True-Up Order, but couldrange from $180 million to $410 million (pre-tax) plus interestsubsequent to December 31, 2009.In theTrue-Up Order, the Texas Utility Commission reduced CenterPoint Houston’sstranded cost recovery by approximately $146 million, which was included inthe extraordinary loss discussed above, for the present value of certaindeferred tax benefits associated with its former electric generation assets. Webelieve that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposedregulations issued by the IRS in March 2003 that would have allowed utilitiesowning assets that were deregulated before March 4, 2003 to make aretroactive election to pass the benefits of ADITC and EDFIT back to customers.However, the IRS subsequently withdrew those proposed normalization regulationsand, in March 2008, adopted final regulations that would not permit utilitieslike CenterPoint Houston to pass the tax benefits back to customers withoutcreating normalization violations. In addition, we received a PLR from the IRSin August 2007, prior to adoption of the final regulations, that confirmed thatthe Texas Utility Commission’s order reducing CenterPoint Houston’s strandedcost recovery by $146 million for ADITC and EDFIT would cause normalizationviolations with respect to the ADITC and EDFIT.If theTexas Utility Commission’s order relating to the ADITC reduction is not reversedor otherwise modified on remand so as to eliminate the normalization violation,the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to CenterPoint Houston’sunamortized ADITC balance as of the date that the normalization violation isdeemed to have occurred. In addition, the IRS could deny CenterPoint Houston theability to elect accelerated tax depreciation benefits beginning in the taxableyear that the normalization violation is deemed to have occurred. Suchtreatment, if required by the IRS, could have a material adverse impact on ourresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows in addition to anypotential loss resulting from final resolution of the True-Up Order. In itsopinion, the court of appeals ordered that this issue be remanded to the TexasUtility Commission, as that commission requested. No party has challenged thatorder by the court of appeals although the Texas Supreme Court has the authorityto consider all aspects of the rulings above, not just those challengedspecifically by the appellants. We and CenterPoint Houston will continue topursue a favorable resolution of this issue through the appellate andadministrative process. Although the Texas Utility Commission has not previouslyrequired a company subject to its jurisdiction to take action that would resultin a normalization violation, no prediction can be made as to the ultimateaction the Texas Utility Commission may take on this issue onremand.CenterPointHouston’s receivables are concentrated in a small number of REPs, and any delayor default in payment could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows,financial condition and results of operations.CenterPointHouston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected fromREPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to theircustomers. As of December 31, 2009, CenterPoint Houston did business withapproximately 80 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in themarket served by ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs couldimpair the ability of these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services orcould cause them to delay such payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on theseREPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisionsrequire that customers be shifted to a provider of  25Table of Contents lastresort if a REP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commissionregulations significantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston canapply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firmsdesiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory, and thusremains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to the provider of lastresort. Although the Texas Utility Commission revised its regulations in 2009 to(i) increase the financial qualifications from REPs that began selling powerafter January 1, 2009, and (ii) authorize utilities to defer bad debts resultingfrom defaults by REPs for recovery in a future rate case, significant bad debtsmay be realized and unpaid amounts may not be timely recovered. A subsidiary ofNRG Energy, Inc., NRG Retail LLC, acquired the Texas retail business of RRI, andits subsidiaries are together considered the largest REP in CenterPointHouston’s service territory. Approximately 41% of CenterPoint Houston’s$139 million in billed receivables from REPs at December 31, 2009 was owedby subsidiaries of NRG Retail LLC. NRG Energy, Inc.’s credit ratings arecurrently below investment grade.  Any delay or default in payment byREPs could adversely affect CenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financialcondition and results of operations.  If any of these REPs were unableto meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options, restructuringunder the bankruptcy laws, in which event any such REP might seek to avoidhonoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involvingpayments CenterPoint Houston had received from such REP.Rateregulation of CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPointHouston’s ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover itscosts.CenterPointHouston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas UtilityCommission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in atest year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may notmatch its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process by which rates aredetermined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery ofCenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonablereturn on its invested capital.In thisregard, pursuant to the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement approved by theTexas Utility Commission in September 2006, until June 30, 2010 CenterPointHouston is limited in its ability to request retail rate relief. For moreinformation on the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, please read ""Business -Regulation - State and Local Regulation - Electric Transmission &Distribution - CenterPoint Houston Rate Agreement"" in Item 1 of this Form10-K.Disruptionsat power generation facilities owned by third parties could interruptCenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distributionservices.CenterPointHouston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that theREPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPointHouston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If powergeneration is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate,CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may bediminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial conditionand cash flows could be adversely affected.CenterPointHouston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.Asignificant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates thatit collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers onbehalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results ofoperations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes inelectricity usage, with revenues being higher during the warmermonths.RiskFactors Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive Natural Gas Salesand Services, Interstate Pipelines and Field Services BusinessesRateregulation of CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn areasonable return and fully recover its costs.CERC’srates for Gas Operations are regulated by certain municipalities and statecommissions, and for its interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysisof its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates thatCERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. Theregulatory process in which  26Table of Contents rates aredetermined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery ofCERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn a reasonable return on its investedcapital.CERC’sbusinesses must compete with alternate energy sources, which could result inCERC marketing less natural gas, and its interstate pipelines and field servicesbusinesses must compete directly with others in the transportation, storage,gathering, treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to lowerprices and reduced volumes, either of which could have an adverse impact onCERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERCcompetes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and otherfuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gasdistributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas salesto end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affectinginterstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may beable to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gasdirectly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount ofnatural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition mayhave an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition andcash flows.CERC’stwo interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete with other interstateand intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in the transportation and storageof natural gas. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms ofservice, and flexibility and reliability of service. They also competeindirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coal and fueloils. The primary competitive factor is price. The actions of CERC’s competitorscould lead to lower prices, which may have an adverse impact on CERC’s resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, any reductionin the volume of natural gas transported or stored may have an adverse impact onCERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’snatural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and servicesbusinesses are subject to fluctuations in natural gas prices, which could affectthe ability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations orotherwise adversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results ofoperations.CERC issubject to risk associated with changes in the price of natural gas. Increasesin natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due fromits customers and, for Gas Operations, could create the potential foruncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built intoCERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas pricescould (i) apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areasin which CERC operates thereby resulting in decreased sales volumes and revenuesand (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers fail or are unableto meet their obligations. An increase in natural gas prices would also increaseCERC’s working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must bemade in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels.  Additionally,a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral thatCERC must provide under its hedging arrangements.Adecline in CERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to providecollateral in order to purchase natural gas or under its shipping or hedgingarrangements.If CERC’scredit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral inorder to purchase natural gas or under its shipping or hedging arrangements. Ifa credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were tooccur at a time when CERC was experiencing significant working capitalrequirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’s results of operations,financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.Therevenues and results of operations of CERC’s interstate pipelines and fieldservices businesses are subject to fluctuations in the supply and price ofnatural gas and natural gas liquids.CERC’sinterstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gassourced in the various supply basins located in the Mid-continent region of theUnited States. The level of drilling and production activity in these regions isdependent on economic and business factors beyond our control. The primaryfactor affecting both the level of drilling activity and production volumes isnatural gas pricing. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in adecrease in exploration and development activities in the regions served by ourgathering and  27Table of Contents pipelinetransportation systems and our natural gas treating and processing activities. Asustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from theirexisting wells. Other factors that impact production decisions include the levelof production costs relative to other available production, producers’ access toneeded capital and the cost of that capital, the ability of producers to obtainnecessary drilling and other governmental permits, access to drilling rigs andregulatory changes. Because of these factors, even if new natural gas reservesare discovered in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not todevelop those reserves or to shut in production from existing reserves. To theextent the availability of this supply is substantially reduced, it could havean adverse effect on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cashflows.CERC’srevenues from these businesses are also affected by the prices of natural gasand natural gas liquids (NGL). NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis thatcorrelates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices ofnatural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and we expect thisvolatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crudeoil depend upon factors beyond our control. These factors include supply of anddemand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market andeconomic conditions and other factors.CERC’srevenues and results of operations are seasonal.Asubstantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales andtransportation. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject toseasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, withrevenues being higher during the winter months.Theactual cost of pipelines under construction, future pipeline, gathering andtreating systems and related compression facilities may be significantly higherthan CERC had planned.Subsidiariesof CERC Corp. have been recently involved in significant pipeline constructionprojects and, depending on available opportunities, may, from time to time, beinvolved in additional significant pipeline construction and gathering andtreating system projects in the future. The construction of new pipelines,gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may requirethe expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERC’sestimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on scheduleor at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating or compressionfacilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs ofequipment and materials such as steel and nickel, labor shortages or delays,weather delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. Inaddition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to thereceipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Thoseagencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may imposerestrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent aproject from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/orincrease its anticipated cost. As a result, there is the risk that the newfacilities may not be able to achieve CERC’s expected investment return, whichcould adversely affect CERC’s financial condition, results of operations or cashflows.Thestates in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, eitherthrough legislation or rules, adopt restrictions similar to or broader thanthose under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 regardingorganization, financing and affiliate transactions that could have significantadverse impacts on CERC’s ability to operate.ThePublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to which we and our subsidiarieswere subject prior to its repeal in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, provided acomprehensive regulatory structure governing the organization, capitalstructure, intracompany relationships and lines of business that could bepursued by registered holding companies and their member companies. Followingrepeal of that Act, some states in which CERC does business have sought toexpand their own regulatory frameworks to give their regulatory authoritiesincreased jurisdiction and scrutiny over similar aspects of the utilities thatoperate in their states. Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financingactivities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between theutilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utilitybusiness that can be conducted within the holding company structure.Additionally they may impose record keeping, record access, employee trainingand reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting inthe event of certain downgrading of the utility’s bond rating.28Table of Contents Theseregulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to conductits utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effectiveutility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions onsimilar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competingregulatory requirements. Therevenues and results of operations of CERC’s interstate pipelines and fieldservices businesses could be adversely impacted by new environmental regulationsgoverning the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwaternecessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells and the protection of water suppliesin the areas in and around shale fields.CERC’sinterstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gassourced in the various supply basins located in the Mid-continent region of theUnited States.  To extract natural gas from the shale fields in thisarea, producers have historically used a process called hydraulic fracturing.Recently, new environmental regulations governing the withdrawal, storage anduse of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wellsand the protection of water supplies in the areas in and around the shale fieldshave been considered by the federal government.  If enacted, suchregulations could increase operating costs of the producers in these regions orcause delays, interruptions or termination of drilling operations, all of whichcould result in a decrease in demand for the services provided by CERC’sinterstate pipelines and field services businesses in the shale fields, whichcould have an adverse effect on CERC’s results of operations, financialcondition and cash flows.RiskFactors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionIf we are unableto arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinanceexisting indebtedness could be limited.As ofDecember 31, 2009, we had $10.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness on aconsolidated basis, which includes $3.0 billion of non-recourse transitionand system restoration bonds. As of December 31, 2009, approximately$1.2 billion principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through2012. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately$831 million on transition and system restoration bonds, for which adedicated revenue stream exists, but includes $290 million of pollutioncontrol bonds issued on our behalf which we purchased in January 2010 (and whichmay be remarketed) and $45 million of debentures redeemed in January 2010.Our future financing activities may be significantly affected by, among otherthings:       •the      resolution of the true-up proceedings, including, in particular, the      results of appeals to the Texas Supreme Court regarding rulings obtained      to date;        •general      economic and capital marketconditions;        •credit      availability from financial institutions and other  lenders;        •investor      confidence in us and the markets in which we  operate;        •maintenance      of acceptable credit ratings;        •market      expectations regarding our future earnings and cash  flows;        •market      perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable      terms;        •our      exposure to RRI in connection with its indemnification obligations arising      in connection with its separation from us;and        •provisions      of relevant tax and securitieslaws.As ofDecember 31, 2009, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately$2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds,including approximately $527 million held in trust to secure pollutioncontrol bonds for which we are obligated and approximately $229 millionheld in trust to secure pollution control bonds for  29Table of Contents whichCenterPoint Houston is obligated. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston hadoutstanding approximately $253 million aggregate principal amount of firstmortgage bonds, including approximately $151 million held in trust tosecure certain pollution control bonds for which we are obligated. CenterPointHouston may issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retiredbonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the trustee.Approximately $2.1 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and generalmortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of retired bondsand 70% of property additions as of December 31, 2009. However, CenterPointHouston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional firstmortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.Ourcurrent credit ratings are discussed in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources- - Future Sources and Uses of Cash - Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in CreditRatings"" in Item 7 of Part II of this report. These credit ratings may notremain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratingsmay be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that thesecredit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Eachrating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any futurereduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have amaterial adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptableterms.Asa holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributionsfrom our subsidiaries to meet our payment obligations, and provisions ofapplicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of thosedistributions.We deriveall our operating income from, and hold all our assets through, oursubsidiaries. As a result, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiariesin order to meet our payment obligations. In general, these subsidiaries areseparate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us withfunds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans orotherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting thelegal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments orother distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractualrestrictions on their ability to make distributions.Our rightto receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of ourcreditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated tothe claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. Inaddition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditorwould be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiaryand any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.Theuse of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the normal course ofbusiness could result in financial losses that could negatively impact ourresults of operations and those of our subsidiaries.We andour subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures andforwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. We andour subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility inthe market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform.In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information fromexternal sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involvemanagement’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in theunderlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect thereported fair value of these contracts.RisksCommon to Our Businesses and Other RisksWeare subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising fromenvironmental laws and regulations.Ouroperations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertainingto health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator of natural gaspipelines and distribution systems, gas gathering and processing systems, andelectric transmission and distribution systems, we must comply with these lawsand regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws andregulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, suchas:       •restricting      the way we can handle or dispose ofwastes; 30Table of Contents        •limiting      or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as      wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered      species;        •requiring      remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations,      or attributable to former operations;and        •enjoining      the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued      pursuant to such environmental laws and  regulations. In orderto comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts anddevote other resources from time to time to:       •construct      or acquire new equipment;        •acquire      permits for facility operations;        •modify      or replace existing and proposed equipment;and        •clean      up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management      facilities and other locations andfacilities. Failureto comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety ofadministrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including theassessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and theissuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutesimpose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up andrestore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwisereleased. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and otherthird parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedlycaused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into theenvironment.Ourinsurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage andincreased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations,financial condition and cash flows.Wecurrently have general liability and property insurance in place to covercertain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policiesare subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include businessinterruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future atcurrent costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceedsreceived for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not besufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows.In commonwith other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions,CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission anddistribution system, other than substations, because CenterPoint Houstonbelieves it to be cost prohibitive. In the future, CenterPoint Houston may notbe able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission anddistribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters throughissuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates orotherwise, or any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore,CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any ofits transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on itsresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We,CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businessesand assets that we have transferred to others.Undersome circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilitiesassociated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longerown. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy,Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly orthrough subsidiaries and include: 31Table of Contents        •merchant      energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its      subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI      prior to its initial public offering in 2001;  and        •Texas      electric generating facilities transferred to Texas Genco Holdings, Inc.      (Texas Genco) in 2004 and early2005. Inconnection with the organization and capitalization of RRI, RRI and itssubsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businessesReliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause theapplicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associatedwith the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions wereintended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries forall liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses andoperations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI wereunable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in whichReliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability inconnection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could beresponsible for satisfying the liability.Prior tothe distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC hadguaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s tradingsubsidiary. When the companies separated, RRI agreed to secure CERC againstobligations under the guaranties RRI had been unable to extinguish by the timeof separation. Pursuant to such agreement, as amended in December 2007, RRI hasagreed to provide to CERC cash or letters of credit as security againstCERC’s obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges undercertain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in marketconditions expose CERC to a risk of loss on those guaranties.  The presentvalue of the demand charges under these transportation contracts, which will beeffective until 2018, was approximately $96 million as of December 31,2009. As of December 31, 2009, RRI was not required to provide security toCERC.  If RRI should fail to perform the contractual obligations, CERCcould have to honor its guarantee and, in such event, collateral provided assecurity may be insufficient to satisfy CERC’s obligations.RRI’sunsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade. If RRI were unableto meet its obligations, it would need to consider, among various options,restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI might not honor itsindemnification obligations and claims by RRI’s creditors might be made againstus as its former owner.On May 1,2009, RRI completed the previously announced sale of its Texas retail businessto NRG Retail LLC, a subsidiary of NRG Energy, Inc. In connection with the sale,RRI changed its name to RRI Energy, Inc. and no longer provides service as a REPin CenterPoint Houston’s service territory. The sale does not alter RRI’scontractual obligations to indemnify us and our subsidiaries, includingCenterPoint Houston, for certain liabilities, including their indemnificationregarding certain litigation, nor does it affect the terms of existing guarantyarrangements for certain RRI gas transportation contracts.ReliantEnergy and RRI are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out ofsales of natural gas in California and other markets. Although these mattersrelate to the business and operations of RRI, claims against Reliant Energy havebeen made on grounds that include liability of Reliant Energy as a controllingshareholder of RRI. We, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could incur liability ifclaims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us,CenterPoint Houston or CERC and indemnification from RRI were determined to beunavailable or if RRI were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owedwith respect to those claims.Inconnection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco, ReliantEnergy and Texas Genco entered into a separation agreement in which Texas Gencoassumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets ReliantEnergy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause theapplicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with thetransferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed wereobligations of CenterPoint Houston, and CenterPoint Houston was not released bythird parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intendedgenerally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and itssubsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historicalbusinesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time thoseliabilities arose. If Texas Genco were unable to satisfy a liability that hadbeen so  32Table of Contents assumedor indemnified against, and provided we or Reliant Energy had not been releasedfrom the liability in connection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could beresponsible for satisfying the liability.Inconnection with our sale of Texas Genco to a third party, the separationagreement was amended to provide that Texas Genco would no longer be liable for,and we would assume and agree to indemnify Texas Genco against, liabilities thatTexas Genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to theextent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are covered by certaininsurance policies held by us. Texas Genco and its related businesses nowoperate as subsidiaries of NRG Energy, Inc.We or oursubsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant inlawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure toasbestos. Some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but mostexisting claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries butcurrently owned by NRG Texas LP. We anticipate that additional claims like thosereceived may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangementsregarding separation of the generating business from us and its sale to NRGTexas LP, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claimsrelating to the generating business has been assumed by NRG Texas LP, but wehave agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered byinsurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of suchdefense by NRG Texas LP.Theunsettled conditions in the global financial system may have impacts on ourbusiness, liquidity and financial condition that we currently cannotpredict.Therecent credit crisis and unsettled conditions in the global financial system mayhave an impact on our business, liquidity and our financial condition. Ourability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time whenwe would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact onour liquidity and flexibility to react to changing economic and businessconditions. In addition, the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equityfinancing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions.Defaults of lenders in our credit facilities, should they further occur, couldadversely affect our liquidity. Capital market turmoil was also reflected insignificant reductions in equity market valuations in 2008, which significantlyreduced the value of assets of our pension plan. These reductions increasednon-cash pension expense in 2009 which impacted 2009 results of operations andmay impact liquidity if contributions are made to offset reduced assetvalues.Inaddition to the credit and financial market issues, a recurrence of national andlocal recessionary conditions may impact our business in a variety of ways.These include, among other things, reduced customer usage, increased customerdefault rates and wide swings in commodity prices.Climatechange legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increasedoperating costs and reduced demand for our services.Legislationto regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced in Congress, andthere has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally andinternationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means fortheir regulation.  In addition, efforts have been made and continue tobe made in the international community toward the adoption of internationaltreaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such asthe United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009. Also, theEPA has undertaken new efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gasemissions and their effects. Recently, the EPA declared that certain greenhousegases represent an endangerment to human health and proposed to expand itsregulations relating to those emissions.  It is too early to determinewhether, or in what form, further regulatory action regarding greenhouse gasemissions will be adopted or what specific impacts a new regulatory action mighthave on us and our subsidiaries. However, as a distributor and transporter ofnatural gas and consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gatheringbusinesses, CERC’s revenues, operating costs and capital requirements could beadversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would requireinstallation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations orwould have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas.  Ourelectric transmission and distribution business, in contrast to some electricutilities, does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to therisk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electricutilities that burn fossil fuels to generateelectricity.  Nevertheless, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues could beadversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effectof reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers  33Table of Contents withinits service territory. Likewise, incentives to conserve energy or use energysources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for ourservices.Climatechanges could result in more frequent severe weather events and warmertemperatures which could adversely affect the results of operations of ourbusinesses.To theextent climate changes occur, our businesses may be adversely impacted, thoughwe believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence wouldbe difficult to quantify with specificity.  To the extent globalclimate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories,financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could beadversely affected through lower gas sales, and our gas transmission and fieldservices businesses could experience lower revenues. Another possible climatechange that has been widely discussed in recent years is the possibility of morefrequent and more severe weather events, such as hurricanes ortornadoes.  Since many of our facilities are located along or near theGulf Coast, increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes can increase ourcosts to repair damaged facilities and restore service to ourcustomers.  When we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas tocustomers or our customers cannot receive our services, our financial resultscan be impacted by lost revenues, and we generally must seek approval fromregulators to recover restoration costs.  To the extent we are unableto recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of suchcosts result in reduced demand for our services, our future financial resultsmay be adversely impacted"
18,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2009-02-25,">Item 1A.         RiskFactorsWe are aholding company that conducts all of our business operations throughsubsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. The following, along withany additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference inItem 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk factors associatedwith the businesses conducted by each of these subsidiaries:RiskFactors Affecting Our Electric Transmission & DistributionBusinessCenterPointHouston may not be successful in ultimately recovering the full value ofits true-upcomponents, which could result in the elimination of certain tax benefits andcould have an adverse impact on CenterPoint Houston’s results of operations,financial condition and cash flows.In March2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its true-up application with the Texas UtilityCommission, requesting recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, asallowed under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004, theTexas Utility Commission issued its True-Up Order allowing CenterPoint Houstonto recover a true-up balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which includedinterest through August 31, 2004, and provided for adjustment of the amountto be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery, along withthe principal portion of additional EMCs returned to customers afterAugust 31, 2004 and certain other adjustments.CenterPointHouston and other parties filed appeals of the True-Up Order to a district courtin Travis County, Texas. In August 2005, that court issued its judgment on thevarious appeals. In its judgment, the district court:       •reversed      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that had denied recovery of a      portion of the capacity auction true-upamounts;        •reversed      the Texas Utility Commission’s ruling that precluded CenterPoint Houston      from recovering the interest component of the EMCs paid to      REPs; and        •affirmed      the True-Up Order in all otherrespects.Thedistrict court’s decision would have had the effect of restoring approximately$650 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the Texas UtilityCommission had disallowed from CenterPoint Houston’s initialrequest.CenterPointHouston and other parties appealed the district court’s judgment to the TexasThird Court of Appeals, which issued its decision in December 2007. In itsdecision, the court of appeals:       •reversed      the district court’s judgment to the extent it restored the capacity      auction true-up amounts; 21Table of Contents        •reversed      the district court’s judgment to the extent it upheld the Texas Utility      Commission’s decision to allow CenterPoint Houston to recover EMCs paid to      RRI;       •ordered      that the tax normalization issue described below be remanded to the Texas      Utility Commission as requested by the Texas Utility      Commission; and       •affirmed      the district court’s judgment in all other  respects.In April2008, the court of appeals denied all motions for rehearing and reissuedsubstantially the same opinion as it had rendered inDecember 2007.In June2008, CenterPoint Houston petitioned the Texas Supreme Court for review of thecourt of appeals decision. In its petition, CenterPoint Houston seeks reversalof the parts of the court of appeals decision that (i) denied recovery ofEMCs paid to RRI, (ii) denied recovery of the capacity auction true-upamounts allowed by the district court, (iii) affirmed the Texas UtilityCommission’s rulings that denied recovery of approximately $378 millionrelated to depreciation and (iv) affirmed the Texas Utility Commission’srefusal to permit CenterPoint Houston to utilize the partial stock valuationmethodology for determining the market value of its former generation assets.Two other petitions for review were filed with the Texas Supreme Court by otherparties to the appeal. In those petitions parties contend that (i) theTexas Utility Commission was without authority to fashion the methodology itused for valuing the former generation assets after it had determined thatCenterPoint Houston could not use the partial stock valuation method,(ii) in fashioning the method it used for valuing the former generatingassets, the Texas Utility Commission deprived parties of their due processrights and an opportunity to be heard, (iii) the net book value of thegenerating assets should have been adjusted downward due to the impact of apurchase option that had been granted to RRI, (iv) CenterPoint Houstonshould not have been permitted to recover construction work in progress balanceswithout proving those amounts in the manner required by law and (v) theTexas Utility Commission was without authority to award interest on the capacityauction true up award.Review bythe Texas Supreme Court of the court of appeals decision is at the discretion ofthe court. In November 2008, the Texas Supreme Court requested the partiesto the Petitions for Review to submit briefs on the merits of theissues raised. Briefing at the Texas Supreme Court should be completed in thesecond quarter of 2009. Although the Texas Supreme Court has not indicatedwhether it will grant review of the lower court’s decision, itsrequest for full briefing on the merits allowed the parties to more fullyexplain their positions. There is no prescribed time in which the Texas SupremeCourt must determine whether to grant review or, if review is granted, for adecision by that court. Although we and CenterPoint Houston believe thatCenterPoint Houston’s true-up request is consistent with applicable statutes andregulations and, accordingly, that it is reasonably possible that it will besuccessful in its appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, we can provide no assuranceas to the ultimate court rulings on the issues to be considered in the appeal orwith respect to the ultimate decision by the Texas Utility Commission on the taxnormalization issue described below.Toreflect the impact of the True-Up Order, in 2004 and 2005, we recorded a netafter-tax extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to thedistrict court’s judgment or the decision of the court of appeals have beenrecorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if the court ofappeals decision is not reversed or modified as a result of further review bythe Texas Supreme Court, we anticipate that we would be required to record anadditional loss to reflect the court of appeals decision. The amount of thatloss would depend on several factors, including ultimate resolution of the taxnormalization issue described below and the calculation of interest on anyamounts CenterPoint Houston ultimately is authorized to recover or is requiredto refund beyond the amounts recordedbased on the True-Up Order, but could range from $170 million to$385 million (pre-tax) plus interest subsequent to December 31,2008.In theTrue-Up Order, the Texas Utility Commission reduced CenterPoint Houston’sstranded cost recovery by approximately $146 million, which was included inthe extraordinary loss discussed above, for the present value of certaindeferred tax benefits associated with its former electric generation assets. Webelieve that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposedregulations issued by the IRS in March 2003 that would have allowed utilitiesowning assets that were deregulated before March 4, 2003 to make aretroactive election to pass the benefits of ADITC and EDFIT back to customers.However, the IRS subsequently withdrew those proposed normalization regulationsand in March 2008 adopted final regulations that would not permit utilities likeCenterPoint Houston to 22Table of Contentspass thetax benefits back to customers without creating normalization violations. Inaddition, we received a PLR from the IRS in August 2007, prior to adoption ofthe final regulations that confirmed that the Texas Utility Commission’s orderreducing CenterPoint Houston’s stranded cost recovery by $146 million forADITC and EDFIT would cause normalization violations with respect to the ADITCand EDFIT.If theTexas Utility Commission’s order relating to the ADITC reduction is not reversedor otherwise modified on remand so as to eliminate the normalization violation,the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to CenterPoint Houston’sunamortized ADITC balance as of the date that the normalization violation isdeemed to have occurred. In addition, the IRS could deny CenterPoint Houston theability to elect accelerated tax depreciation benefits beginning in the taxableyear that the normalization violation is deemed to have occurred. Suchtreatment, if required by the IRS, could have a material adverse impact on ourresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows in addition to anypotential loss resulting from final resolution of the True-Up Order. In itsopinion, the court of appeals ordered that this issue be remanded to the TexasUtility Commission, as that commission requested. No party, in the petitions forreview or briefs filed with the Texas Supreme Court, has challenged that orderby the court of appeals, though the Texas Supreme Court, if it grants review,will have authority to consider all aspects of the rulings above, not just thosechallenged specifically by the appellants. We and CenterPoint Houston willcontinue to pursue a favorable resolution of this issue through the appellate oradministrative process. Although the Texas Utility Commission has not previouslyrequired a company subject to its jurisdiction to take action that would resultin a normalization violation, no prediction can be made as to the ultimateaction the Texas Utility Commission may take on this issue onremand.CenterPointHouston must seek recovery of significant restoration costs arising fromHurricaneIke.CenterPointHouston’s electric delivery system suffered substantial damage as a result ofHurricane Ike, which struck the upper Texas coast on September 13, 2008.CenterPoint Houston estimates that total costs to restore the electric deliveryfacilities damaged as a result of Hurricane Ike will be in the range of$600 million to $650 million.CenterPointHouston believes it is entitled to recover prudently incurred storm costs inaccordance with applicable regulatory and legal principles. The TexasLegislature currently is considering  passage of legislation thatwould (i) authorize the Texas Utility Commission to determine the amount ofstorm restoration costs that CenterPoint Houston would be entitled to recoverand (ii) permit the Texas Utility Commission to issue a financing orderthat would allow CenterPoint Houston to recover the amount of storm restorationcosts determined in such a proceeding through issuance of dedicatedsecuritization bonds, which would be repaid over time through a charge imposedon REPs. In proceedings to determine and seek recovery of storm restorationcosts under the proposed legislation, CenterPoint Houston would be required toprove to the Texas Utility Commission’s satisfaction its prudently incurredcosts as well as to demonstrate the cost benefit from using securitization torecover those costs instead of alternative means. Alternatively, CenterPointHouston has the right to seek recovery of these costs under traditional ratemaking principles. CenterPoint Houston’s failure to recover costs incurred as aresult of Hurricane Ike could adversely affect its liquidity, results ofoperations and financial condition. For more information about CenterPointHouston’s recovery from Hurricane Ike, please read “Business — ElectricTransmission & Distribution — Hurricane Ike” in Item 1 ofthis report. CenterPointHouston’s receivables are concentrated in a small number of retail electricproviders, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affectCenterPointHouston’s cash flows, financial condition and results ofoperations. CenterPointHouston’s receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected fromREPs that supply the electricity CenterPoint Houston distributes to theircustomers. As of December 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston did business with79 REPs. Adverse economic conditions, structural problems in the market servedby ERCOT or financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the abilityof these REPs to pay for CenterPoint Houston’s services or could cause them todelay such payments. In 2008, seven REPs selling power within CenterPointHouston’s service territory ceased to operate, and their customers weretransferred to the provider of last resort or to other REPs. CenterPoint Houstondepends on these REPs to remit payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatoryprovisions require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort if aREP cannot make timely payments. Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulationssignificantly limit the extent to which CenterPoint Houston can demand creditprotection from REPs for payments not made prior to the shift to the provider oflast resort. However, 23Table of Contentsthe TexasUtility Commission is currently considering proposed revisions to thoseregulations that, as currently proposed, would (i) increase the creditprotections that could be required from REPs, and (ii) allow utilities to deferthe loss of  payments for recovery in a future rate case. Whether suchrevised regulations will ultimately be adopted and their terms cannot now bedetermined. RRI, through its subsidiaries, is CenterPoint Houston’s largestcustomer. Approximately 46% of CenterPoint Houston’s $141 million in billedreceivables from REPs at December 31, 2008 was owed by subsidiaries of RRI.Any delay or default in payment by REPs such as RRI could adversely affectCenterPoint Houston’s cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.RRI’s unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade. If RRI wereunable to meet its obligations, it could consider, among various options,restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI’s subsidiaries mightseek to avoid honoring their obligations and claims might be made by creditorsinvolving payments CenterPoint Houston has received from RRI’ssubsidiaries.Rate regulationof CenterPoint Houston’s business may delay or deny CenterPoint Houston’s abilityto earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs.CenterPointHouston’s rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the Texas UtilityCommission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in atest year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to charge may notmatch its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process by which rates aredetermined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery ofCenterPoint Houston’s costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonablereturn on its invested capital.In thisregard, pursuant to the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement approved by theTexas Utility Commission in September  2006, until June 30, 2010CenterPoint Houston is limited in its ability to request retail rate relief. Formore information on the Stipulation and Settlement Agreement, please read“Business — Regulation — State and Local Regulation — ElectricTransmission & Distribution — CenterPoint Houston Rate Agreement”in Item 1 of this report.Disruptions atpower generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt CenterPointHouston’s sales of transmission and distribution services.CenterPointHouston transmits and distributes to customers of REPs electric power that theREPs obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPointHouston does not own or operate any power generation facilities. If powergeneration is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate,CenterPoint Houston’s sales of transmission and distribution services may bediminished or interrupted, and its results of operations, financial conditionand cash flows could be adversely affected.CenterPointHouston’s revenues and results of operations are seasonal.Asignificant portion of CenterPoint Houston’s revenues is derived from rates thatit collects from each REP based on the amount of electricity it delivers onbehalf of such REP. Thus, CenterPoint Houston’s revenues and results ofoperations are subject to seasonality, weather conditions and other changes inelectricity usage, with revenues being higher during the warmermonths. Risk Factors
 Affecting Our NaturalGas Distribution, Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate Pipelinesand Field Services BusinessesRate regulationof CERC’s business may delay or deny CERC’s ability to earn a reasonable returnand fully recover its costs.CERC’srates for Gas Operations are regulated by certain municipalities and statecommissions, and for its interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysisof its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the rates thatCERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time. Theregulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in ratesthat will produce full recovery of CERC’s costs and enable CERC to earn areasonable return on its invested capital.24Table of ContentsCERC’s businessesmust compete with alternate energy sources, which could result in CERC marketingless natural gas, and its interstate pipelines and field services businesses mustcompete directly with others in the transportation, storage, gathering,treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to lower pricesand reducedvolumes, either of which could have an adverse impact on CERC’s resultsofoperations, financial condition and cash flows.CERCcompetes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and otherfuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gasdistributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas salesto end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affectinginterstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may beable to bypass CERC’s facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gasdirectly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount ofnatural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition mayhave an adverse impact on CERC’s results of operations, financial condition andcash flows.CERC’stwo interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete with other interstateand intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in the transportation and storageof natural gas. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms ofservice, and flexibility and reliability of service. They also competeindirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coal and fueloils. The primary competitive factor is price. The actions of CERC’s competitorscould lead to lower prices, which may have an adverse impact on CERC’s resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, any reductionin the volume of natural gas transported or stored may have an adverse impact onCERC’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.CERC’s naturalgas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services businesses aresubject to fluctuations in natural gas prices, which could affect theability of CERC’s suppliers and customers to meet their obligations orotherwiseadversely affect CERC’s liquidity and results of operations.CERC issubject to risk associated with increases in the price of natural gas. Increasesin natural gas prices might affect CERC’s ability to collect balances due fromits customers and, for Gas Operations, could create the potential foruncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built intoCERC’s tariff rates. In addition, a sustained period of high natural gas pricescould (i) apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in theareas in which CERC operates thereby resulting in decreased sales volumes andrevenues and (ii) increase the risk that CERC’s suppliers or customers failor are unable to meet their obligations. Additionally, increasing natural gasprices could create the need for CERC to provide collateral in order to purchasenatural gas.A decline inCERC’s credit rating could result in CERC’s having to provide collateralin order topurchase gas.If CERC’scredit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cash collateral inorder to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultantcash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was experiencingsignificant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC’sresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adverselyaffected. The revenues andresults of operations of CERC’s interstate pipelines and field servicesbusinesses are subject to fluctuations in the supply and price of naturalgas. CERC’sinterstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gassourced in the various supply basins located in the Mid-continent region of theUnited States. The level of drilling and production activity in these regions isdependent on economic and business factors beyond our control. The primaryfactor affecting both the level of drilling activity and production volumes isnatural gas pricing. A sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in adecrease in exploration and development activities in the regions served by ourgathering and pipeline transportation systems and our natural gas treating andprocessing activities. A sustained decline could also lead producers to shut inproduction from their existing wells. Other factors that impact productiondecisions include the level of production costs relative to other availableproduction, producers’ access to needed capital and the cost of that capital,the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmentalpermits, access to drilling rigs and regulatory changes. Because of thesefactors, even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by ourassets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves or to shut inproduction from 25Table of Contentsexistingreserves. To the extent the availability of this supply is substantiallyreduced, it could have an adverse effect on CERC’s results of operations,financial condition and cash flows.CERC’srevenues from these businesses are also affected by the prices of natural gasand natural gas liquids (NGL). NGL prices generally fluctuate on a basis thatcorrelates to fluctuations in crude oil prices. In the past, the prices ofnatural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile, and we expect thisvolatility to continue. The markets and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crudeoil depend upon factors beyond our control. These factors include supply of anddemand for these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market andeconomic conditions and other factors.CERC’srevenues and results of operations are seasonal.Asubstantial portion of CERC’s revenues is derived from natural gas sales andtransportation. Thus, CERC’s revenues and results of operations are subject toseasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, withrevenues being higher during the winter months.The actual costof pipelines under construction and related compression facilities may besignificantly higher than CERC had planned.Subsidiariesof CERC Corp. have been recently involved in significant pipeline constructionprojects and, depending on available opportunities, may, from time to time, beinvolved in additional significant pipeline construction projects in the future.The construction of new pipelines and related compression facilities requiresthe expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERC’sestimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on scheduleor at all. The construction of new pipeline or compression facilities is subjectto construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs of equipment andmaterials such as steel and nickel, labor shortages or delays, weather delays,inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, theconstruction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt ofapprovals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may notapprove the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditionson the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding,lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost.As a result, there is the risk that the new facilities may not be able toachieve CERC’s expected investment return, which could adversely affect CERC’sfinancial condition, results of operations or cash flows.The states inwhich CERC provides regulated local gas distribution may, either throughlegislation or rules, adopt restrictions similar to or broader than thoseunder thePublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 regarding organization, financing andaffiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts onCERC’sability to operate.ThePublic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to which we and our subsidiarieswere subject prior to its repeal in the Energy Act, provided a comprehensiveregulatory structure governing the organization, capital structure, intracompanyrelationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holdingcompanies and their member companies. Following repeal of that Act, some statesin which CERC does business have sought to expand their own regulatoryframeworks to give their regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction andscrutiny over similar aspects of the utilities that operate in their states.Some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financingactivities, acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between theutilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of non-utilitybusinesses that can be conducted within the holding company structure.Additionally they may impose record keeping, record access, employee trainingand reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting inthe event of certain downgrading of the utility’s bond rating.Theseregulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on CERC’s ability to operateits utility operations, to finance its business and to provide cost-effectiveutility service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions oversimilar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to comply with competingregulatory requirements.26Table of ContentsRiskFactors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial ConditionIf we are unableto arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our ability to refinanceexisting indebtedness could be limited.As ofDecember 31, 2008, we had $10.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness ona consolidated basis, which includes $2.6 billion of non-recoursetransition bonds. As of December 31, 2008, approximately $953 millionprincipal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2011. This amountexcludes principal repayments of approximately $669 million on transitionbonds, for which a dedicated revenue stream exists. Our future financingactivities may be significantly affected by, among other things:       •the      resolution of the true-up components, including, in particular, the      results of appeals to the courts regarding rulings obtained to      date;       •CenterPoint      Houston’s recovery of costs arising from Hurricane  Ike;       •general      economic and capital marketconditions;       •credit      availability from financial institutions and other  lenders;       •investor      confidence in us and the markets in which we  operate;       •maintenance      of acceptable credit ratings;       •market      expectations regarding our future earnings and cash  flows;       •market      perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable      terms;       •our      exposure to RRI in connection with its indemnification obligations arising      in connection with its separation from  us; and       •provisions      of relevant tax and securitieslaws.As ofDecember 31, 2008, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately$2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds,including approximately $527 million held in trust to secure pollutioncontrol bonds for which we are obligated, $600 million securing borrowingsunder a credit facility which was unutilized and approximately $229 millionheld in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston isobligated. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately$253 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds, includingapproximately $151 million held in trust to secure certain pollutioncontrol bonds for which we are obligated. CenterPoint Houston may issueadditional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of propertyadditions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $1.8 billion ofadditional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregatecould be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions asof December 31, 2008. However, CenterPoint Houston has contractually agreedthat it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds, subject to certainexceptions. In January 2009, CenterPoint Houston issued $500 millionaggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds in a publicoffering. Ourcurrent credit ratings are discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations of CenterPoint Energy, Inc. andSubsidiaries — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Future Sourcesand Uses of Cash — Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit Ratings” inItem 7 of this report. These credit ratings may not remain in effect forany given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered orwithdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are notrecommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. Each rating should beevaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction or withdrawalof one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on ourability to access capital on acceptable terms.27Table of ContentsAs a holdingcompany with no operations of our own, we will depend on distributionsfrom oursubsidiaries to meet our payment obligations, and provisions ofapplicable law orcontractual restrictions could limit the amount of thosedistributions.We deriveall our operating income from, and hold all our assets through, oursubsidiaries. As a result, we will depend on distributions from our subsidiariesin order to meet our payment obligations. In general, these subsidiaries areseparate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us withfunds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans orotherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting thelegal sources of dividends, limit our subsidiaries’ ability to make payments orother distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree to contractualrestrictions on their ability to make distributions.Our rightto receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of ourcreditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated tothe claims of that subsidiary’s creditors, including trade creditors. Inaddition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rights as a creditorwould be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiaryand any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by us.The use ofderivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the normal course ofbusinesscould result in financial losses that could negatively impact our resultsof operations andthose of our subsidiaries.We andour subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures andforwards, to manage our commodity, weather and financial market risks. We andour subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility inthe market values of these contracts, or should a counterparty fail to perform.In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information fromexternal sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involvemanagement’s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in theunderlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect thereported fair value of these contracts.RisksCommon to Our Businesses and Other RisksWe are subject tooperational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmentallaws and regulations.Ouroperations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertainingto health, safety and the environment as described in “Business— Environmental Matters” in Item 1 of this Form 10-K. As an owneror operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas gathering andprocessing systems, and electric transmission and distribution systems, we mustcomply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels.These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities inmany ways, such as:       •restricting      the way we can handle or dispose ofwastes;       •limiting      or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as      wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered      species;       •requiring      remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations,      or attributable to formeroperations; and        •enjoining      the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued      pursuant to such environmental laws and  regulations.In orderto comply with these requirements, we may need to spend substantial amounts anddevote other resources from time to time to:       •construct      or acquire new equipment;       •acquire      permits for facility operations;       •modify      or replace existing and proposed  equipment; and 28Table of Contents        •clean      up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and management      facilities and other locations andfacilities.Failureto comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety ofadministrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including theassessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and theissuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutesimpose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up andrestore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwisereleased. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and otherthird parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedlycaused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into theenvironment.Our insurancecoverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance coverage and increasedinsurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations,financial condition andcash flows.Wecurrently have general liability and property insurance in place to covercertain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Such policiesare subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include businessinterruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future atcurrent costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceedsreceived for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities may not besufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows.In commonwith other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions,CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmission anddistribution system because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be costprohibitive. CenterPoint Houston may not be able to recover the costs incurredin restoring its transmission and distribution properties following HurricaneIke, or any such costs sustained in the future, through a change in itsregulated rates, and any such recovery may not be timely granted. Therefore,CenterPoint Houston may not be able to restore any loss of, or damage to, any ofits transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on itsresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We, CenterPointHouston and CERC could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets thatwe have transferred to others.Undersome circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilitiesassociated with assets and businesses we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longerown. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy,Incorporated (Reliant Energy), a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly orthrough subsidiaries and include:       •merchant      energy, energy trading and REP businesses transferred to RRI or its      subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI      prior to its initial public offering in  2001; and       •Texas      electric generating facilities transferred to Texas Genco Holdings, Inc.      (Texas Genco) in 2004 and early2005. Inconnection with the organization and capitalization of RRI, RRI and itssubsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businessesReliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, andcause theapplicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associatedwith the transferred assets and businesses. These indemnity provisions wereintended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries forall liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses andoperations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI wereunable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in whichReliant Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability inconnection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could beresponsible for satisfying the liability.Prior tothe distribution of our ownership in RRI to our shareholders, CERC hadguaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became RRI’s tradingsubsidiary. Under the terms of the separation agreement between the companies,RRI agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to separation, butat the time of separation 29Table of ContentsinSeptember 2002, RRI had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secureCERC against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI agreed to providecash or letters of credit for CERC’s benefit, and undertook to use commerciallyreasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties. InDecember 2007, we, CERC and RRI amended that agreement and CERC releasedthe letters of credit it held as security. Under the revised agreement, RRIagreed to provide cash or new letters of credit to secure CERC against exposureunder the remaining guaranties as calculated under the revised agreement if andto the extent changes in market conditions exposed CERC to a risk of loss onthose guaranties.Thepotential exposure to CERC under the guaranties relates to payment of demandcharges related to transportation contracts. The present value of the demandcharges under these transportation contracts, which will be effective until2018, was approximately $108 million as of December 31, 2008. RRIcontinues to meet its obligations under the contracts, and on the basis ofmarket conditions, we and CERC have not required additional security. However,if RRI should fail to perform its obligations under the contracts or if RRIshould fail to provide adequate security in the event market conditions changeadversely, we would retain our exposure to the counterparty under theguaranty.RRI’sunsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade. If RRI were unableto meet its obligations, it would need to consider, among various options,restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI might not honor itsindemnification obligations and claims by RRI’s creditors might be made againstus as its former owner.ReliantEnergy and RRI are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out ofenergy sales in California and other markets and financial reporting matters.Although these matters relate to the business and operations of RRI, claimsagainst Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include the effect ofRRI’s financial results on Reliant Energy’s historical financial statements andliability of Reliant Energy as a controlling shareholder of RRI. We, CenterPointHouston or CERC could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuitswere successfully asserted against us, CenterPoint Houston or CERC andindemnification from RRI were determined to be unavailable or if RRI were unableto satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to thoseclaims.Inconnection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco, Texas Gencoassumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets ReliantEnergy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause theapplicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities associated with thetransferred assets and businesses. In many cases the liabilities assumed wereobligations of CenterPoint Houston and CenterPoint Houston was not released bythird parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were intendedgenerally to place sole financial responsibility on Texas Genco and itssubsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historicalbusinesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the time thoseliabilities arose. In connection with the sale of Texas Genco’s fossilgeneration assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to NRG Texas LP(previously named Texas Genco LLC), the separation agreement we enteredinto with Texas Genco in connection with the organization and capitalization ofTexas Genco was amended to provide that all of Texas Genco’s rights andobligations under the separation agreement relating to its fossil generationassets, including Texas Genco’s obligation to indemnify us with respect toliabilities associated with the fossil generation assets and related business,were assigned to and assumed by NRG Texas LP. In addition, under the amendedseparation agreement, Texas Genco is no longer liable for, and we have assumedand agreed to indemnify NRG Texas LPagainst, liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with itsorganization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities arecovered by certain insurancepolicies or other similar agreements held by us. If Texas Genco or NRG Texas LPwere unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnifiedagainst, and provided Reliant Energy had not been released from the liability inconnection with the transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible forsatisfying the liability.We or oursubsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as a defendant inlawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure toasbestos. Most claimants in such litigation have been workers who participatedin construction of various industrial facilities, including power plants. Someof the claimants have worked at locations owned by us, but most existing claimsrelate to facilities previously owned by us or our subsidiaries but currentlyowned by NRG Texas LP. We anticipate that additional claims like those receivedmay be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the arrangements regardingseparation of the generating business from us and its sale to NRG Texas LP,ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relatingto 30Table of Contentsthegenerating business has been assumed by NRG Texas LP, but we have agreed tocontinue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurancemaintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by NRGTexas LP.The globalfinancial crisis may have impacts on our business, liquidity and financialcondition that we currentlycannot predict.Thecontinued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system mayhave an impact on our business, liquidity and our financial condition. Ourability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time whenwe would like, or need, to access those markets, which could have an impact onour liquidity and flexibility to react to changing economic and businessconditions. In addition, the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equityfinancing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions. Withrespect to our existing debt arrangements, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, which hadan approximately four percent participation in our credit facility and each ofthe then-existing credit facilities of our subsidiaries, stopped funding itscommitments following the bankruptcy filing of its parent in September 2008 andwas subsequently terminated as a lender in our facility and the facility ofCenterPoint Houston. Defaults of other lenders should they occur could adverselyaffect our liquidity. Capital market turmoil was also reflected in significantreductions in equity market valuations in 2008, which significantly reduced thevalue of assets of our pension plan. These reductions are expected to result inincreased non-cash pension expense in 2009, which will impact 2009 results ofoperations.Inaddition to the credit and financial market issues, the national and localrecessionary conditions may impact our business in a variety of ways. Theseinclude, among other things, reduced customer usage, increased customer defaultrates and wide swings in commodity prices"
3,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2008-02-28,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     We are a holding company that conducts all of our business    operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston    and CERC. The following, along with any additional legal    proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in    Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk    factors associated with the businesses conducted by each of    these subsidiaries: Risk    Factors Affecting Our Electric Transmission &    Distribution Business CenterPoint    Houston may not be successful in ultimately recovering the full    value of its    true-up    components, which could result in the elimination of certain tax    benefits and could have an adverse impact on CenterPoint    Houstons results of operations, financial condition and    cash flows.     In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its    true-up    application with the Texas Utility Commission, requesting    recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as allowed    under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004,    the Texas Utility Commission issued the    True-Up    Order allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a    true-up    balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included    interest through August 31, 2004, and provided for    adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on    the balance until recovery, along with the principal portion of    additional EMCs returned to customers after August 31, 2004    and in certain other respects.     CenterPoint Houston and other parties filed appeals of the    True-Up    Order to a district court in Travis County, Texas. In August    2005, that court issued its judgment on the various appeals. In    its judgment, the district court:           reversed the Texas Utility Commissions ruling that had    denied recovery of a portion of the capacity auction    true-up    amounts;           reversed the Texas Utility Commissions ruling that    precluded CenterPoint Houston from recovering the interest    component of the EMCs paid to REPs; and           affirmed the    True-Up    Order in all other respects.     The district courts decision would have had the effect of    restoring approximately $650 million, plus interest, of the    $1.7 billion the Texas Utility Commission had disallowed    from CenterPoint Houstons initial request.     CenterPoint Houston and other parties appealed the district    courts judgment to the Texas Third Court of Appeals, which    issued its decision in December 2007. In its decision, the court    of appeals:           reversed the district courts judgment to the extent it    restored the capacity auction    true-up    amounts;           reversed the district courts judgment to the extent it    upheld the Texas Utility Commissions decision to allow    CenterPoint Houston to recover EMCs paid to RRI;           ordered that the tax normalization issue described below be    remanded to the Texas Utility Commission; and           affirmed the district courts judgment in all other    respects.     CenterPoint Houston and two other parties filed motions for    rehearing with the court of appeals. In the event that the    motions for rehearing are not resolved in a manner favorable to    it, CenterPoint Houston intends to seek further review by the    Texas Supreme Court. Although we and CenterPoint Houston believe    that CenterPoint Houstons    true-up    request is consistent with applicable statutes and regulations    and accordingly that it is reasonably possible that it will be    successful in its further appeals, we can provide no assurance    as to the ultimate rulings by the courts on the issues to be    considered in the various appeals or with respect to the    ultimate decision by the Texas Utility Commission on the tax    normalization issue described below.     To reflect the impact of the    True-Up    Order, in 2004 and 2005 we recorded a net after-tax    extraordinary loss of $947 million. No amounts related to    the district courts judgment or the decision of the court    of appeals have been    22Table of Contents    recorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if    the court of appeals decision is not reversed or modified as a    result of the pending motions for rehearing or on further review    by the Texas Supreme Court, we anticipate that we would be    required to record an additional loss to reflect the court of    appeals decision. The amount of that loss would depend on    several factors, including ultimate resolution of the tax    normalization issue described below and the calculation of    interest on any amounts CenterPoint Houston ultimately is    authorized to recover or is required to refund beyond the    amounts recorded based on the    True-up    Order, but could range from $130 million to    $350 million, plus interest subsequent to December 31,    2007.     In the    True-Up    Order the Texas Utility Commission reduced CenterPoint    Houstons stranded cost recovery by approximately    $146 million, which was included in the extraordinary loss    discussed above, for the present value of certain deferred tax    benefits associated with its former electric generation assets.    We believe that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on    proposed regulations issued by the IRS in March 2003 which would    have allowed utilities owning assets that were deregulated    before March 4, 2003 to make a retroactive election to pass    the benefits of ADITC and EDFIT back to customers. However, in    December 2005, the IRS withdrew those proposed normalization    regulations and issued new proposed regulations that do not    include the provision allowing a retroactive election to pass    the tax benefits back to customers. We subsequently requested a    PLR asking the IRS whether the Texas Utility Commissions    order reducing CenterPoint Houstons stranded cost recovery    by $146 million for ADITC and EDFIT would cause    normalization violations. In that ruling, which was received in    August 2007, the IRS concluded that such reductions would cause    normalization violations with respect to the ADITC and EDFIT. As    in a similar PLR issued in May 2006 to another Texas utility,    the IRS did not reference its proposed regulations.     The district court affirmed the Texas Utility Commissions    ruling on the tax normalization issue, but in response to a    request from the Texas Utility Commission, the court of appeals    ordered that the tax normalization issue be remanded for further    consideration. If the Texas Utility Commissions order    relating to the ADITC reduction is not reversed or otherwise    modified on remand so as to eliminate the normalization    violation, the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to    CenterPoint Houstons unamortized ADITC balance as of the    date that the normalization violation is deemed to have    occurred. In addition, the IRS could deny CenterPoint Houston    the ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation benefits    beginning in the taxable year that the normalization violation    is deemed to have occurred. Such treatment if required by the    IRS, could have a material adverse impact on our results of    operations, financial condition and cash flows in addition to    any potential loss resulting from final resolution of the    True-Up    Order. However, we and CenterPoint Houston will continue to    pursue a favorable resolution of this issue through the    appellate or administrative process. Although the Texas Utility    Commission has not previously required a company subject to its    jurisdiction to take action that would result in a normalization    violation, no prediction can be made as to the ultimate action    the Texas Utility Commission may take on this issue on remand. CenterPoint    Houstons receivables are concentrated in a small number of    REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect    CenterPoint Houstons cash flows, financial condition and    results of operations.     CenterPoint Houstons receivables from the distribution of    electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity    CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. Currently,    CenterPoint Houston does business with 74 REPs. Adverse economic    conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or    financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the    ability of these retail providers to pay for CenterPoint    Houstons services or could cause them to delay such    payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit    payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions    require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort    if a retail electric provider cannot make timely payments.    Applicable Texas Utility Commission regulations limit the extent    to which CenterPoint Houston can demand security from REPs for    payment of its delivery charges. RRI, through its subsidiaries,    is CenterPoint Houstons largest customer. Approximately    48% of CenterPoint Houstons $141 million in billed    receivables from REPs at December 31, 2007 was owed by    subsidiaries of RRI. Any delay or default in payment could    adversely affect CenterPoint Houstons cash flows,    financial condition and results of operations.    23Table of ContentsRate    regulation of CenterPoint Houstons business may delay or    deny CenterPoint Houstons ability to earn a reasonable    return and fully recover its costs.     CenterPoint Houstons rates are regulated by certain    municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an    analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test    year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to    charge may not match its expenses at any given time. In this    connection, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, discussed in    Business  Regulation  State and    Local Regulation  Electric Transmission &    Distribution  CenterPoint Houston Rate    Agreement in Item 1 of this report, until    June 30, 2010 CenterPoint Houston is limited in its ability    to request rate relief. The regulatory process by which rates    are determined may not always result in rates that will produce    full recovery of CenterPoint Houstons costs and enable    CenterPoint Houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested    capital. Disruptions    at power generation facilities owned by third parties could    interrupt CenterPoint Houstons sales of transmission and    distribution services.     CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of    REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation    facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not    own or operate any power generation facilities. If power    generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is    inadequate, CenterPoint Houstons sales of transmission and    distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be    adversely affected. CenterPoint    Houstons revenues and results of operations are    seasonal.     A significant portion of CenterPoint Houstons revenues is    derived from rates that it collects from each retail electric    provider based on the amount of electricity it distributes on    behalf of such retail electric provider. Thus, CenterPoint    Houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to    seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity    usage, with revenues being higher during the warmer months. Risk    Factors Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive    Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate Pipelines and Field    Services Businesses Rate    regulation of CERCs business may delay or deny CERCs    ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its    costs.     CERCs rates for its Gas Operations are regulated by    certain municipalities and state commissions, and for its    interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysis of its    invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus, the    rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its expenses    at any given time. The regulatory process in which rates are    determined may not always result in rates that will produce full    recovery of CERCs costs and enable CERC to earn a    reasonable return on its invested capital. CERCs    businesses must compete with alternative energy sources, which    could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, and its    interstate pipelines and field services businesses must compete    directly with others in the transportation, storage, gathering,    treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to    lower prices, either of which could have an adverse impact on    CERCs results of operations, financial condition and cash    flows.     CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as    electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate    pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also    compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end-users.    In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting    interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these    pipelines may be able to bypass CERCs facilities and    market, sell    and/or    transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial    customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed,    sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have    an adverse impact on CERCs results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows.     CERCs two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems    compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and    gathering systems in the transportation and storage of natural    gas. The principal elements of    24Table of Contents    competition are rates, terms of service, and flexibility and    reliability of service. They also compete indirectly with other    forms of energy, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The    primary competitive factor is price. The actions of CERCs    competitors could lead to lower prices, which may have an    adverse impact on CERCs results of operations, financial    condition and cash flows. CERCs    natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and    services businesses are subject to fluctuations in natural gas    pricing levels, which could affect the ability of CERCs    suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise    adversely affect CERCs liquidity.     CERC is subject to risk associated with increases in the price    of natural gas. Increases in natural gas prices might affect    CERCs ability to collect balances due from its customers    and, for Gas Operations, could create the potential for    uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels    built into CERCs tariff rates. In addition, a sustained    period of high natural gas prices could apply downward demand    pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which CERC    operates and increase the risk that CERCs suppliers or    customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations.    Additionally, increasing natural gas prices could create the    need for CERC to provide collateral in order to purchase natural    gas. If    CERC were to fail to renegotiate a contract with one of its    significant pipeline customers or if CERC renegotiates the    contract on less favorable terms, there could be an adverse    impact on its operations.     Since October 31, 2006, CERCs contract with Laclede,    one of its pipeline customers, has been terminable upon one    years prior notice. CERC has not received a termination    notice and is currently negotiating a long-term contract with    Laclede. If Laclede were to terminate this contract or if CERC    were to renegotiate this contract at rates substantially lower    than the rates provided in the current contract, there could be    an adverse effect on CERCs results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows. A    decline in CERCs credit rating could result in CERCs    having to provide collateral in order to purchase    gas.     If CERCs credit rating were to decline, it might be    required to post cash collateral in order to purchase natural    gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash    collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was    experiencing significant working capital requirements or    otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC might be unable to obtain the    necessary natural gas to meet its obligations to customers, and    its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows    would be adversely affected. The    revenues and results of operations of CERCs interstate    pipelines and field services businesses are subject to    fluctuations in the supply of natural gas.     CERCs interstate pipelines and field services businesses    largely rely on natural gas sourced in the various supply basins    located in the Mid-continent region of the United States. To the    extent the availability of this supply is substantially reduced,    it could have an adverse effect on CERCs results of    operations, financial condition and cash flows. CERCs    revenues and results of operations are seasonal.     A substantial portion of CERCs revenues is derived from    natural gas sales and transportation. Thus, CERCs revenues    and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather    conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues    being higher during the winter months. The    actual cost of pipelines under construction and related    compression facilities may be significantly higher than    CERCs current estimates.     Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. are involved in significant pipeline    construction projects. The construction of new pipelines and    related compression facilities requires the expenditure of    significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERCs    estimates. These projects may not be completed at the budgeted    cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline or    compression facilities is subject to construction cost overruns    due to labor costs,    25Table of Contents    costs of equipment and materials such as steel and nickel, labor    shortages or delays, weather delays, inflation or other factors,    which could be material. In addition, the construction of these    facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and    permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not    approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose    restrictions or conditions on the projects that could    potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its    expected completion schedule    and/or    increase its anticipated cost. As a result, there is the risk    that the new facilities may not be able to achieve CERCs    expected investment return, which could adversely affect    CERCs financial condition, results of operations or cash    flows. The    states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution    may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions    similar to or broader than those under the Public Utility    Holding Company Act of 1935 regarding organization, financing    and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse    impacts on CERCs ability to operate.     The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to which the    Company was subject prior to its repeal in the Energy Act,    provided a comprehensive regulatory structure governing the    organization, capital structure, intracompany relationships and    lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding    companies and their member companies. Following repeal of that    Act, some states in which CERC does business have sought to    expand their own regulatory frameworks to give their regulatory    authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over similar    aspects of the utilities that operate in their states. Some of    these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities,    acquisitions and divestitures, and arrangements between the    utilities and their affiliates, and to restrict the level of    non-utility businesses that can be conducted within the holding    company structure. Additionally they may impose record keeping,    record access, employee training and reporting requirements    related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of    certain downgrading of the utilitys bond rating.     These regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on    CERCs ability to operate its utility operations, to    finance its business and to provide cost-effective utility    service. In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions    over similar activities, it may be difficult for CERC and us to    comply with competing regulatory requirements. Risk    Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial    Condition If we    are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our    ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be    limited.     As of December 31, 2007, we had $9.7 billion of    outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes    $2.3 billion of non-recourse transition bonds. As of    December 31, 2007, approximately $842 million    principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through    2010. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately    $525 million on transition bonds, for which a dedicated    revenue stream exists. In addition, as of December 31,    2007, we had $535 million of outstanding 3.75% convertible    notes on which holders could exercise their conversion rights    during the first quarter of 2008 and in subsequent quarters in    which our common stock price causes such notes to be    convertible. In January and February 2008, holders of our 3.75%    convertible senior notes converted approximately    $123 million principal amount of such notes. In February    2008, we issued approximately $488 million of additional    non-recourse transition bonds. Our future financing activities    may depend, at least in part, on:           the resolution of the    true-up    components, including, in particular, the results of appeals to    the courts regarding rulings obtained to date;           general economic and capital market conditions;           credit availability from financial institutions and other    lenders;           investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;           maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;           market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;    26Table of Contents           market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on    reasonable terms;           our exposure to RRI in connection with its indemnification    obligations arising in connection with its separation from    us; and           provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.     As of December 31, 2007, CenterPoint Houston had    outstanding $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of    general mortgage bonds, including approximately    $527 million held in trust to secure pollution control    bonds for which we are obligated and approximately    $229 million held in trust to secure pollution control    bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is obligated. Additionally,    CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately    $253 million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage    bonds, including approximately $151 million held in trust    to secure certain pollution control bonds for which we are    obligated. CenterPoint Houston may issue additional general    mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% of property    additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately    $2.3 billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general    mortgage bonds in the aggregate could be issued on the basis of    retired bonds and 70% of property additions as of    December 31, 2007. However, CenterPoint Houston has    contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first    mortgage bonds, subject to certain exceptions.     Our current credit ratings are discussed in    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial    Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and    Capital Resources  Future Sources and Uses of    Cash  Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit    Ratings in Item 7 of this report. These credit    ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time    and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn    entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings    are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities.    Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other    rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our    credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our    ability to access capital on acceptable terms. As a    holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on    distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our payment    obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual    restrictions could limit the amount of those    distributions.     We derive all our operating income from, and hold all our assets    through, our subsidiaries. As a result, we will depend on    distributions from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment    obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are separate and    distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us    with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends,    distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of    applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of    dividends, limit our subsidiaries ability to make payments    or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree    to contractual restrictions on their ability to make    distributions.     Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore    the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will    be effectively subordinated to the claims of that    subsidiarys creditors, including trade creditors. In    addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our    rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security    interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness    of the subsidiary senior to that held by us. The    use of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the    normal course of business could result in financial losses that    could negatively impact our results of operations and those of    our subsidiaries.     We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as    swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity,    weather and financial market risks. We and our subsidiaries    could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in    the market values of these contracts, or should a counterparty    fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices    and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of    these financial instruments can involve managements    judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the    underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods    could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.    27Table of ContentsRisks    Common to Our Businesses and Other Risks We are    subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities    arising from environmental laws and regulations.     Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and    regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment, as    discussed in Business  Environmental    Matters in Item 1 of this report. As an owner or    operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas    gathering and processing systems, and electric transmission and    distribution systems, we must comply with these laws and    regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws    and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities    in many ways, such as:           restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;           limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive    areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by    endangered species;           requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions    caused by our operations, or attributable to former    operations; and           enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance    with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and    regulations.     In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend    substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time    to:           construct or acquire new equipment;           acquire permits for facility operations;           modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and           clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and    management facilities and other locations and facilities.     Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a    variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement    measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the    imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders    enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes    impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to    clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been    disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for    neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims    for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the    release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the    environment. Our    insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance    coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact    our results of operations, financial condition and cash    flows.     We currently have general liability and property insurance in    place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we    consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain    limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption    coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future    at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the    insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to,    any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss    or damage without negative impact on our results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows.     In common with other companies in its line of business that    serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have    insurance covering its transmission and distribution system    because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive.    If CenterPoint Houston were to sustain any loss of, or damage    to, its transmission and distribution properties, it may not be    able to recover such loss or damage through a change in its    regulated rates, and any such recovery may not be timely    granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to    restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and    distribution properties without negative impact on its results    of operations, financial condition and cash flows.    28Table of ContentsWe,    CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated    with businesses and assets that we have transferred to    others.     Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could    incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we,    CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and    businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a    predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through    subsidiaries and include:           those transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with    the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial    public offering in 2001; and           those transferred to Texas Genco in connection with its    organization and capitalization.     In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI,    RRI and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with    various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to    them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable    transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,    including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to    liabilities associated with the transferred assets and    businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place    sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for    all liabilities associated with the current and historical    businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those    liabilities arose. If RRI were unable to satisfy a liability    that has been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant    Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability    in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC    could be responsible for satisfying the liability.     Prior to the distribution of our ownership in RRI to our    shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual    obligations of what became RRIs trading subsidiary. Under    the terms of the separation agreement between the companies, RRI    agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to    separation, but at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI    had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure CERC    against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI agreed    to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of CERC,    and undertook to use commercially reasonable efforts to    extinguish the remaining guaranties. In February 2007, we and    CERC made a formal demand on RRI in connection with one of the    two remaining guaranties under procedures provided by the Master    Separation Agreement, dated December 31, 2000, between    Reliant Energy and RRI. That demand sought to resolve a    disagreement with RRI over the amount of security RRI is    obligated to provide with respect to this guaranty. In December    2007, we, CERC and RRI amended the agreement relating to the    security to be provided by RRI for these guaranties, pursuant to    which CERC released the $29.3 million in letters of credit    RRI had provided as security, and RRI agreed to provide cash or    new letters of credit to secure CERC against exposure under the    remaining guaranties as calculated under the new agreement if    and to the extent changes in market conditions exposed CERC to a    risk of loss on those guaranties.     The remaining exposure to CERC under the guaranties relates to    payment of demand charges related to transportation contracts.    The present value of the demand charges under those    transportation contracts, which will be effective until 2018,    was approximately $135 million as of December 31,    2007. RRI continues to meet its obligations under the contracts,    and we believe current market conditions make those contracts    valuable in the near term and that additional security is not    needed at this time. However, changes in market conditions could    affect the value of those contracts. If RRI should fail to    perform its obligations under the contracts or if RRI should    fail to provide security in the event market conditions change    adversely, our exposure to the counterparty under the guaranty    could exceed the security provided by RRI.     RRIs unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment    grade. If RRI were unable to meet its obligations, it would need    to consider, among various options, restructuring under the    bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI might not honor its    indemnification obligations and claims by RRIs creditors    might be made against us as its former owner.     Reliant Energy and RRI are named as defendants in a number of    lawsuits arising out of energy sales in California and other    markets and financial reporting matters. Although these matters    relate to the business and operations of RRI, claims against    Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include the effect    of RRIs financial results on Reliant Energys    historical financial statements and liability of Reliant Energy    as a controlling shareholder of RRI. We or CenterPoint Houston    could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits    were    29Table of Contents    successfully asserted against us or CenterPoint Houston and    indemnification from RRI were determined to be unavailable or if    RRI were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with    respect to those claims.     In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas    Genco, Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the    electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it.    Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable    transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,    including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities    associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many    cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint    Houston and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third    parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were    intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on    Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated    with the current and historical businesses and operations of    Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. In    connection with the sale of Texas Gencos fossil generation    assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC,    the separation agreement we entered into with Texas Genco in    connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas    Genco was amended to provide that all of Texas Gencos    rights and obligations under the separation agreement relating    to its fossil generation assets, including Texas Gencos    obligation to indemnify us with respect to liabilities    associated with the fossil generation assets and related    business, were assigned to and assumed by Texas Genco LLC. In    addition, under the amended separation agreement, Texas Genco is    no longer liable for, and we have assumed and agreed to    indemnify Texas Genco LLC against, liabilities that Texas Genco    originally assumed in connection with its organization to the    extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are    covered by certain insurance policies or other similar    agreements held by us. If Texas Genco or Texas Genco LLC were    unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or    indemnified against, and provided Reliant Energy had not been    released from the liability in connection with the transfer,    CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for satisfying the    liability.     We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous    others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a large number of    individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Most    claimants in such litigation have been workers who participated    in construction of various industrial facilities, including    power plants. Some of the claimants have worked at locations we    own, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously    owned by our subsidiaries but currently owned by Texas Genco    LLC, which is now known as NRG Texas LP. We anticipate that    additional claims like those received may be asserted in the    future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation    of the generating business from us and its sale to Texas Genco    LLC, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from    claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by    Texas Genco LLC and its successor, but we have agreed to    continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by    insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the    costs of such defense by Texas Genco LLC. "
1,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2007-02-28,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     We are a holding company that conducts all of our business    operations through subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston    and CERC. The following, along with any additional legal    proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in    Item 3 of this report, summarizes the principal risk    factors associated with the businesses conducted by each of    these subsidiaries: Risk    Factors Affecting Our Electric Transmission &    Distribution Business CenterPoint    Houston may not be successful in ultimately recovering the full    value of its    true-up    components, which could result in the elimination of certain tax    benefits and could have an adverse impact on CenterPoint    Houstons results of operations, financial condition and    cash flows.     In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its    true-up    application with the Texas Utility Commission, requesting    recovery of $3.7 billion, excluding interest, as allowed    under the Texas electric restructuring law. In December 2004,    the Texas Utility Commission issued its final order    (True-Up    Order) allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a    true-up    balance of approximately $2.3 billion, which included    interest through August 31, 2004, and providing for    adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on    the balance until recovery, the principal portion of additional    excess mitigation credits returned to customers after    August 31, 2004 and certain other matters. CenterPoint    Houston and other parties filed appeals of the    True-Up    Order to a district court in Travis County, Texas. In August    2005, the court issued its final judgment on the various    appeals. In its judgment, the court affirmed most aspects of the    True-Up    Order, but reversed two of the Texas Utility Commissions    rulings. The judgment would have the effect of restoring    approximately $650 million, plus interest, of the    $1.7 billion the Texas Utility Commission had disallowed    from CenterPoint Houstons initial request. CenterPoint    Houston and other parties appealed the district courts    judgment. Oral arguments before the Texas 3rd Court of    Appeals were held in January 2007, but a decision is not    expected for several months. No amounts related to the district    courts judgment have been recorded in our consolidated    financial statements.     Among the issues raised in CenterPoint Houstons appeal of    the True-Up    Order is the Texas Utility Commissions reduction of    CenterPoint Houstons stranded cost recovery by    approximately $146 million for the present value of certain    deferred tax benefits associated with its former electric    generation assets. Such reduction was considered in our    recording of an after-tax extraordinary loss of    $977 million in the last half of 2004. We believe that the    Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposed regulations    issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in March 2003    related to those tax benefits. Those proposed regulations would    have allowed utilities owning assets that were deregulated    before March 4, 2003 to make a retroactive election to pass    the benefits of Accumulated Deferred Investment Tax Credits    (ADITC) and Excess Deferred Federal Income Taxes (EDFIT) back to    customers. However, in December 2005, the IRS withdrew those    proposed normalization regulations and issued new proposed    regulations that do not include the provision allowing a    retroactive election to pass the tax benefits back to customers.    In a May 2006 Private Letter Ruling (PLR) issued to a Texas    utility on facts similar to CenterPoint Houstons, the IRS,    without referencing its proposed regulations, ruled that a    normalization violation would occur if ADITC and EDFIT were    required to be returned to customers. CenterPoint Houston has    requested a PLR asking the IRS whether the Texas Utility    Commissions order reducing CenterPoint Houstons    stranded cost recovery by $146 million for ADITC and EDFIT    would cause a normalization violation. If the IRS determines    that such reduction would cause a normalization violation with    respect to the ADITC and the Texas Utility Commissions    order relating to such reduction is not reversed or otherwise    modified, the IRS could require us to pay an amount equal to    CenterPoint Houstons unamortized ADITC balance as of the    date that the normalization violation is deemed to have    occurred. In addition, if a normalization violation with respect    to EDFIT is deemed to have occurred and the Texas Utility    Commissions order relating to such reduction is not    reversed or otherwise modified, the IRS could deny CenterPoint    Houston the ability to elect accelerated tax depreciation    benefits beginning in the taxable year that the normalization    violation is deemed to have occurred. If a normalization    violation should ultimately be found to exist, it could have an    adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition    and cash flows. However, we and CenterPoint Houston are    vigorously pursuing the appeal of this issue and will seek other    relief from the Texas Utility Commission to avoid a    normalization violation. The Texas Utility Commission has not    previously required a company subject to its jurisdiction to    take action that would result in a normalization violation.    24Table of Contents CenterPoint    Houstons receivables are concentrated in a small number of    REPs, and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect    CenterPoint Houstons cash flows, financial condition and    results of operations.     CenterPoint Houstons receivables from the distribution of    electricity are collected from REPs that supply the electricity    CenterPoint Houston distributes to their customers. Currently,    CenterPoint Houston does business with 68 REPs. Adverse economic    conditions, structural problems in the market served by ERCOT or    financial difficulties of one or more REPs could impair the    ability of these retail providers to pay for CenterPoint    Houstons services or could cause them to delay such    payments. CenterPoint Houston depends on these REPs to remit    payments on a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions    require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort    if a retail electric provider cannot make timely payments.    Reliant Energy, Inc. (RRI), through its subsidiaries, is    CenterPoint Houstons largest customer. Approximately 53%    of CenterPoint Houstons $140 million in billed    receivables from REPs at December 31, 2006 was owed by    subsidiaries of RRI. Any delay or default in payment could    adversely affect CenterPoint Houstons cash flows,    financial condition and results of operations. Rate    regulation of CenterPoint Houstons business may delay or    deny CenterPoint Houstons ability to earn a reasonable    return and fully recover its costs.     CenterPoint Houstons rates are regulated by certain    municipalities and the Texas Utility Commission based on an    analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test    year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed to    charge may not match its expenses at any given time. In this    connection, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement discussed in    Business  Regulation  State and    Local Regulation  Electric Transmission &    Distribution  CenterPoint Houston Rate Case in    Item 1 of this report, until June 30, 2010,    CenterPoint Houston is limited in its ability to request rate    relief. The regulatory process by which rates are determined may    not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of    CenterPoint Houstons costs and enable CenterPoint Houston    to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital. Disruptions    at power generation facilities owned by third parties could    interrupt CenterPoint Houstons sales of transmission and    distribution services.     CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of    REPs electric power that the REPs obtain from power generation    facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does not    own or operate any power generation facilities. If power    generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is    inadequate, CenterPoint Houstons sales of transmission and    distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and its    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be    adversely affected. CenterPoint    Houstons revenues and results of operations are    seasonal.     A significant portion of CenterPoint Houstons revenues is    derived from rates that it collects from each retail electric    provider based on the amount of electricity it distributes on    behalf of such retail electric provider. Thus, CenterPoint    Houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to    seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity    usage, with revenues being higher during the warmer months. Risk    Factors Affecting Our Natural Gas Distribution, Competitive    Natural Gas Sales and Services, Interstate Pipelines and Field    Services Businesses Rate    regulation of CERCs business may delay or deny CERCs    ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its    costs.     CERCs rates for its local distribution companies are    regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions, and    for its interstate pipelines by the FERC, based on an analysis    of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year. Thus,    the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its    expenses at any given time. The regulatory process in which    rates are determined may not always result in rates that will    produce full recovery of CERCs costs and enable CERC to    earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.    25Table of Contents CERCs    businesses must compete with alternative energy sources, which    could result in CERC marketing less natural gas, and its    interstate pipelines and field services businesses must compete    directly with others in the transportation, storage, gathering,    treating and processing of natural gas, which could lead to    lower prices, either of which could have an adverse impact on    CERCs results of operations, financial condition and cash    flows.     CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as    electricity and other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate    pipelines, other natural gas distributors and marketers also    compete directly with CERC for natural gas sales to end-users.    In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting    interstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these    pipelines may be able to bypass CERCs facilities and    market, sell    and/or    transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial    customers. Any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed,    sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition may have    an adverse impact on CERCs results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows.     CERCs two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems    compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and    gathering systems in the transportation and storage of natural    gas. The principal elements of competition are rates, terms of    service, and flexibility and reliability of service. They also    compete indirectly with other forms of energy, including    electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor    is price. The actions of CERCs competitors could lead to    lower prices, which may have an adverse impact on CERCs    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. CERCs    natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and    services businesses are subject to fluctuations in natural gas    pricing levels, which could affect the ability of CERCs    suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise    adversely affect CERCs liquidity.     CERC is subject to risk associated with increases in the price    of natural gas. Increases in natural gas prices might affect    CERCs ability to collect balances due from its customers    and, on the regulated side, could create the potential for    uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels    built into CERCs tariff rates. In addition, a sustained    period of high natural gas prices could apply downward demand    pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which CERC    operates and increase the risk that CERCs suppliers or    customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations.    Additionally, increasing natural gas prices could create the    need for CERC to provide collateral in order to purchase natural    gas. If    CERC were to fail to renegotiate a contract with one of its    significant pipeline customers or if CERC renegotiates the    contract on less favorable terms, there could be an adverse    impact on its operations.     Since October 31, 2006, CERCs contract with Laclede    Gas Company, one of its pipeline customers, has been terminable    upon one years prior notice. CERC has not received a    termination notice and is currently negotiating a long-term    contract with Laclede. If Laclede were to terminate this    contract or if CERC were to renegotiate this contract at rates    substantially lower than the rates provided in the current    contract, there could be an adverse effect on CERCs    results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A    decline in CERCs credit rating could result in CERCs    having to provide collateral in order to purchase    gas.     If CERCs credit rating were to decline, it might be    required to post cash collateral in order to purchase natural    gas. If a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash    collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC was    experiencing significant working capital requirements or    otherwise lacked liquidity, CERC might be unable to obtain the    necessary natural gas to meet its obligations to customers, and    its results of operations, financial condition and cash flows    would be adversely affected. The    revenues and results of operations of CERCs interstate    pipelines and field services businesses are subject to    fluctuations in the supply of natural gas.     CERCs interstate pipelines and field services businesses    largely rely on natural gas sourced in the various supply basins    located in the Mid-continent region of the United States. To the    extent the availability of this supply is    26Table of Contents    substantially reduced, it could have an adverse effect on    CERCs results of operations, financial condition and cash    flows. CERCs    revenues and results of operations are seasonal.     A substantial portion of CERCs revenues is derived from    natural gas sales and transportation. Thus, CERCs revenues    and results of operations are subject to seasonality, weather    conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, with revenues    being higher during the winter months. The    actual construction costs of proposed pipelines and related    compression facilities may be significantly higher than    CERCs current estimates.     Subsidiaries of CERC Corp. are involved in significant pipeline    construction projects. The construction of new pipelines and    related compression facilities requires the expenditure of    significant amounts of capital, which may exceed CERCs    estimates. If CERC undertakes these projects, they may not be    completed at the budgeted cost, on schedule or at all. The    construction of new pipeline or compression facilities is    subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs    of equipment and materials such as steel and nickel, labor    shortages or delays, inflation or other factors, which could be    material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is    typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from    various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the    projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or    conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a    project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion    schedule    and/or    increase its anticipated cost. As a result, there is the risk    that the new facilities may not be able to achieve CERCs    expected investment return, which could adversely affect    CERCs financial condition, results of operations or cash    flows. The    states in which CERC provides regulated local gas distribution    may, either through legislation or rules, adopt restrictions    similar to or broader than those under the 1935 Act regarding    organization, financing and affiliate transactions that could    have significant adverse impacts on CERCs ability to    operate.     In Arkansas, the APSC in December 2006 adopted rules governing    affiliate transactions involving public utilities operating in    Arkansas. The rules treat as affiliate transactions all    transactions between CERCs Arkansas utility operations and    other divisions of CERC, as well as transactions between the    Arkansas utility operations and affiliates of CERC. All such    affiliate transactions are required to be priced under an    asymmetrical pricing formula under which the Arkansas utility    operations would benefit from any difference between the cost of    providing goods and services to or from the Arkansas utility    operations and the market value of those goods or services.    Additionally, the Arkansas utility operations are not permitted    to participate in any financing other than to finance retail    utility operations in Arkansas, which would preclude    continuation of existing financing arrangements in which CERC    finances its divisions and subsidiaries, including its Arkansas    utility operations.     Although the Arkansas rules are now in effect, CERC and other    gas and electric utilities operating in Arkansas sought    reconsideration of the rules by the APSC. In February 2007, the    APSC granted that reconsideration and suspended operation of the    rules in order to permit time for additional consideration. If    the rules are not significantly modified on reconsideration,    CERC would be entitled to seek judicial review. In adopting the    rules, the APSC indicated that affiliate transactions and    financial arrangements currently in effect will be deemed in    compliance until December 19, 2007, and that utilities may    seek waivers of specific provisions of the rules. If the rules    ultimately become effective as presently adopted, CERC would    need to seek waivers from certain provisions of the rules or    would be required to make significant modifications to existing    practices, which could include the formation of and transfer of    assets to subsidiaries.     In Minnesota, a bill has been introduced during the current    session of the legislature that would create a regulatory scheme    for public utility holding companies like CenterPoint and their    public utility operations in Minnesota. The proposed legislation    would restrict financing activities, affiliate arrangements    between the Minnesota utility operations and the holding company    and other utility and non-utility operations within the holding    company and acquisitions and divestitures. In addition, the bill    would require prior MPUC approval of    27Table of Contents    dividends paid by the holding company, in addition to dividends    paid by utility subsidiaries, and would limit the level of    non-utility investments of the holding company.     If either or both of these regulatory frameworks become    effective, they could have adverse impacts on CERCs    ability to operate and provide cost-effective utility service.    In addition, if more than one state adopts restrictions like    those proposed in Arkansas and Minnesota, it may be difficult    for CenterPoint and CERC to comply with competing regulatory    requirements. Risk    Factors Associated with Our Consolidated Financial    Condition If we    are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms, our    ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be    limited.     As of December 31, 2006, we had $9.0 billion of    outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, which includes    $2.4 billion of non-recourse transition bonds. As of    December 31, 2006, approximately $875 million    principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through    2009. This amount excludes principal repayments of approximately    $481 million on transition bonds, for which a dedicated    revenue stream exists. In addition, we have cash settlement    obligations with respect to $575 million of outstanding    3.75% convertible notes on which holders could exercise    their conversion rights during the first quarter of 2007 and in    subsequent quarters in which our common stock price causes such    notes to be convertible. Our future financing activities may    depend, at least in part, on:           the timing and amount of our recovery of the    true-up    components, including, in particular, the results of appeals to    the courts of determinations on rulings obtained to date;           general economic and capital market conditions;           credit availability from financial institutions and other    lenders;           investor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;           maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;           market expectations regarding our future earnings and cash flows;           market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on    reasonable terms;           our exposure to RRI in connection with its indemnification    obligations arising in connection with its separation from    us; and           provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.     As of December 31, 2006, CenterPoint Houston had    outstanding $2.0 billion aggregate principal amount of    general mortgage bonds, including approximately    $527 million held in trust to secure pollution control    bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated and    approximately $229 million held in trust to secure    pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston is    obligated. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding    approximately $253 million aggregate principal amount of    first mortgage bonds, including approximately $151 million    held in trust to secure certain pollution control bonds for    which CenterPoint Energy is obligated. CenterPoint Houston may    issue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired    bonds, 70% of property additions or cash deposited with the    trustee. Approximately $2.2 billion of additional first    mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds in the aggregate could    be issued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property    additions as of December 31, 2006. However, CenterPoint    Houston is contractually prohibited, subject to certain    exceptions, from issuing additional first mortgage bonds.     Our current credit ratings are discussed in    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial    Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and    Capital Resources  Future Sources and Uses of    Cash  Impact on Liquidity of a Downgrade in Credit    Ratings in Item 7 of this report. These credit    ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time    and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn    entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings    are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities.    Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other    rating. Any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our    credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our    ability to access capital on acceptable terms.    28Table of Contents As a    holding company with no operations of our own, we will depend on    distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our payment    obligations, and provisions of applicable law or contractual    restrictions could limit the amount of those    distributions.     We derive all our operating income from, and hold all our assets    through, our subsidiaries. As a result, we will depend on    distributions from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment    obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are separate and    distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us    with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends,    distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of    applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of    dividends, limit our subsidiaries ability to make payments    or other distributions to us, and our subsidiaries could agree    to contractual restrictions on their ability to make    distributions.     Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore    the right of our creditors to participate in those assets, will    be effectively subordinated to the claims of that    subsidiarys creditors, including trade creditors. In    addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our    rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security    interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness    of the subsidiary senior to that held by us. The    use of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the    normal course of business could result in financial losses that    could negatively impact our results of operations and those of    our subsidiaries.     We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as    swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage our commodity    and financial market risks. We and our subsidiaries could    recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the    market values of these contracts, or should a counterparty fail    to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and    pricing information from external sources, the valuation of    these financial instruments can involve managements    judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the    underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods    could affect the reported fair value of these contracts. Risks    Common to Our Businesses and Other Risks We are    subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities    arising from environmental laws and regulations.     Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and    regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment, as    discussed in Business  Environmental    Matters in Item 1 of this report. As an owner or    operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas    gathering and processing systems, and electric transmission and    distribution systems, we must comply with these laws and    regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws    and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities    in many ways, such as:           restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wastes;           limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive    areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by    endangered species;           requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions    caused by our operations, or attributable to former    operations; and           enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance    with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and    regulations.     In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spend    substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time    to:           construct or acquire new equipment;           acquire permits for facility operations;           modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and           clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and    management facilities and other locations and facilities.    29Table of Contents     Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a    variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement    measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the    imposition of remedial actions, and the issuance of orders    enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes    impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to    clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been    disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for    neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims    for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the    release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the    environment. Our    insurance coverage may not be sufficient. Insufficient insurance    coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact    our results of operations, financial condition and cash    flows.     We currently have general liability and property insurance in    place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we    consider appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain    limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption    coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future    at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the    insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to,    any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss    or damage without negative impact on our results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows.     In common with other companies in its line of business that    serve coastal regions, CenterPoint Houston does not have    insurance covering its transmission and distribution system    because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be cost prohibitive.    If CenterPoint Houston were to sustain any loss of, or damage    to, its transmission and distribution properties, it may not be    able to recover such loss or damage through a change in its    regulated rates, and any such recovery may not be timely    granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able to    restore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and    distribution properties without negative impact on its results    of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We,    CenterPoint Houston and CERC could incur liabilities associated    with businesses and assets that we have transferred to    others.     Under some circumstances, we, CenterPoint Houston and CERC could    incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we,    CenterPoint Houston and CERC no longer own. These assets and    businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy, a    predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through    subsidiaries and include:           those transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with    the organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial    public offering in 2001; and           those transferred to Texas Genco in connection with its    organization and capitalization.     In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI,    RRI and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with    various assets and businesses Reliant Energy transferred to    them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable    transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,    including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to    liabilities associated with the transferred assets and    businesses. These indemnity provisions were intended to place    sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries for    all liabilities associated with the current and historical    businesses and operations of RRI, regardless of the time those    liabilities arose. If RRI were unable to satisfy a liability    that has been so assumed in circumstances in which Reliant    Energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability    in connection with the transfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC    could be responsible for satisfying the liability.     Prior to our distribution of our ownership in RRI to our    shareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual    obligations of what became RRIs trading subsidiary. Under    the terms of the separation agreement between the companies, RRI    agreed to extinguish all such guaranty obligations prior to    separation, but at the time of separation in September 2002, RRI    had been unable to extinguish all obligations. To secure us and    CERC against obligations under the remaining guaranties, RRI    agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for the benefit of    CERC and us, and undertook to use commercially reasonable    efforts to extinguish the remaining guaranties. CERC currently    holds letters of credit in the amount of $33.3 million    issued on behalf of RRI against guaranties that have not been    released. Our current exposure under the guaranties relates to    CERCs guaranty of the payment by RRI of demand    30Table of Contents    charges related to transportation contracts with one    counterparty. The demand charges are approximately    $53 million per year through 2015, $49 million in    2016, $38 million in 2017 and $13 million in 2018. RRI    continues to meet its obligations under the transportation    contracts, and we believe current market conditions make those    contracts valuable for transportation services in the near term.    However, changes in market conditions could affect the value of    those contracts. If RRI should fail to perform its obligations    under the transportation contracts, our exposure to the    counterparty under the guaranty could exceed the security    provided by RRI. We have requested RRI to increase the amount of    its existing letters of credit or, in the alternative, to obtain    a release of CERCs obligations under the guaranty. In June    2006, the RRI trading subsidiary and CERC jointly filed a    complaint at the FERC against the counterparty on the CERC    guaranty. In the complaint, the RRI trading subsidiary seeks a    determination by the FERC that the security demanded by the    counterparty exceeds the level permitted by the FERCs    policies. The complaint asks the FERC to require the    counterparty to release CERC from its guaranty obligation and,    in its place, accept (i) a guaranty from RRI of the    obligations of the RRI trading subsidiary, and (ii) letters    of credit limited to (A) one year of demand charges for a    transportation agreement related to a 2003 expansion of the    counterpartys pipeline, and (B) three months of    demand charges for three other transportation agreements held by    the RRI trading subsidiary. The counterparty has argued that the    amount of the guaranty does not violate the FERCs policies    and that the proposed substitution of credit support is not    authorized under the counterpartys financing documents or    required by the FERCs policy. The parties have now    completed their submissions to FERC regarding the complaint. We    cannot predict what action the FERC may take on the complaint or    when the FERC may rule. In addition to the FERC proceeding, in    February 2007 CenterPoint and CERC made a formal demand on RRI    under procedures provided for by the Master Separation    Agreement, dated as of December 31, 2000, between Reliant    Energy, Incorporated and Reliant Resources, Inc. That demand    seeks to resolve the disagreement with RRI over the amount of    security RRI is obligated to provide with respect to this    guaranty. It is possible that this demand could lead to an    arbitration proceeding between the companies, but when and on    what terms the disagreement with RRI will ultimately be resolved    cannot be predicted.     RRIs unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment    grade. If RRI were unable to meet its obligations, it would need    to consider, among various options, restructuring under the    bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI might not honor its    indemnification obligations and claims by RRIs creditors    might be made against us as its former owner.     Reliant Energy and RRI are named as defendants in a number of    lawsuits arising out of energy sales in California and other    markets and financial reporting matters. Although these matters    relate to the business and operations of RRI, claims against    Reliant Energy have been made on grounds that include the effect    of RRIs financial results on Reliant Energys    historical financial statements and liability of Reliant Energy    as a controlling shareholder of RRI. We or CenterPoint Houston    could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits    were successfully asserted against us or CenterPoint Houston and    indemnification from RRI were determined to be unavailable or if    RRI were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with    respect to those claims.     In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas    Genco, Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the    electric generation assets Reliant Energy transferred to it.    Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, and cause the applicable    transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,    including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilities    associated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many    cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint    Houston and CenterPoint Houston was not released by third    parties from these liabilities. The indemnity provisions were    intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on    Texas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated    with the current and historical businesses and operations of    Texas Genco, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. In    connection with the sale of Texas Gencos fossil generation    assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC,    the separation agreement we entered into with Texas Genco in    connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas    Genco was amended to provide that all of Texas Gencos    rights and obligations under the separation agreement relating    to its fossil generation assets, including Texas Gencos    obligation to indemnify us with respect to liabilities    associated with the fossil generation assets and related    business, were assigned to and assumed by Texas Genco LLC. In    addition, under the amended separation agreement, Texas Genco is    no longer liable for, and we have assumed and agreed to    indemnify Texas Genco LLC against, liabilities that Texas Genco    originally assumed in connection with its organization to the    extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities are    covered by certain insurance policies or    31Table of Contents    other similar agreements held by us. If Texas Genco or Texas    Genco LLC were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so    assumed or indemnified against, and provided Reliant Energy had    not been released from the liability in connection with the    transfer, CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for    satisfying the liability.     We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous    others, as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a large number of    individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos. Most    claimants in such litigation have been workers who participated    in construction of various industrial facilities, including    power plants. Some of the claimants have worked at locations we    own, but most existing claims relate to facilities previously    owned by our subsidiaries but currently owned by Texas Genco    LLC, which is now known as NRG Texas LP. We anticipate that    additional claims like those received may be asserted in the    future. Under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation    of the generating business from us and its sale to Texas Genco    LLC, ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from    claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by    Texas Genco LLC and its successor, but we have agreed to    continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by    insurance maintained by us, subject to reimbursement of the    costs of such defense by Texas Genco LLC. "
13,CNP,CENTERPOINT ENERGY INC,2006-03-16,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS     We are a holding company that conducts all of our business operationsthrough subsidiaries, primarily CenterPoint Houston and CERC. The followingsummarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conductedby each of these subsidiaries:RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS  CENTERPOINT HOUSTON MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN ULTIMATELY RECOVERING THE FULL  VALUE OF ITS TRUE-UP COMPONENTS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF  CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS AND COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON CENTERPOINT HOUSTON'S  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS.     In March 2004, CenterPoint Houston filed its true-up application with theTexas Utility Commission, requesting recovery of $3.7 billion, excludinginterest. In December 2004, the Texas Utility Commission issued its final order(True-Up Order) allowing CenterPoint Houston to recover a true-up balance ofapproximately $2.3 billion, which included interest through August 31, 2004, andproviding for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest onthe balance until recovery, the principal portion of additional excessmitigation credits returned to customers after August 31, 2004 and certain othermatters. CenterPoint Houston and other parties filed appeals of the True-UpOrder to a district court in Travis County, Texas. In August 2005, the courtissued its final judgment on the various appeals. In its judgment, the courtaffirmed most aspects of the True-Up Order, but reversed two of the TexasUtility Commission's rulings. The judgment would have the effect of restoringapproximately $650 million, plus interest, of the $1.7 billion the Texas UtilityCommission had disallowed from CenterPoint Houston's initial request. First, thecourt reversed the Texas Utility Commission's decision to prohibit CenterPointHouston from recovering $180 million in credits through August 2004 thatCenterPoint Houston was ordered to provide to retail electric providers as aresult of an inaccurate stranded cost estimate made by the Texas UtilityCommission in 2000. Additional credits of approximately $30 million were paidafter August 2004. Second, the court reversed the Texas Utility Commission'sdisallowance of $440 million in transition costs which are recoverable under theTexas Utility Commission's regulations. CenterPoint Houston and other partiesappealed the district court decisions. Briefs have been filed with the 3rd Courtof Appeals in Austin but oral argument has not yet been scheduled. No predictioncan be made as to the ultimate outcome or timing of such appeals. Additionally,if the amount of the true-up balance is reduced on appeal to below the amountrecovered through the issuance of transition bonds and under the CTC, while theamount of transition bonds outstanding would not be reduced, CenterPoint Houstonwould be required to refund the over recovery to its customers.     Among the issues raised in our appeal of the True-Up Order is the TexasUtility Commission's reduction of our stranded cost recovery by approximately$146 million for the present value of certain deferred tax benefits associatedwith our former Texas Genco assets. Such reduction was considered in ourrecording of an after-tax extraordinary loss of $977 million in the last half of2004. We believe that the Texas Utility Commission based its order on proposedregulations issued by the IRS in March 2003 related to those tax benefits. Thoseproposed regulations would have allowed utilities which were deregulated beforeMarch 4, 2003 to make a retroactive election to pass the benefits of ADITC andEDFIT back to customers. However, in December 2005, the IRS withdrew thoseproposed normalization regulations and issued new proposed regulations that donot include the provision allowing a retroactive election to pass the taxbenefits back to customers. If the December 2005 proposed regulations becomeeffective and if the Texas Utility Commission's order on this issue is notreversed on appeal or the amount of the tax benefits is not otherwise restoredby the Texas Utility Commission, the IRS is likely to consider that a""normalization violation"" has occurred. If so, the IRS could require us to payan amount equal to CenterPoint Houston's unamortized ADITC balance as of thedate that the normalization violation was deemed to have occurred. In addition,if a normalization violation is deemed to have occurred, the IRS could also denyCenterPoint Houston the ability to elect accelerated depreciation benefits. If anormalization violation should ultimately be found to exist, it could have anadverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The Texas Utility Commission has not previously required a company subject toits jurisdiction to take action that would result in a normalization violation.                                        21  CENTERPOINT HOUSTON'S RECEIVABLES ARE CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF RETAIL  ELECTRIC PROVIDERS, AND ANY DELAY OR DEFAULT IN PAYMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT  CENTERPOINT HOUSTON'S CASH FLOWS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS.     CenterPoint Houston's receivables from the distribution of electricity arecollected from retail electric providers that supply the electricity CenterPointHouston distributes to their customers. Currently, CenterPoint Houston doesbusiness with 66 retail electric providers. Adverse economic conditions,structural problems in the market served by the Electric Reliability Council ofTexas, Inc. (ERCOT) or financial difficulties of one or more retail electricproviders could impair the ability of these retail providers to pay forCenterPoint Houston's services or could cause them to delay such payments.CenterPoint Houston depends on these retail electric providers to remit paymentson a timely basis. Applicable regulatory provisions require that customers beshifted to a provider of last resort if a retail electric provider cannot maketimely payments. RRI, through its subsidiaries, is CenterPoint Houston's largestcustomer. Approximately 56% of CenterPoint Houston's $127 million in billedreceivables from retail electric providers at December 31, 2005 was owed bysubsidiaries of RRI. Any delay or default in payment could adversely affectCenterPoint Houston's cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.  RATE REGULATION OF CENTERPOINT HOUSTON'S BUSINESS MAY DELAY OR DENY  CENTERPOINT HOUSTON'S ABILITY TO EARN A REASONABLE RETURN AND FULLY RECOVER  ITS COSTS.     CenterPoint Houston's rates are regulated by certain municipalities and theTexas Utility Commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and itsexpenses in a test year. Thus, the rates that CenterPoint Houston is allowed tocharge may not match its expenses at any given time. The regulatory process bywhich rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce fullrecovery of CenterPoint Houston's costs and enable CenterPoint Houston to earn areasonable return on its invested capital.  DISRUPTIONS AT POWER GENERATION FACILITIES OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES COULD  INTERRUPT CENTERPOINT HOUSTON'S SALES OF TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION  SERVICES.     CenterPoint Houston transmits and distributes to customers of retailelectric providers electric power that the retail electric providers obtain frompower generation facilities owned by third parties. CenterPoint Houston does notown or operate any power generation facilities. If power generation is disruptedor if power generation capacity is inadequate, CenterPoint Houston's sales oftransmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted, and itsresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adverselyaffected.  CENTERPOINT HOUSTON'S REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE SEASONAL.     A significant portion of CenterPoint Houston's revenues is derived fromrates that it collects from each retail electric provider based on the amount ofelectricity it distributes on behalf of such retail electric provider. Thus,CenterPoint Houston's revenues and results of operations are subject toseasonality, weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage, withrevenues being higher during the warmer months.RISK FACTORS AFFECTING OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION, COMPETITIVE NATURAL GASSALES AND SERVICES AND PIPELINES AND FIELD SERVICES BUSINESSES  RATE REGULATION OF CERC'S BUSINESS MAY DELAY OR DENY CERC'S ABILITY TO EARN A  REASONABLE RETURN AND FULLY RECOVER ITS COSTS.     CERC's rates for its local distribution companies are regulated by certainmunicipalities and state commissions, and for its interstate pipelines by theFERC, based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a testyear. Thus, the rates that CERC is allowed to charge may not match its expensesat any given time. The regulatory process in which rates are determined may notalways result in rates that will produce full recovery of CERC's costs andenable CERC to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.                                        22  CERC'S BUSINESSES MUST COMPETE WITH ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES, WHICH COULD  LEAD TO LESS NATURAL GAS BEING MARKETED, AND ITS PIPELINES AND FIELD SERVICES  BUSINESSES MUST COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH OTHERS IN THE TRANSPORTATION, STORAGE,  GATHERING, TREATING AND PROCESSING OF NATURAL GAS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO LOWER  PRICES, EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON CERC'S RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS.     CERC competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricityand other fuel sources. In some areas, intrastate pipelines, other natural gasdistributors and marketers also compete directly with CERC for natural gas salesto end-users. In addition, as a result of federal regulatory changes affectinginterstate pipelines, natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may beable to bypass CERC's facilities and market, sell and/or transport natural gasdirectly to commercial and industrial customers. Any reduction in the amount ofnatural gas marketed, sold or transported by CERC as a result of competition mayhave an adverse impact on CERC's results of operations, financial condition andcash flows.     CERC's two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete withother interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in thetransportation and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competitionare rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. Theyalso compete indirectly with other forms of energy, including electricity, coaland fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price. The actions of CERC'scompetitors could lead to lower prices, which may have an adverse impact onCERC's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  CERC'S NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION AND COMPETITIVE NATURAL GAS SALES AND SERVICES  BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN NATURAL GAS PRICING LEVELS, WHICH  COULD AFFECT THE ABILITY OF CERC'S SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS TO MEET THEIR  OBLIGATIONS OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT CERC'S LIQUIDITY.     CERC is subject to risk associated with increases in the price of naturalgas, which has been the trend in recent years. Increases in natural gas pricesmight affect CERC's ability to collect balances due from its customers and, onthe regulated side, could create the potential for uncollectible accountsexpense to exceed the recoverable levels built into CERC's tariff rates. Inaddition, a sustained period of high natural gas prices could apply downwarddemand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which CERC operatesand increase the risk that CERC's suppliers or customers fail or are unable tomeet their obligations. Additionally, increasing gas prices could create theneed for CERC to provide collateral in order to purchase gas.  IF CERC WERE TO FAIL TO EXTEND A CONTRACT WITH ONE OF ITS SIGNIFICANT PIPELINE  CUSTOMERS, THERE COULD BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS OPERATIONS.     CERC's contract with Laclede Gas Company, one of its pipeline's customers,is currently scheduled to expire in 2007. To the extent the pipeline is unableto extend this contract or the contract is renegotiated at rates substantiallyless than the rates provided in the current contract, there could be an adverseeffect on CERC's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  A DECLINE IN CERC'S CREDIT RATING COULD RESULT IN CERC'S HAVING TO PROVIDE  COLLATERAL IN ORDER TO PURCHASE GAS.     If CERC's credit rating were to decline, it might be required to post cashcollateral in order to purchase natural gas. If a credit rating downgrade andthe resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when CERC wasexperiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lackedliquidity, CERC might be unable to obtain the necessary natural gas to meet itsobligations to customers, and its results of operations, financial condition andcash flows would be adversely affected.  CERC'S PIPELINES' AND FIELD SERVICES' BUSINESS REVENUES AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SUPPLY OF GAS.     CERC's pipelines and field services business largely relies on gas sourcedin the various supply basins located in the Midcontinent region of the UnitedStates. To the extent the availability of this supply is                                        23substantially reduced, it could have an adverse effect on CERC's results ofoperations, financial condition and cash flows.  CERC'S REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE SEASONAL.     A substantial portion of CERC's revenues is derived from natural gas salesand transportation. Thus, CERC's revenues and results of operations are subjectto seasonality, weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage, withrevenues being higher during the winter months.RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ARRANGE FUTURE FINANCINGS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OUR ABILITY  TO REFINANCE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS COULD BE LIMITED.     As of December 31, 2005, we had $8.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness ona consolidated basis, which includes $2.5 billion of non-recourse transitionbonds. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $665 million principal amount ofthis debt must be paid through 2008. This amount excludes principal repaymentsof approximately $379 million on transition bonds, for which a dedicated revenuestream exists. In addition, we have $830 million of outstanding convertiblenotes on which holders could exercise their ""put"" rights during this period. Ourfuture financing activities may depend, at least in part, on:     - the timing and amount of our recovery of the true-up components,       including, in particular, the results of appeals to the courts of       determinations on rulings obtained to date;     - general economic and capital market conditions;     - credit availability from financial institutions and other lenders;     - investor confidence in us and the market in which we operate;     - maintenance of acceptable credit ratings;     - market expectations regarding our future earnings and probable cash       flows;     - market perceptions of our ability to access capital markets on reasonable       terms;     - our exposure to RRI in connection with its indemnification obligations       arising in connection with its separation from us; and     - provisions of relevant tax and securities laws.     As of December 31, 2005, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding $2.0 billionaggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds under the General Mortgage,including approximately $527 million held in trust to secure pollution controlbonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated and approximately $229 millionheld in trust to secure pollution control bonds for which CenterPoint Houston isobligated. Additionally, CenterPoint Houston had outstanding approximately $253million aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds under the Mortgage,including approximately $151 million held in trust to secure certain pollutioncontrol bonds for which CenterPoint Energy is obligated. CenterPoint Houston mayissue additional general mortgage bonds on the basis of retired bonds, 70% ofproperty additions or cash deposited with the trustee. Approximately $2.0billion of additional first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds could beissued on the basis of retired bonds and 70% of property additions as ofDecember 31, 2005. However, CenterPoint Houston is contractually prohibited,subject to certain exceptions, from issuing additional first mortgage bonds.     Our current credit ratings are discussed in ""Management's Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity andCapital Resources -- Future Sources and Uses of Cash -- Impact on Liquidity of aDowngrade in Credit Ratings"" in Item 7 of this report. These credit ratings maynot remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of theseratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note thatthese credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold oursecurities. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Any future reduction                                        24or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverseimpact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms.  AS A HOLDING COMPANY WITH NO OPERATIONS OF OUR OWN, WE WILL DEPEND ON  DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET OUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND  PROVISIONS OF APPLICABLE LAW OR CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS COULD LIMIT THE  AMOUNT OF THOSE DISTRIBUTIONS.     We derive all our operating income from, and hold all our assets through,our subsidiaries. As a result, we will depend on distributions from oursubsidiaries in order to meet our payment obligations. In general, thesesubsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation toprovide us with funds for our payment obligations, whether by dividends,distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law,such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit their ability tomake payments or other distributions to us, and they could agree to contractualrestrictions on their ability to make distributions.     Our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the rightof our creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectivelysubordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including tradecreditors. In addition, even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary, our rightsas a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets ofthat subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held byus.  THE USE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BY US AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE NORMAL  COURSE OF BUSINESS COULD RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSSES THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.     We and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options,futures and forwards, to manage our commodity and financial market risks. We andour subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility inthe market values of these contracts, or should a counterparty fail to perform.In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information fromexternal sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involvemanagement's judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in theunderlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect thereported fair value of these contracts.RISKS COMMON TO OUR BUSINESSES AND OTHER RISKS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM  ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.     Our operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulationspertaining to health, safety and the environment. As an owner or operator ofnatural gas pipelines and distribution systems, gas gathering and processingsystems, and electric transmission and distribution systems we must comply withthese laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These lawsand regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways,such as:     - restricting the way we can handle or dispose of our wastes;     - limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such       as wetlands, coastal regions, or areas inhabited by endangered species;     - requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our       operations, or attributable to former operations; and     - enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with       permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations.     In order to comply with these requirements, we may need to spendsubstantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to:     - construct or acquire new equipment;     - acquire permits for facility operations;                                        25     - modify or replace existing and proposed equipment; and     - clean up or decommission waste disposal areas, fuel storage and       management facilities and other locations and facilities.     Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety ofadministrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including theassessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial actions, and theissuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutesimpose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up andrestore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwisereleased. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and otherthird parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedlycaused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into theenvironment.  OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. INSUFFICIENT INSURANCE COVERAGE  AND INCREASED INSURANCE COSTS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS.     We currently have general liability and property insurance in place tocover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate. Suchpolicies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not includebusiness interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in thefuture at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insuranceproceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities maynot be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on ourresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows.     In common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastalregions, CenterPoint Houston does not have insurance covering its transmissionand distribution system because CenterPoint Houston believes it to be costprohibitive. If CenterPoint Houston were to sustain any loss of, or damage to,its transmission and distribution properties, it may not be able to recover suchloss or damage through a change in its regulated rates, and any such recoverymay not be timely granted. Therefore, CenterPoint Houston may not be able torestore any loss of, or damage to, any of its transmission and distributionproperties without negative impact on its results of operations, financialcondition and cash flows.  WE, CENTERPOINT HOUSTON AND CERC COULD INCUR LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH  BUSINESSES AND ASSETS THAT WE HAVE TRANSFERRED TO OTHERS.     Under some circumstances, we and CenterPoint Houston could incurliabilities associated with assets and businesses we and CenterPoint Houston nolonger own. These assets and businesses were previously owned by Reliant Energy,a predecessor of CenterPoint Houston, directly or through subsidiaries andinclude:     - those transferred to RRI or its subsidiaries in connection with the       organization and capitalization of RRI prior to its initial public       offering in 2001; and     - those transferred to Texas Genco in connection with its organization and       capitalization.     In connection with the organization and capitalization of RRI, RRI and itssubsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businessesReliant Energy transferred to them. RRI also agreed to indemnify, and cause theapplicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and our subsidiaries,including CenterPoint Houston and CERC, with respect to liabilities associatedwith the transferred assets and businesses. The indemnity provisions wereintended to place sole financial responsibility on RRI and its subsidiaries forall liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses andoperations of RRI, regardless of the time those liabilities arose. If RRI isunable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in whichReliant Energy has not been released from the liability in connection with thetransfer, we, CenterPoint Houston or CERC could be responsible for satisfyingthe liability.     Prior to CenterPoint Energy's distribution of its ownership in RRI to itsshareholders, CERC had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what becameRRI's trading subsidiary. Under the terms of the separation agreement betweenthe companies, RRI agreed to extinguish all such guarantee obligations prior toseparation, but when separation occurred in September 2002, RRI had been unableto extinguish all                                        26obligations. To secure CenterPoint Energy and CERC against obligations under theremaining guarantees, RRI agreed to provide cash or letters of credit for thebenefit of CERC and CenterPoint Energy, and undertook to use commerciallyreasonable efforts to extinguish the remaining guarantees. Our current exposureunder the remaining guarantees relates to CERC's guarantee of the payment by RRIof demand charges related to transportation contracts with one counterparty. Thedemand charges are approximately $53 million per year in 2006 through 2015, $49million in 2016, $38 million in 2017 and $13 million in 2018. As a result ofchanges in market conditions, CenterPoint Energy's potential exposure under thatguarantee currently exceeds the security provided by RRI. CenterPoint Energy hasrequested RRI to increase the amount of its existing letters of credit or, inthe alternative, to obtain a release of CERC's obligations under the guarantee,and CenterPoint Energy and RRI are pursuing alternatives. RRI continues to meetits obligations under the transportation contracts.     RRI's unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade. If RRIwere unable to meet its obligations, it would need to consider, among variousoptions, restructuring under the bankruptcy laws, in which event RRI might nothonor its indemnification obligations and claims by RRI's creditors might bemade against us as its former owner.     Reliant Energy and RRI are named as defendants in a number of lawsuitsarising out of power sales in California and other West Coast markets andfinancial reporting matters. Although these matters relate to the business andoperations of RRI, claims against Reliant Energy have been made on grounds thatinclude the effect of RRI's financial results on Reliant Energy's historicalfinancial statements and liability of Reliant Energy as a controllingshareholder of RRI. We or CenterPoint Houston could incur liability if claims inone or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us orCenterPoint Houston and indemnification from RRI were determined to beunavailable or if RRI were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owedwith respect to those claims.     In connection with the organization and capitalization of Texas Genco,Texas Genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assetsReliant Energy transferred to it. Texas Genco also agreed to indemnify, andcause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify, us and oursubsidiaries, including CenterPoint Houston, with respect to liabilitiesassociated with the transferred assets and businesses. In many cases theliabilities assumed were obligations of CenterPoint Houston and CenterPointHouston was not released by third parties from these liabilities. The indemnityprovisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility onTexas Genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the currentand historical businesses and operations of Texas Genco, regardless of the timethose liabilities arose. In connection with the sale of Texas Genco's fossilgeneration assets (coal, lignite and gas-fired plants) to Texas Genco LLC, theseparation agreement we entered into with Texas Genco in connection with theorganization and capitalization of Texas Genco was amended to provide that allof Texas Genco's rights and obligations under the separation agreement relatingto its fossil generation assets, including Texas Genco's obligation to indemnifyus with respect to liabilities associated with the fossil generation assets andrelated business, were assigned to and assumed by Texas Genco LLC. In addition,under the amended separation agreement, Texas Genco is no longer liable for, andCenterPoint Energy has assumed and agreed to indemnify Texas Genco LLC against,liabilities that Texas Genco originally assumed in connection with itsorganization to the extent, and only to the extent, that such liabilities arecovered by certain insurance policies or other similar agreements held byCenterPoint Energy. If Texas Genco or Texas Genco LLC were unable to satisfy aliability that had been so assumed or indemnified against, and provided ReliantEnergy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer,CenterPoint Houston could be responsible for satisfying the liability.     We or our subsidiaries have been named, along with numerous others, as adefendant in lawsuits filed by a large number of individuals who claim injurydue to exposure to asbestos. Most claimants in such litigation have been workerswho participated in construction of various industrial facilities, includingpower plants. Some of the claimants have worked at locations we own, but mostexisting claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries butcurrently owned by Texas Genco LLC. We anticipate that additional claims likethose received may be asserted in the future. Under the terms of the separationagreement between us and Texas Genco, ultimate financial responsibility foruninsured losses from claims relating to facilities transferred                                        27to Texas Genco has been assumed by Texas Genco, but under the terms of ouragreement to sell Texas Genco to Texas Genco LLC, we have agreed to continue todefend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance we maintain,subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense from Texas Genco LLC"
