.The Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors including those material factors set forth below, those set forth in our “Forward Looking Statements” disclosure in Item 7 and those set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which could cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results and make an investment in the Company speculative or risky.Strategic, Business and Operational RisksThe Company’s earnings growth strategy is partially dependent on the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses.The Company has a history of acquiring businesses as part of its earnings growth strategy. Typically, the Company considers acquiring companies that can be integrated within an existing business. Acquisitions of this type involve numerous risks, which may include a failure to realize expected revenue growth and operating and cost synergies from integration initiatives, increasing dependency on the markets served by the combined businesses or increased debt to finance the acquisitions.The Company also considers the acquisition of businesses that may operate independent of existing businesses. Acquisitions of this type involve risks similar to those encountered when acquiring companies that can be integrated within an existing business, including a failure to realize expected revenue growth or operating and cost reductions within the acquired business, and could increase the possibility of diverting corporate management’s attention from its existing operations.The successful realization of revenue growth, cost reductions and synergies with our existing businesses, and within acquired stand-alone businesses, and increases in profitability overall, are dependent upon successful integration initiatives. If these integration initiatives are not fully realized, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including goodwill and/or intangible asset impairments, which may be material.Refer to Note 3 for recent acquisition information.The loss of, a significant decline in business with, or pricing pressure from, one or more of the Company’s key customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company's CCM segment operates in several niche markets in which a large portion of the segment’s revenues are attributable to a few large customers. See “Item 1. Business—Overview—Description of Businesses by Segment” for a discussion of customer concentrations for CCM. A significant reduction in purchases by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of one or more of the Company’s segments.Some of the Company’s key customers enjoy significant purchasing power that may be used to exert pricing pressure on the Company. Additionally, as many of the Company’s businesses are part of a long supply chain to the ultimate consumer, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected if one or more key customers elects to in-source or find alternative suppliers for the production of a product or products that the Company currently provides. Failure to successfully complete dispositions or restructuring activities could negatively affect the Company.From time to time, the Company, as part of its commitment to concentrate on its core business, may dispose of all or a portion of certain businesses. Such dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management's attention from the Company’s core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s cash flows and/or the Company’s ability to execute its strategy. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may undertake consolidation and other restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline its operations. Such restructuring activities may divert management's attention 9 Table of Contentsfrom the Company’s core businesses, increase expenses on a short-term basis and lead to potential disputes with the employees, customers or suppliers of the affected businesses. If restructuring activities are not completed in a timely manner or if anticipated cost savings, synergies and efficiencies are not realized, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Refer to Note 4 for a discussion of disposition matters.Industry and Macroeconomic RisksSeveral of the market segments that the Company serves are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and global economic conditions.Several of the market segments in which the Company sells its products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and may experience periodic downturns in demand. For example, the CCM and CWT segments are susceptible to downturns in the commercial construction industry, particularly in the construction repair and replacement sectors, and the CWT segment is susceptible to downturns in the residential construction industry.Uncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its customers, distributors and suppliers. Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, commercial and residential construction, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Company’s customers, distributors and suppliers, and therefore, the Company’s results of operations, margins and orders. The Company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide economic conditions will fluctuate. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company's control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.The Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal and business factors.The Company operates in global markets. Approximately 10% of the Company’s revenues in 2023 were generated outside the United States. In addition, to compete globally, both of the Company’s segments have manufacturing facilities outside the United States. In 2023, approximately 11% of cost of goods sold was derived from facilities outside of the United States.The Company’s reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, including import and export tariffs; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international labor, materials and shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies.The Company has significant concentrations in the construction market.Most of the Company’s revenues and operating income are generated from the construction market. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, new housing starts and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. A decline in the construction market, particularly in construction repair and replacement activities, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials.The CCM and CWT segments compete through pricing, among other factors. Competition in these segments may increase pricing pressure on the Company which may negatively affect operating results in future periods. 10 Table of ContentsRaw material costs are a significant component of the Company’s cost structure and are subject to volatility, including cost increases, significant disruptions to the Company's supply chains or significant shortages of materials.The Company utilizes petroleum-based products, chemicals, resins and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 67% of the Company’s cost of goods sold in 2023. Significant increases in the costs of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and significant disruption to the Company's supply chains or significant shortages of materials could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements, including import and export tariffs and global economic conditions. Refer to “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information regarding commodity price risk.Currency fluctuation could have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of business operations.The Company’s global revenues and other activities are translated into U.S. Dollars (""USD"") for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the USD could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into USD. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than our subsidiaries' functional currencies (primarily the USD, Euro, Chinese Renminbi and British Pound) expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to those functional currencies. Increased strength of the functional currency will decrease the Company’s reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent the Company is unable or determines not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the functional currency could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products. Many of the Company’s sales that are exported by its USD functional subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in USD, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the USD may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries’ products that are sold in USD within foreign locations. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations. See “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for a discussion on foreign currency exchange risk.Environmental, Regulatory and Legal RisksThe Company's operations are subject to risks related to environmental laws and regulations.We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners’ or operators’ releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment of, and compliance with, environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material, and the Company did not have any significant accruals related to potential future costs of environmental remediation as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, nor are any material asset retirement obligations recorded as of that date. However, the nature of the Company’s operations and its long history of industrial activities at certain of its current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities or asset retirement obligations. 11 Table of ContentsGlobal climate change and related regulations could negatively affect the Company.Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to GHG emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in the Company’s products or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns including GHG emissions, and the regulation of such concerns including climate-related disclosures, could subject the Company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs and other compliance requirements which could negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations and financial position. As of the date of this filing, we have made several public commitments regarding our intended reduction of GHG emissions, including commitments to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050 and the establishment of science-based targets to reduce GHG emissions from our operations and the operations of our value chain. Although we intend to meet these commitments, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. Further, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our commitments will be achieved, or that any future investments we make in furtherance of achieving such targets and goals will meet investor expectations or any binding or non-binding legal standards regarding sustainability performance. Moreover, we may determine that it is in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current commitments based on economic, regulatory and social factors, business strategy or pressure from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders. If we are unable to meet these commitments, then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups and other stakeholders, which could adversely impact the perception of our brands and our products and services by current and potential customers, as well as investors, which could in turn adversely impact our results of operations.General Risk Factors
The Company is subject to risks arising from widespread health emergencies.The Company’s businesses operate in market segments impacted by widespread health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating during a widespread health emergency exposes the Company to a number of risks, including diminished demand for our products and our customers’ products, suspensions in the operations of our manufacturing facilities, maintenance of appropriate labor levels, our ability to ship products to our customers, interruptions in our supply chains and distribution systems, increases in operating costs related to pay and benefits for our employees, collection of trade receivables in accordance with their terms, and potential impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, any of which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.While these risks have not to date, in the aggregate, had a material adverse impact on the Company, we are unable to predict the extent or duration of impacts from widespread health emergencies as they will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration and frequency of, and government responses to, such emergencies.Cybersecurity breaches or significant disruptions of our information technology systems or violations of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support critical business processes. Security breaches of these systems could result in the unauthorized or inappropriate access to confidential information or personal data entrusted to us by our business partners. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity breaches to our information technology systems, none of them to date has had a material impact on the Company. Additionally, these systems may be disrupted as a result of attacks by computer hackers or viruses, human error or wrongdoing, operational failures or other catastrophic events. The Company leverages its internal information technology infrastructures, and those of its business partners, to enable, sustain and protect its global business interests. However, any of the aforementioned breaches or disruptions could result in legal claims, liability or penalties under privacy laws or damage to operations or to the Company's reputation, which could adversely affect our business.We are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the ordinary course of business. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to privacy and 12 Table of Contentssecurity requirements, we may suffer regulatory consequences that could be costly or otherwise adversely affect our business"

For example, the CCM and CWT segments are susceptible to downturns in the commercial construction industry, particularly in the construction repair and replacement sectors, the CWT segment is susceptible to downturns in the residential construction industry, the CIT segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial aerospace industry and the CFT segment is susceptible to downturns in the automotive industry. Uncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its customers, distributors and suppliers. Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, commercial and residential construction, passenger airline travel, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Company’s customers, distributors and suppliers, and therefore, the Company’s results of operations, margins and orders. The Company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide economic conditions will fluctuate. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company's control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.The Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal and business factors.The Company operates in global markets. Approximately 14% of the Company’s revenues in 2022 were generated outside the United States. In addition, to compete globally, all of the Company’s segments have manufacturing facilities outside the United States. In 2022, approximately 12% of cost of goods sold was derived from facilities outside of the United States.The Company’s reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, including import and export tariffs; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international labor, materials and shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies.The Company has significant concentrations in the domestic construction market.For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 83% of the Company’s revenues and approximately 102% of its operating income were generated by the CCM and CWT segments, principally from the construction market. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, new housing starts and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. A decline in the construction market, particularly in construction repair and replacement activities, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials.The CCM and CWT segments compete through pricing, among other factors. Competition in this segment may increase pricing pressure on the Company which may negatively affect operating results in future periods. Raw material costs are a significant component of the Company’s cost structure and are subject to volatility, including cost increases, significant disruptions to the Company's supply chains or significant shortages of materials.The Company utilizes petroleum-based products, chemicals, resins and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 79% of the Company’s cost of 13 Table of Contentsgoods sold in 2022. Significant increases in the costs of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and significant disruption to the Company's supply chains or significant shortages of materials could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements, including import and export tariffs and global economic conditions. Refer to “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information regarding commodity price risk.Currency fluctuation could have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of business operations.The Company’s global revenues and other activities are translated into U.S. Dollars (""USD"") for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the USD could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into USD. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than our subsidiaries' functional currencies (primarily the USD, Euro, Chinese Renminbi and British Pound) expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to those functional currencies. Increased strength of the functional currency will decrease the Company’s reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent the Company is unable or determines not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the functional currency could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products. Many of the Company’s sales that are exported by its USD functional subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in USD, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the USD may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries’ products that are sold in USD within foreign locations. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations. See “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for a discussion on foreign currency exchange risk.Environmental, Regulatory and Legal RisksThe Company and certain of its customers’ operations are subject to regulatory risks.Certain products manufactured by our businesses and certain of our customers operating in the aerospace and medical markets are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA and EASA, and FDA, respectively. It can be costly and time-consuming for the Company and our customers to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and certifications to operate in these markets. Delays in FAA or EASA approvals or certifications of the products of our aerospace customers may impact the requirements for our interconnect components. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted for new medical devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Continued government scrutiny, including reviews of the FDA medical device pre-market authorization and post-market surveillance processes, may impact the requirements for our medical device components. Failure of the Company or any of its customers operating in these markets to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are also subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners’ or operators’ releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment of, and compliance with, environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material, and the Company did not have any significant accruals related to potential future costs of environmental remediation as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, nor are any material asset retirement obligations recorded as of that date. However, the nature of the Company’s operations and its long history of industrial activities at certain of its current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities or asset retirement obligations. 14 Table of ContentsGlobal climate change and related regulations could negatively affect the Company.Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to GHG emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in the Company’s products or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures.

The initial decline in domestic and international passenger airline travel caused by COVID-19 and foreign government lockdowns continue to impact demand for our products sold to customers operating in the commercial aerospace industry. While these COVID-19-related impacts have not to date, in the aggregate, had a material adverse impact on the Company, we are unable to predict the extent or duration of these impacts as they will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration and frequency of coronavirus outbreaks and government responses to such outbreaks.Cybersecurity breaches or significant disruptions of our information technology systems or violations of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support critical business processes.

Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, commercial and residential construction, passenger airline travel, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Company’s customers, distributors and suppliers, and therefore, the Company’s results of operations, margins and orders. The Company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide economic conditions will fluctuate. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company's control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.The Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal, and business factors.The Company operates in global markets. Approximately 16% of the Company’s revenues in 2021 were generated outside the United States. In addition, to compete globally, all of the Company’s segments have manufacturing 12 Table of Contentsfacilities outside the United States. In 2021, approximately 27% of cost of goods sold was derived from facilities outside of the United States.The Company’s reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, including import and export tariffs; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international labor, materials and shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies.The Company has significant concentrations in the domestic commercial construction market.For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 80% of the Company’s revenues and approximately 121% of its operating income were generated by the CCM segment. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. A decline in the commercial construction market, particularly in construction repair and replacement activities, could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials.The CCM segment competes through pricing, among other factors. Competition in this segment may increase pricing pressure on the Company which may negatively affect operating results in future periods. Raw material costs are a significant component of the Company’s cost structure and are subject to volatility, including cost increases, significant disruptions to the Company's supply chains or significant shortages of materials.The Company utilizes petroleum-based products, steel and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 78% of the Company’s cost of goods sold in 2021. Significant increases in the costs of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and significant disruption to the Company's supply chains or significant shortages of materials could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements, including import and export tariffs and global economic conditions. Refer to “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information regarding commodity price risk.Currency fluctuation could have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of business operations.The Company’s global revenues and other activities are translated into U.S. Dollars (""USD"") for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the USD could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into USD. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies (primarily the USD, Euro, Chinese Renminbi and British Pound) expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to those functional currencies. Increased strength of the functional currency will decrease the Company’s reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent the Company is unable or determines not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the functional currency could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products. Many of the Company’s sales that are exported by its USD functional subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in USD, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the USD may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries’ products that are sold in USD within foreign locations. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations. See “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for a discussion on foreign currency exchange risk.13 Table of ContentsEnvironmental, Regulatory and Legal RisksThe Company and certain of its customers’ operations are subject to regulatory risks.Certain products manufactured by our businesses and certain of our customers operating in the aerospace and medical markets are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA and EASA, and FDA, respectively. It can be costly and time-consuming for the Company and our customers to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and certifications to operate in these markets. Delays in FAA or EASA approvals or certifications of the products of our aerospace customers may impact the requirements for our interconnect components. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted for new medical devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Continued government scrutiny, including reviews of the FDA medical device pre-market authorization and post-market surveillance processes, may impact the requirements for our medical device components. Failure of the Company or any of its customers operating in these markets to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are also subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, chemical and hazardous waste management, and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners’ or operators’ releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment of, and compliance with, environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health, and safety requirements have not been material, and the Company did not have any significant accruals related to potential future costs of environmental remediation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, nor are any material asset retirement obligations recorded as of that date. However, the nature of the Company’s operations and its long history of industrial activities at certain of its current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities or asset retirement obligations. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to GHG emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in the Company’s products or facilities and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including GHG emissions, could subject the Company to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs and other compliance requirements which could negatively impact the Company’s reputation, business, capital expenditures, results of operations, and financial position. General Risk Factors
The Company is subject to risks arising from global pandemics, including COVID-19.The Company’s businesses operate in market segments currently being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating during a global pandemic exposes the Company to a number of risks, including diminished demand for our products and our customers’ products, suspensions in the operations of our manufacturing facilities, maintenance of appropriate labor levels and our ability to ship products to our customers, interruptions in our supply chains and distribution systems, increases in operating costs related to pay and benefits for our employees, collection of trade receivables in accordance with their terms, potential impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets; any of which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We have experienced, and could continue to experience, diminished demand for our products as a result of COVID-19. The decline in domestic and international passenger airline travel caused by COVID-19 is negatively impacting demand for our products sold to customers operating in the commercial aerospace industry. While these COVID-19 related impacts have not to date, in the aggregate, had a material adverse impact on the Company, we are unable to predict the extent or duration of these impacts as they will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration of the coronavirus outbreak, the timing and extent of increased passenger airline travel and nonresidential construction and construction repair and replacement activity, and the continued ability of our businesses to continue to operate within all applicable COVID-19 related government rules and regulations.14 Table of ContentsSecurity breaches or significant disruptions of our information technology systems or violations of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support critical business processes. Security breaches of these systems could result in the unauthorized or inappropriate access to confidential information or personal data entrusted to us by our business partners. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, security breaches to our information technology systems, none of them to date has had a material impact on the Company. Additionally, these systems may be disrupted as a result of attacks by computer hackers or viruses, human error or wrongdoing, operational failures or other catastrophic events. The Company leverages its internal information technology infrastructures, and those of its business partners, to enable, sustain and protect its global business interests, however, any of the aforementioned breaches or disruptions could result in legal claims, liability or penalties under privacy laws or damage to operations or to the Company's reputation, which could adversely affect our business.We are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of business. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to privacy and security requirements, we may suffer regulatory consequences that could be costly or otherwise adversely affect our business"
6,CSL,CARLISLE COS INC,2021-02-11,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
.The Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to those material factors set forth below, those set forth in our “Forward Looking Statements” disclosure in Item 7 and those set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which could cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results and make an investment in the Company speculative or risky.Strategic, Business and Operational RisksThe Company’s earnings growth strategy is partially dependent on the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses.The Company has a history of acquiring businesses as part of its earnings growth strategy. Typically, the Company considers acquiring companies that can be integrated within an existing business. Acquisitions of this type involve numerous risks, which may include a failure to realize expected revenue growth and operating and cost synergies from integration initiatives, increasing dependency on the markets served by the combined businesses or increased debt to finance the acquisitions.The Company also considers the acquisition of businesses that may operate independent of existing businesses that involve similar risks with respect to a failure to realize expected revenue growth or operating and cost reductions within the acquired business and could increase the possibility of diverting corporate management’s attention from its existing operations.The successful realization of revenue growth, cost reductions and synergies with our existing businesses, and within acquired stand-alone businesses, and increases in profitability overall, are dependent upon successful integration initiatives. If these integration initiatives are not fully realized, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.See Note 3 for recent acquisition information.The loss of, a significant decline in business with, or pricing pressure from, one or more of the Company’s key customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company operates in several niche markets in which a large portion of the segment’s revenues are attributable to a few large customers. See “Item 1. Business—Overview—Description of Businesses by Segment” for a discussion of customer concentrations by segment. A significant reduction in purchases by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of one or more of the Company’s segments.11Table of ContentsSome of the Company’s key customers enjoy significant purchasing power that may be used to exert pricing pressure on the Company. Additionally, as many of the Company’s businesses are part of a long supply chain to the ultimate consumer, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected if one or more key customers elects to in-source or find alternative suppliers for the production of a product or products that the Company currently provides. Dispositions, failure to successfully complete dispositions or restructuring activities could negatively affect the Company.From time to time, the Company, as part of its commitment to concentrate on its core business, may dispose of all or a portion of certain businesses. Such dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management's attention from the Company’s core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s cash flows and/or the Company’s ability to execute its strategy. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may undertake consolidation and other restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline its operations. Such restructuring activities may divert management's attention from the Company’s core businesses, increase expenses on a short-term basis and lead to potential disputes with the employees, customers or suppliers of the affected businesses. If restructuring activities are not completed in a timely manner or if anticipated cost savings, synergies and efficiencies are not realized, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Refer to Notes 4 and 8 for a discussion of disposition and restructuring matters.Industry and Macroeconomic RisksSeveral of the market segments that the Company serves are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and global economic conditions.Several of the market segments in which the Company sells its products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and may experience periodic downturns in demand. For example, the CBF segment is susceptible to downturns in the construction, agriculture and mining industries. The CIT segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial aerospace industry, the CCM segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial construction industry and the CFT segment is susceptible to downturns in the automotive industry. Uncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its customers, distributors and suppliers. Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, commercial and residential construction, passenger airline travel, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Company’s customers, distributors and suppliers, and therefore, the Company’s results of operations, margins and orders. The Company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide economic conditions will fluctuate. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company's control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.The Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal and business factors.The Company operates in global markets. Approximately 19% of the Company’s revenues in 2020 were generated outside the United States. In addition, to compete globally, all of the Company’s segments have manufacturing facilities outside the United States. In 2020, approximately 28% of cost of goods sold is derived from facilities outside of the United States.The Company’s reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, including import and export tariffs; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion or repatriation of 12Table of Contentsassets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international labor, materials and shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies.Additionally, there is uncertainty caused by the U.K.'s exit from the European Union commonly referred to as ""Brexit."" While the impacts of the E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement recently enacted in connection with Brexit are not yet known, Brexit could adversely impact the U.K. and/or the European Union, and therefore the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.The Company has significant concentrations in the domestic commercial construction market.For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 71% of the Company’s revenues and approximately 120% of its operating income were generated by the CCM segment. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. A decline in the commercial construction market could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials. Weather conditions can also be a positive factor, as demand for roofing materials may rise after harsh weather conditions due to the need for replacement materials. The CCM segment competes through pricing, among other factors. Competition in this segment may increase pricing pressure on the Company which may negatively affect operating results in future periods. Raw material costs are a significant component of the Company’s cost structure and are subject to volatility.The Company utilizes petroleum-based products, steel and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 61% of the Company’s cost of goods sold in 2020. Significant increases in the price of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements, including import and export tariffs and global economic conditions. Refer to “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information regarding commodity price risk.Regulatory and Legal RisksThe Company and certain of its customers’ operations are subject to regulatory risks.Certain products manufactured by our businesses and certain of our customers operating in the aerospace and medical markets are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA and EASA, and FDA, respectively. It can be costly and time-consuming for the Company and our customers to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and certifications to operate in these markets. Delays in FAA or EASA approvals or certifications of the products of our aerospace customers may impact the requirements for our interconnect components. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted for new medical devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Continued government scrutiny, including reviews of the FDA medical device pre-market authorization and post-market surveillance processes, may impact the requirements for our medical device components. Failure of the Company or any of its customers operating in these markets to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We are also subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges, chemical and hazardous waste management, and disposal.

Likewise, decreased strength of the functional currency could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products. Many of the Company’s sales that are exported by its USD functional subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in USD, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the USD may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries’ products that are sold in USD within foreign locations. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for additional information regarding commodity price risk.Dispositions, failure to successfully complete dispositions or restructuring activities could negatively affect the Company.From time to time, the Company, as part of its commitment to concentrate on its core business, may dispose of all or a portion of certain businesses. Such dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management's attention from the Company’s core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s cash flows and/or the Company’s ability to execute its strategy. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may undertake consolidation and other restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline its operations. Such restructuring activities may divert management's attention from the Company’s core businesses, increase expenses on a short-term basis and lead to potential disputes with the employees, customers or suppliers of the affected businesses. If restructuring activities are not completed in a 11Table of Contentstimely manner or if anticipated cost savings, synergies and efficiencies are not realized, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Refer to Notes 4 and 8 for a discussion of disposition and restructuring matters.Currency fluctuation could have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of business operations.The Company’s global revenues and other activities are translated into U.S. Dollars (""USD"") for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the USD could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into USD. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies (primarily the USD, Euro, Chinese Renminbi and British Pound) expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to those functional currencies. Increased strength of the functional currency will decrease the Company’s reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent the Company is unable or determines not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the functional currency could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products. Many of the Company’s sales that are exported by its USD functional subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in USD, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the USD may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries’ products that are sold in USD within foreign locations. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations. See “Part II—Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for a discussion on foreign currency exchange risk.Security breaches or significant disruptions of our information technology systems or violations of data privacy laws could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support critical business processes. Security breaches of these systems could result in the unauthorized or inappropriate access to confidential information or personal data entrusted to us by our business partners. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, security breaches to our information technology systems, none of them to date has had a material impact on the Company. Additionally, these systems may be disrupted as a result of attacks by computer hackers or viruses, human error or wrongdoing, operational failures or other catastrophic events. The Company leverages its internal information technology infrastructures, and those of its business partners, to enable, sustain and protect its global business interests, however, any of the aforementioned breaches or disruptions could result in legal claims, liability or penalties under privacy laws or damage to operations or to the Company's reputation, which could adversely affect our business.We are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed controls as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of business. If we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to privacy and security requirements, we may suffer regulatory consequences that could be costly or otherwise adversely affect our business"

. The Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to those set forth below, those set forth in our “Forward Looking Statements” disclosure in Item 7 and those set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, any one of which could cause the Company’s actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. The Company’s earnings growth strategy is partially dependent on the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses.The Company has a history of acquiring businesses as part of its earnings growth strategy. Typically, the Company considers acquiring companies than can be integrated within an existing business. Acquisitions of this type involve numerous risks, which may include a failure to realize expected revenue growth and operating and cost synergies from integration initiatives to combine the acquired business with an existing business; increasing dependency on the markets served by the combined businesses; increased debt to finance the acquisitions or the inability to obtain adequate financing on reasonable terms. 9Table of ContentsThe Company also considers the acquisition of businesses that may operate independent of existing businesses that involve similar risks with respect to a failure to realize expected revenue growth or operating and cost reductions within the acquired business; and could increase the possibility of diverting corporate management’s attention from its existing operations. The successful realization of revenue growth, cost reductions and synergies with our existing businesses, and within acquired stand-alone businesses, and therefore increases in profitability overall, is dependent upon successful integration initiatives. If these integration initiatives do not occur, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.See “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for recent acquisition information.Several of the market segments that the Company serves are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and global economic conditions.Several of the market segments in which the Company sells its products are, to varying degrees, cyclical and may experience periodic downturns in demand. For example, the CBF segment is susceptible to downturns in the construction, agriculture and mining industries. The CIT segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial airline industry, and the CCM segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial construction industry. Uncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its customers, distributors and suppliers. Among the economic factors which may affect performance are: manufacturing activity, commercial and residential construction, difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation, deflation, interest rates and credit availability. These effects may, among other things, negatively impact the level of purchases, capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Company’s customers, distributors and suppliers, and therefore, the Company’s results of operations, margins and orders. The Company cannot predict if, when or how much worldwide economic conditions will fluctuate. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Company's control. If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. The Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal and business factors.The Company has increased, and anticipates it will continue to increase, its presence in global markets. Approximately 22.7% of the Company’s revenues in 2018 were generated outside the United States. The Company expects these revenues will grow as the Company continues to target global markets. In addition, to compete globally, all of the Company’s segments have manufacturing facilities outside the United States. The Company’s increasing reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, including import and export tariffs; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies.Additionally, there is uncertainty caused by the U.K.'s planned exit from the European Union commonly referred to as ""Brexit."" While the specific terms and impact of Brexit are not yet known, Brexit could adversely impact the U.K. and/or the European Union, and therefore the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.The Company’s operations are subject to regulatory risks. Certain products manufactured by our businesses operating in the aerospace and medical markets are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA and FDA, respectively. It can be costly and time‑consuming to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals as well as maintain certifications to supply our products to OEM aerospace customers and to obtain regulatory approvals to market medical devices. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted 10Table of Contentsfor new devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Continued government scrutiny, including reviews of the FDA medical device pre‑market authorization and post‑market surveillance processes, may impact the requirements for our medical device interconnect components. Failure to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company has significant concentrations in the domestic commercial construction market.For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 64.3% of the Company’s revenues and approximately 85.5% of its operating income were generated by the CCM segment. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts and changes in construction spending by federal, state and local governments. A decline in the commercial construction market could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials. Weather conditions can also be a positive factor, as demand for roofing materials may rise after harsh weather conditions due to the need for replacement materials. The CCM segment competes through pricing, among other factors. Increased competition in this segment has placed, and could continue to place, negative pressure on operating results in future periods. The loss of, or a significant decline in business with, one or more of the Company’s key customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company operates in several niche markets in which a large portion of the segment’s revenues are attributable to a few large customers. See “Item 1. Business—Overview—Description of Businesses by Segment” for a discussion of customer concentrations by segment. A significant reduction in purchases by one or more of these customers could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of one or more of the Company’s segments. Some of the Company’s key customers enjoy significant purchasing power that may be used to exert pricing pressure on the Company. Additionally, as many of the Company’s businesses are part of a long supply chain to the ultimate consumer, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected if one or more key customers elects to in‑source or find alternative suppliers for the production of a product or products that the Company currently provides. Raw material costs are a significant component of the Company’s cost structure and are subject to volatility.The Company utilizes petroleum‑based products, steel and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 60% of the Company’s cost of goods sold in 2018. Significant increases in the price of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements, including import and export tariffs and global economic conditions.

For example, the Brake & Friction segment is susceptible to downturns in the construction, agriculture, and mining industries, the Interconnect Technologies segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial airline industry, and the Construction Materials segment is susceptible to downturns in the commercial construction industry. In addition, both the Interconnect Technologies segment and the Brake & Friction segment may be negatively impacted by reductions in military spending.  9 Current uncertainty regarding global economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the businesses, results of operations, and financial condition of the Company and its customers, distributors, and suppliers.

If these conditions deteriorate, however, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s growth is partially dependent on the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses. The Company has a long standing acquisition program and expects to continue acquiring businesses. Typically, the Company considers acquiring small companies in similar industries. Acquisitions of this type involve numerous risks, which may include potential difficulties integrating the business into existing operations; a failure to realize expected growth, synergies, and efficiencies; increasing dependency on the markets served by certain businesses, increased debt to finance the acquisitions or the inability to obtain adequate financing on reasonable terms. The Company also considers the acquisition of businesses that may operate independent of existing operations and could increase the possibility of diverting management’s attention from its existing operations. See “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for acquisition information. The successful integration of our acquired businesses is dependent upon the realization of efficiencies and synergies. If these integration initiatives do not occur, there may be a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. If the Company is unable to successfully integrate any acquired business or realize the growth, synergies, and efficiencies that were expected when determining the purchase price, goodwill and other intangible assets acquired may be considered impaired, resulting in an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations. See “Part II—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of factors considered in the subsequent valuation of the Company’s acquired goodwill and intangible assets. The Company has significant concentrations in the commercial construction market. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 56% of the Company’s revenues, and approximately 85% of its EBIT (excluding Corporate expenses and including impairment charges of $141.5 million) were generated by the Construction Materials segment. Construction spending is affected by economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic and population shifts, and changes in construction spending by federal, state, and local governments. A decline in the commercial construction market could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, adverse weather conditions such as heavy or sustained rainfall, cold weather and snow can limit construction activity and reduce demand for roofing materials. Weather conditions can also be a positive factor, as demand for roofing materials may rise after harsh weather conditions due to the need for replacement materials. The Construction Materials segment competes through pricing, among other factors. Increased competition in this segment has, and could, continue to place negative pressure on operating results in future periods.  10 The Company is subject to risks arising from international economic, political, legal, and business factors. The Company has increased, and anticipates that it will continue to increase, its presence in global markets. Approximately 23% of the Company’s revenues in 2016 were generated outside the United States. The Company expects this percentage will grow as the Company continues to expand its international sales efforts. In addition, to compete globally, all of the Company’s segments have operations outside the United States. The Company’s increasing reliance on international revenues and international manufacturing bases exposes its business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows to a number of risks, including price and currency controls; government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions; extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings, acts of terror, and riots; political instability; nationalization of private enterprises; hyperinflationary conditions; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations, currency conversion, or repatriation of assets; legal systems of decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations, and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied; cost and availability of international shipping channels; and customer loyalty to local companies. The loss of, or a significant decline in business with, one or more of the Company’s key customers could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company operates in several specialty niche markets in which a large portion of the segment’s revenues are attributable to a few large customers. See “Item 1. Business—Overview—Description of Businesses by Segment” for a discussion of customer concentrations by segment. A significant reduction in purchases by one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of one or more of the Company’s segments. Some of the Company’s key customers enjoy significant purchasing power that may be used to exert pricing pressure on the Company. Additionally, as many of the Company’s businesses are part of a long supply chain to the ultimate consumer, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected if one or more key customers elects to in‑source or find alternative suppliers for the production of a product or products that the Company currently provides. Raw Material costs are a significant component of the Company’s cost structure and are subject to volatility. The Company utilizes petroleum‑based products, steel, and other commodities in its manufacturing processes. Raw materials, including inbound freight, accounted for approximately 59% of the Company’s cost of goods sold in 2016. Significant increases in the price of these materials may not be recovered through selling price increases and could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The Company also relies on global sources of raw materials, which could be adversely impacted by unfavorable shipping or trade arrangements and global economic conditions. If the Company or its business partners are unable to adequately protect the Company’s information assets from cyber‑based attacks or other security incidents, the Company’s operations could be disrupted. The Company is increasingly dependent on information technology, including the internet, for the storage, processing, and transmission of its electronic, business‑related, information assets. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency, evolving in nature and include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in our systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and the corruption of data. The Company leverages its internal information technology infrastructures, and those of its business partners, to enable, sustain, and protect its global business interests. In the event that the Company or its business partners are unable to prevent, detect, and remediate cyber‑based attacks or other security incidents in a timely manner, the Company’s operations could be disrupted or the Company may incur financial or reputational losses arising from the theft, alteration, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, or destruction of its information assets. 11  Currency fluctuation could have a material impact on the Company’s reported results of business operations. The Company’s global net sales and other activities are translated into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. Dollars. In addition, sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. Increased strength of the U.S. Dollar will decrease the Company’s reported revenues or margins in respect of sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent the Company is unable or determines not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. Dollar could have a material adverse effect on the cost of materials and products purchased overseas. Many of the Company’s sales that are exported by its U.S. subsidiaries to foreign countries are denominated in U.S. Dollars, reducing currency exposure. However, increased strength of the U.S. Dollar may decrease the competitiveness of our U.S. subsidiaries’ products that are sold in U.S. Dollars within foreign locations. The Company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain of our results of operations and cash flows to such fluctuations. See “Part II—Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 19 – Foreign Currency Forward Contracts” for a discussion of these contracts. Dispositions, failure to successfully complete dispositions, or restructuring activities could negatively affect the Company. From time to time, the Company, as part of its commitment to concentrate on its core business, may dispose of all or a portion of certain businesses. Such dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from the Company’s core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses, and a potential dilutive effect on the Company’s earnings per share. If dispositions are not completed in a timely manner there may be a negative effect on the Company’s cash flows and/or the Company’s ability to execute its strategy.  Additionally, from time to time, the Company may undertake consolidation and other restructuring projects in an effort to reduce costs and streamline its operations. Such restructuring activities may divert management attention from the Company’s core businesses, increase expenses on a short‑term basis, and lead to potential disputes with the employees, customers or suppliers of the affected businesses. If restructuring activities are not completed in a timely manner or if anticipated cost savings, synergies, and efficiencies are not realized there may be a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. During 2016, the Company implemented cost reduction plans and incurred restructuring and severance charges of $15.5 million, primarily resulting from a reduction in workforce, facility consolidation and relocation, and lease termination costs associated with our Interconnect Technologies segment, Fluid Technologies segment and Corporate office. See “Part II—Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4 – Restructuring” for a discussion of these restructuring programs. The Company’s operations are subject to regulatory risks. Certain products manufactured by our businesses operating in the aerospace and medical markets are subject to extensive regulation by the FAA and FDA, respectively. It can be costly and time‑consuming to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals as well as maintain certifications to supply our products to OEM aerospace customers and to obtain regulatory approvals to market medical devices. Product approvals subject to regulations might not be granted for new devices on a timely basis, if at all. Proposed new regulations or changes to regulations could result in the need to incur significant additional costs to comply. Continued government scrutiny, including reviews of the FDA medical device pre‑market authorization and post‑market surveillance processes, may impact the requirements for our medical device interconnect components. Failure to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations or comply with existing and future laws and regulations may have a negative effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  12  "
